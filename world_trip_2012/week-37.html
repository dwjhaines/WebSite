                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 4th February
                </span>We were up for breakfast a bit earlier this morning and went straight out
                after eating to get a few more photos. We bought a few bottles of rum with some
                of the CUC's we had left over and returned to the hotel to pack. We checked out
                of the hotel at about 9:30 and got a taxi out to the airport. We checked in
                without any problems and had a couple of hours to wait for the 12:30 flight back
                to Cancun.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been undecided about whether or not to come to Cuba. At one point, it had
                seemed a lot less hassle just to stay in Mexico for the whole time. However,
                Havana has been well worth visiting for a couple of days. It has been an
                excellent place to wander round. The buildings and cars really do make it feel
                as if you have gone back in time by about 50 years. The food has not been great
                but the hotel was excellent (although that also has not changed much in the last
                50 years) and there have been some pretty good places for drinking in the
                evenings. It is probably not somewhere we will ever come back to but we are both
                glad that we made the effort to come when we did.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in Mexico by about 1pm local time. We cleared immigration and
                collected our luggage and were met outside the terminal by the Comfort Inn
                shuttle bus. We chose the Comfort Inn as it is handy for the airport and we have
                to go back there tomorrow to pick up our hire car. There is nothing anywhere
                near the hotel except a 7-11 and a Burger King. We had lunch from the 7-11, and
                after three days without internet access, spent the afternoon catching up with
                e-mail, etc. We ate at Burger King in the evening and had an early night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th February
                </span>We were up by 7:30 for the included breakfast. We got the shuttle bus
                back to the airport at 8:00 and walked from the terminal to the Alamo office. It
                took almost an hour to get the car. After filling out all the paperwork, paying
                for extra insurance and reducing the rental period by five days, we were shown
                round the car. It was a fairly old car covered in scratches which we were
                perfectly happy with. Just as we were completing the paperwork detailing all the
                marks, we were told they would upgrade the car to a newer model. We had to wait
                for this one to be cleaned, before checking for scratches again and finally
                leaving the rental office at 9ish. We returned to the hotel, collected our
                luggage and checked out at about 9:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Our first stop was Piste, a mile or so from Chichen Itza, home of some of the
                most famous and spectacular Mayan ruins. It took us around three hours to drive
                the 100 miles or so. The driving was fairly easy as the roads do not have a lot
                of traffic on them and, surprisingly the Mexicans seem to drive reasonably
                sensibly compared to in some parts of the world. The things that makes journeys
                slow is the number of speed humps as you go through every small town or village.
                These are quite steep and can not be ignored without seriously damaging the car.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had booked into the Best Western at Piste for two nights. We found the hotel
                easily as it is on the main road into the village. Our room was not ready when
                we arrived but we were able to check in after we had walked into the village for
                lunch.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had no plans to visit the ruins today so spent the rest of the afternoon by
                the pool. In the evening, we spent an hour or so looking into options for the 17
                days that we have the car for and walked back into the village for tea. We were
                back at the hotel by 9ish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 6th February
                </span>Another early start. We wanted to be in the ruins as early as possible.
                The place gets totally overrun with tourists from Cancun, Cozumel and Playa so
                we wanted to get in before the buses started arriving. It is also a lot cooler
                wandering around early in the morning. We left the hotel by 7:15 and had a 30
                minute walk to the main entrance, stopping for breakfast on the way. Getting
                there before 8 meant that there were only three people in the site ahead of us
                and about another five entered at about the same time.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6B-hqG4mydw/URPf9E0TFRI/AAAAAAAAJbY/7n3OQTZKSd0/s320/IMG_1483.JPG"
                width="320"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The ruins were quite impressive, particularly the main pyramid. We spent about
                two hours in total walking around, covered just about the whole site and managed
                to see all the main ruins listed in our guide book. It was good being able to
                walk round the site before large numbers of tourists arrived. Most of the
                souvenir sellers were still setting up their stalls as we were leaving.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Although, very enjoyable and well worth visiting, the ruins did not compare to
                ones we have seen in Egypt, Myanmar or Cambodia. This is supposed to be the most
                spectacular Mayan ruin in the area and, by the time we left, we were both
                already thinking about removing some of the more minor sites from our itinerary!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by 11 and did not do much for the rest of the day. We
                had tacos for lunch at the same place as yesterday and spent most of the
                afternoon reading, lying by the pool or booking places for later in the trip.
                Neither of us could be bothered to go back to the ruins to see the sound and
                light show in the evening. We ate at the same small cafe type place in Piste's
                main square and, after stopping for a couple of souvenirs, were back at the
                hotel by 9:00.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th February
                </span>Roz's birthday! We were up by about 8:30 and walked into the village
                again for breakfast. The food in Piste has been excellent. Every meal has been
                from small cafes or stalls serving very cheap and very good Mexican food.
                Probably the most enjoyable food since we have been in Mexico. We had a couple
                of hours back at the hotel reading or lying by the pool before checking out at
                11:45.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were heading for Merida but took a slight detour on the way to visit Izamal.
                This had a fairly good write up in Lonely Planet but was a far nicer place than
                we expected. It is an old Spanish colonial town with a restored town centre, a
                monastery and another Mayan pyramid. The whole place looked as if it should be
                packed with tourists but it is slightly off the beaten track and tourism seems
                yet to have taken off there. This meant that you could just drive into the main
                square and park without paying and start walking round the sights. The monastery
                was free to walk around and it was also free to climb up the pyramid. We had
                very good, cheap meals again overlooking the monastery and the people there
                seemed genuinely friendly unlike a lot of places where they are used to dealing
                with large numbers of tourists.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Izamal by about 3:00 and continued driving to Merida. We had a few
                problems getting to our hotel as a lot of the streets in the centre were closed
                due to a carnival or something but we were there by about 4:30. After checking
                in, we walked out to a supermarket. Our room has a "kitchenette" so we bought
                drinks for this evening and food for breakfast tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We began the birthday celebrations at about 6:30. We had a few glasses of wine
                and beers sat on the balcony outside our room before heading out to find
                somewhere to eat. We found a "Mayan Pub" which had 2-for-1 cocktails so had a
                few margaritas and ended up eating there as well. We would of stayed there
                longer but it was another place that had very poor service. We could not find
                anywhere else we liked the look of so, after eating, we returned to the balcony
                and got through about half of the rum we had bought before leaving Havana.
                Neither of us remember going to bed.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 8th February
                </span>Spent most of the morning recovering from last night. When we did get up,
                I walked back to the supermarket and got my hair cut on the way.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a walk round the sights during the afternoon. There is nothing
                particularly spectacular to see in Merida but it is a nice enough place to
                wander around with a main square, a cathedral and plenty of old colonial style
                buildings. A lot of it was fenced off again due to the carnival but we got to
                see everything that we wanted to.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not be bothered to go too far in the evening so had a pizza from a
                restaurant near the hotel. A very good meal again and we were back at the hotel
                just after 8.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 9th February
                </span>We had breakfast in the room and then had a couple of hours watching the
                football. We have been pretty lucky with the games we have been able to watch in
                the last few weeks and this run continued. We did not have ESPN in the room but
                the only sports channel we did have was showing Sunderland v Arsenal. The
                Swansea v QPR game was on the Danish TV channel that I can get on the laptop so
                we were both able to watch our games (with slightly different levels of
                enjoyment!)</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel straight after the games had finished and drove to
                the next set of ruins on our itinerary - Uxmal. We got to Uxmal just before 1pm.
                Uxmal is one of the most spectacular sets of ruins in the area but is a lot less
                visited because of its location. It is much further from the main tourist
                resorts than Chichen Itza. We both enjoyed these ruins more than Chichen Itza.
                The ruins were less spread out. Because there are less tourists, you were
                allowed to enter more of the buildings and climb up a lot of them including the
                big pyramid. This gave excellent views across the site.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ArLRyY3ifUA/URgUHn9u7uI/AAAAAAAAJho/BVDH8u2f2sg/s320/IMG_7278.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were out of the ruins by 2:30, ate the remains of last night's pizza in the
                car park and continued on our way to Campeche, 110 miles away. We got to our
                hotel in Campeche at about 5:30. Campeche is another place with nothing too
                spectacular to see but a really nicely restored town centre.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                One of the reasons we had decided to stay two nights here is that it also has a
                bar that sounded very good. We had a couple of drinks sat by our hotel pool and
                then went out to find it. Unfortunately the bar was closed and showed no signs
                of opening. There also seemed to be nowhere around that sold any alcohol. In
                most places we have been in Mexico, nearly every shop seems to sell beer but
                no-where here did.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked down to the sea-front where the carnival was just finishing (February
                appears to be the time for carnivals in Mexico) and found a few beer tent type
                things that were selling litre bottles of Sol for 35 pesos. We spent a couple of
                hours sat there and it was quite an enjoyable evening. There was loads of people
                about from the carnival and it seemed as good a place as any to sit. When we
                left there, we could still not find anywhere to buy more drinks so we bought a
                cheap cool box and some ice and returned to the hotel to finish our Cuban rum.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 10th February
                </span>Another day of not doing a lot. We went out for a late breakfast at 11ish
                and also walked around the town. About 2000 buildings have been completely
                restored and painted in bright pastel colours along cobbled streets. The main
                square has a cathedral and there are remains of the old city walls dotted around
                the centre. We spent an hour or so wandering around the streets then went back
                to the hotel for a couple of hours.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At 4ish, we went out again and completed the walking tour from Lonely Planet,
                (our bar was open today and did look good but we did not stop for a drink)
                ending up on the seafront where we had been last night. We walked back to the
                hotel for showers and went out to eat at a restaurant a block away from our
                hotel.</p>
