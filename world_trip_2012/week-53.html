                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 27th May
                </span>We did three dives today back at Balicasag Island. There was only one
                other customer on the boat - Akitoshi, an OW diver from Japan as well as Edgar,
                our guide. The first dive was at "Diver's Heaven" a spectacular wall. We saw a
                turtle within about 30 seconds of going down and also got sent down to 31m to
                see a giant frog fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Royal Garden again, the site we
                dived first yesterday. We went in the other direction today after seeing the
                jacks and it was a better dive. There were loads of turtles at the end and Roz
                counted 14 in total. For the third dive, it was just the two of us so Roz chose
                to dive the same site again. No jacks this time and not as many turtles but
                there seemed to be more fish and it was another good dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by around 4:00. We finished the pizza from last night
                on our balcony and I went out to get my hair cut. We had a few drinks in the
                evening. Alcohol is still very cheap here so we sat on our balcony with a bottle
                of rum before going out to eat. We ate at Graziella's again although we had
                pasta instead of pizza tonight, and then returned to the balcony to finish the
                rum while following the play-off final on the lap-top.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 28th May
                </span>Did not do too much all day today. We got up late and went out for
                breakfast. While out, we bought tickets for the 7:05 ferry back to Cebu for
                tomorrow morning and went to the dive centre to pay our bill. The weather was
                poor today so most of the rest of the day was spent in the room reading or
                editing photos. We went out to eat relatively early&nbsp; - pizzas at
                Graziella's again - and were back in the room by 8:00.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 29th May
                </span>We were awake just after 5:00 as we had a taxi booked for 5:45. The taxi
                was there early and by 5:40 we were on our way into Tagbilaran. We were dropped
                at the ferry terminal and we checked in for the 7:05 ferry back to Cebu. The
                ferry left a few minutes late and got us back to Cebu City just after 9:00. We
                got a taxi from the port to the Southern bus station.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz sat at the bus station for almost an hour while I went out to sort out money
                and pick up some other things that we needed. The ATM's in Alona all charged to
                take out money so I wandered round Cebu until I found one that was free. Using
                two transactions with each of our cards I was able to take out the £600 worth of
                pesos that we will need for the rest of our stay in The Philippines. I also
                bought more Doxycycline as my boil has not totally cleared up yet and I finished
                the previous course of antibiotics today. I think it is fine but taking Doxy for
                another week will not do any harm and I want to ensure the infection does not
                come back.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually got onto a bus heading for Moalboal at about 10:30 and it pulled
                out of the bus station about 10 minutes later. We were on a non air-conditioned
                bus but it was a lot more comfortable than the one we were on when we did this
                journey last August. There were not as many people on it and we were able to
                have three seats between the two of us. It did not rain on this journey which
                meant no-one closed the windows which also made it a much better journey. We
                arrived at Moalboal at about 1:15 and got a motorbike tricycle thing out to the
                beach. By 1:30 we had checked into the same room we had been in last time at Quo
                Vadis Resort. This was one of our favourite places during the first part of the
                trip so we booked another nine nights here.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch in the resort restaurant and then spent an hour or so by the pool.
                In the evening, we ate out at "The Last Filling Station", the restaurant we had
                eaten in most evenings when we were here last time. We had pizzas again. We will
                try and be more adventurous tomorrow!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 30th May
                </span>Three dives today. The morning dive was at Moalboal Bay. It was a wall
                dive (most of the diving here is on walls). A nice enough dive although the vis
                was not as good as when we were here last year. We saw a couple of turtles, and
                two pygmy sea-horses. There were a lot more people diving than last time we were
                here meaning we were in a group of about 8 people (led by Dhodho) which was not
                ideal but still a good dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at 2 in the afternoon was over at Pescador
                Island, about 10 minutes away by boat. Again, the vis was not as good as last
                year but the big school of sardines has returned which made a spectacular start
                to the dive. For the third dive we were on the house reef just in front of the
                resort. We were joined by three other divers and after a lot of messing around,
                did not get in the water until about 5:25. This meant that really we were doing
                a night dive as it was completely dark after about 20 minutes. Not the best dive
                of the day! Still a good days diving with at least one turtle on each dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had washed our gear and had showers, it was getting on for 7:30.
                We had a couple of drinks while we did our log books and then returned to The
                Last Filling Station. We decided against being adventurous and had pizza again
                before going back to the balcony and drinking half a bottle of rum. Got to bed
                just after 11:00.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 31st May
                </span>A similar day to yesterday. Three dives all along the walls of the island
                near the resort i.e. no trip to Pescador today. The morning and afternoon boat
                dives were at Lo-ok and Talisay. Five turtles on the first dive and one more on
                the second. There were less divers on the boat today and there were just three
                others with us and Dhodho. This was a big improvement on yesterday. For the
                third dive, Roz and I dived the house reef on our own without a guide. We were
                in the water almost an hour earlier than yesterday and it was a far more
                enjoyable dive because of this.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We also had a similar evening to yesterday. Beers on the balcony, pizzas at The
                Last Filling Station and then we finished the other half of the bottle of rum.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st June
                </span>Another similar day with three more dives. Our first dive was back at
                Pescador Island. We dived "The Cathedral" this time and it was probably the best
                dive we have had since getting here. There were only two other fun divers on the
                boat today, Dirk and Anke, and the visibility at Pescador was a lot better than
                a couple of days ago. The cathedral is a big cave type thing from about 15m
                going down to just below 30m. There are stunning views looking out from inside
                the cave. On the wall after leaving the cave, we saw an electric clam, the frog
                fish and another turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive in the afternoon was back on one of the local walls. A very good
                dive again with five turtles and a robust ghost pipe fish. For the third dive,
                we were on our own on the house reef again. We went in the opposite direction to
                yesterday as the current had changed and we did see a couple of turtles this
                time.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did manage to make it past The Last Filling Station in the evening and ate at
                Chili Bar. I had an excellent half pound cheese-burger and chips with a few San
                Miguels. As usual, we returned to our balcony for a few run and cokes before
                bed.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd June
                </span>
                Another excellent dive at Pescador to start the day. The boat was quite busy
                again this morning but it was only Roz and I that were fun diving (although
                Dhodho had his son, Bogs, diving with him this morning). Most of the other
                customers on the boat were on courses or snorkelling. We spent the first 40
                minutes of the dive watching the sardines. They had been quite spectacular a
                couple of days ago but today the vis was a lot better and there seemed to be ten
                times as many of them. This was a superb experience as they kept swarming around
                us. The remainder of the dive was also pretty good with plenty to see.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time it cam to the afternoon dive, we were the only two customers on the
                boat. We dived at Tongo. It was not as good as this mornings dive but we still
                saw a pygmy sea-horse and our only turtle of the day. We only did two dives
                today so were finished by about 3:30. Did not do a lot for the rest of the day
                but did manage to go out for a meal that did not consist of pizza or burgers.</p>
