                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 26th November
                </span>The start of a few days without a lot to do. Spent most of the day
                reading or lying by the pool. The weather was not great - we had quite a lot of
                rain and cloud during the day. Ate lunch at Kaw Kwang and walked into Saladan to
                eat at Lanta Seafood in the evening. We managed to get confirmation today that
                we can stay in our room for an extra 6 nights so will be here until December
                5th.</p>

                    <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 27th November
                    </span>Another cloudy day with not too much sun The rainy season should of
                    finished by now but it seems to be lingering. Plenty of rain again in the
                    afternoon. Could not be bothered to walk into Saladan for lunch so ate at the
                    resort again.
                </p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    We had a couple of drinks on the balcony while waiting for the rain to stop in
                    the evening. It was dry by about 8 so we were able to walk along the beach to
                    Hans. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and another at Nong's on the way
                    back. Ended up a lot more drunk than we had planned to!</p>

                    <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 28th November
                    </span>Spent most of the morning in bed recovering from last night. It was
                    sunnier today so we could spend a few hours by the pool again in the afternoon.
                    Did not really do a lot else. It rained again in the evening. We waited for it
                    to stop before walking into Saladan to eat again.</p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    In the last few days, we have just about finalised our plans for the last two
                    and a half months of our trip before we return home to look for work. We have
                    managed to get a few things booked as well.</p>

                    <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 29th November
                    </span>Three more dives today. We were picked up at about 7:50 and were driven
                    to the boat again. We had booked a three dive trip&nbsp; Ko Ha, a group of five
                    or six islands just under two hours away (Ha means five but there is a sixth
                    island in the group). The boat was fuller today. Ko Ha is easier diving so
                    plenty of students, DSD's and snorkelers were on the boat.
                </p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    We were in a better group today with an instructor who knew the sites (Anton)
                    and two other experienced divers. All three dives were pretty good. Ko Ha is not
                    the most spectacular of sites but there was enough to see, including lots of
                    little yellow box fish and it was another enjoyable day's diving.</p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    We were back at Kaw Kwang by 5:30. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony
                    while writing up log books. Could not be bothered to go out any where to eat so
                    ate in the Kaw Kwang restaurant and had an early night.</p>
                <p class="diary-text">
                    <span class="diary-date">Friday, 30th November
                    </span>Another quiet day. We spent the morning by the pool and then spent an
                    hour or so writing postcards to be sent instead of Christmas cards. We walked
                    into Saladan for lunch at Lanta Seafood again. We posted the postcards, took out
                    money, bought a Thai SIM card and paid for next week's visa run. We have paid
                    Baht1100 (about £22) each to go on a minibus all the way to the Malaysian
                    border and back next Tuesday a journey of about 11 hours if we are lucky. We
                    really needed to go on the Wednesday but the trip only goes every other day at
                    the moment. The organised trip will be a lot easier than trying to do it
                    ourselves on the Wednesday but means that we will overstay by one day when we
                    leave Thailand to fly home. Apparently, Thai immigration are not bothered if the
                    overstay is only one day so we should not have any problems! We stocked up on
                    drinks (and festive Pringles) and walked back to Kaw Kwang again.</p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    I ran along the beach in the evening but by the time I had come out of the
                    shower, it was raining heavily again. Still no sign of the wet season ending! We
                    had planned to walk to Hans to eat but again decided to eat at Kaw Kwang due to
                    the weather. Food is very good at Kaw Kwang so not the end of the world!</p>

                <p class="diary-text">
                    <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st December
                    </span>Our third and last days diving with Kon-Tiki. A similar day to last
                    Saturday i.e. a 6:40 pick-up and three dives at Hin Muang, Hin Daeng and Ko Ha.
                    All three dives were very good. The conditions at Hin Muang/Hin Daeng were
                    excellent again. There was a bit more current than last week but better
                    visibility making the dives slightly better. We dived at Ko Ha #1 on the way
                    back. We have dived this site many times but not for a few yeas. Neither of us
                    could remember the chimney that was probably the highlight of the dive so not
                    sure if we have dived the same part of the island before. Overall, Kon-Tiki have
                    been pretty good to dive with although the shortened dive times mean that we
                    probably would not choose to dive with them again.</p>

                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

                <p class="diary-text">
                    We were back about half an hour later than last week so were not back in the
                    room until about 7:30. We had a couple of beers on the balcony before walking to
                    Hans to eat. We went to D. R. Lanta hoping to watch Arsenal v Swansea but they
                    were already showing a different game which one person wanted to watch.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">Someone there told us of another bar that may show it
                    further down the beach. We walked down to "Indian Bar" which did have the game
                    and was probably a better place to watch the game anyway. After watching Swansea
                    beat Arsenal, we stopped at D.R. Lanta for the first half of Reading v Man U
                    although things are a bit vague in my memory by then. Don't really remember
                    walking back to Kaw Kwang.</p>

                    <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd December
                    </span>Slept for most of the morning and made it to the pool by about 2:00. We
                    had a few drinks again in the evening. The Norwich v Sunderland was the late
                    kick-off. As usual, we had a couple of drinks on the balcony before heading to
                    Hans to eat. We got to D. R. Lanta by 10:45 and watched the game in there. We
                    were back in the room by 2am, slightly more sober than last night but not by a
                    lot.</p>
