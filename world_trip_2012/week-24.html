                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 5th November
                </span>We had agreed a 3:30pm check out from the hotel so had an extra few hours
                making the most of the pool, the Wi-Fi and the air-conditioned room before
                beginning our over-night journey to Sorong where we will join up with Black
                Manta again. We left the hotel at about 3:45 and got taken to the airport. We
                checked in without any problems for the 18:40 flight to Ujung Pandang (Makasar)
                in Sulawesi. The flight was slightly late taking off but this did not really
                matter as we were expecting a nine hour wait for the next flight!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Bali has been really enjoyable for the last five weeks. The diving has been
                excellent, particularly at Jemeluk and Tulamben. The break in between at Ubud
                was better than expected, and as always, Kuta was an ideal place to spend a few
                days drinking too much. We have been really lucky with the weather. October is
                supposed to be the start of the wet season. It has started getting a bit cloudy
                the last couple of days but still no sign of the rain which was a bonus. The
                food has also been really good most of the places we have been. We have mostly
                stuck to Indonesian food for our time here but the Italian food of the last
                three days has been a highlight!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We landed in Makasar at about 8:30. The airport had been greatly modernised
                since we were last here, or replaced by a newer airport - we were not really
                sure. Either way, it meant that we could collect our luggage and stay in the
                main part of the airport which still had some restaurants and shops open instead
                of having to wait outside for most of the night as we had half expected. After
                eating, we found some seats in the departure area and sat down to wait for our
                onward flight to Sorong at 4:30am.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 6th November
                </span>The eight hour wait at the airport went reasonably quickly, I think
                because the airport was all a lot better than we had been expecting. We were
                able to check in and get rid of our luggage at half past midnight and found
                another row of seats to wait for our flight. The flight was slightly late again
                but not by much and we landed in Sorong, West Papua at about 8am.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were met at the airport by Cedric who was also picking up ten others from the
                same flight. The twelve of us were all driven to the harbour and then taken by
                the speed boats to Black Manta. We were on-board by about 8:30. We had the same
                cabin as on the previous trip and also managed to set up our gear in the same
                place on the dive deck. All the other fifteen guests on the boat were travelling
                together and knew each other. Most of them were from Australia but there was
                also one Kiwi and a couple of Americans. Also unlike most live-aboards we go on,
                almost everyone else was older than us.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p_i7kyp-LY0/UKWyY7pSooI/AAAAAAAAH9Q/P58QnLhtJm0/s320/IMG_5382.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were unsure whether or not we would be diving on the first day of the trip.
                Diving on the first day was not on the itinerary but we knew it was possible if
                everyone was on-board early enough and the boat could get all the required
                paperwork sorted out.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The boat eventually left Sorong at 1pm and, after a few hours sleep, we were
                able to do our first dive at 5:30. We were diving with Stanny again, the same
                guide we had on the previous trip. Also diving with us were Joey and Matthew who
                were both diving with very professional looking camera equipment.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                This was a pretty good dive to start the trip. The dive site would of been very
                nice in daylight as it seemed to have a lot of very colourful coral and plenty
                of fish but it was just about a night dive by the time we got in. The highlight
                of the dive was the two wobbegong sharks that we have never seen before but are
                quite common in this area.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Everyone on the boat had had a longer, more tiring journey than us to get to
                Sorong so the first night of the trip was not a late one. I think we were asleep
                by 9:00</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 7th November
                </span>First dive of the day was at "Manta Sandy" or "Manta Spa". This was a
                brilliant dive. We all got into the water and went down to a line of broken
                coral at about 15m. From there, we all watched as huge mantas swam around the
                cleaning stations just above us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not see as many manta as at Komodo but we were
                watching them closely for a whole hour instead of just getting glimpses of them
                as they swan past us. As well as coming very close to us, they were as big as
                any manta we have seen before.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive, "Cape Kri" was a bit more challenging. It was a nice enough
                site but although the conditions were OK at the start of the dive, the currents
                picked up a lot after the first 10 minutes or so. We had been told in the
                briefing that we we would be diving the site in "perfect conditions" but this
                was not the case! It meant that we got swept along the site very quickly and
                then had to swim back into the current to continue the dive. The currents were
                worse as we came shallower meaning that we had to stay down at 18m and got
                through air a lot quicker than usual. I went from 120 Bar to 80 Bar in about 4
                minutes and we all ended the dive after 46 minutes. There were a lot of fish
                around as well as a few sharks in the deeper parts and it would of been a very
                nice dive apart from the currents. Dive number three was similar to the previous
                one - lots of fish and lots of current. It was a bit better in that we did not
                have to do much swimming into the current but still used a lot of air just
                making sure we did not get swept along the dive site too quickly.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The night dive was quite good. It was nice to be diving without having to fight
                current after the two previous dives! We saw plenty of shrimps and crabs as well
                as another wobbegong and a brief glimpse of a "walking shark" - something else
                that we had never seen before. Once again, it was not a late night although we
                did manage to stay awake about an hour longer than last night.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th November
                </span>The first two dives of the day were at the same site - Mike's Point. The
                first dive was very good and at a part of the site that was sheltered from the
                current. Again there were lots of fish particularly in the shallows. We also saw
                our first turtle of this live-aboard as well as a few bump-heads and another
                wobbegong. After yesterday's dives, a lot of people on the boat were keen to do
                a second dive here instead of risking getting caught in current again. For the
                second dive, our group went in at the other side of the island, let the current
                bring us back round to the sheltered side and ended up in the same place as on
                the previous dive. This was another good dive with a white-tip reef shark at the
                start of the dive and large schools of fusiliers at the end.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive at "Sardines" also had a huge amount of fish. There were a couple
                of sharks, a couple of wobbegongs but once again, it was the quantity of fish
                all over the site that made this a good dive. There was some current to swim
                into as we came back across the reef but it was no-where near as strong as
                yesterday and we were able to complete a one hour dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We only did three dives today. Once the third dive was over, the boat began it's
                two night journey to Manokwari and Cenderawasih Bay. We will have a days diving
                at Palau Amsterdam tomorrow (three dives again) before continuing overnight,
                arriving in Manokwari by Saturday morning.</p>

                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-d-s7KioHx0A/UKWwOY4dDnI/AAAAAAAAH8w/zQJMwYWzOgw/s320/IMG_5621.JPG">

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 9th November
                </span>We did two dives at Palau Amsterdam, both at the same site - Junkyard.
                These were not the best dives we have ever done. There was a small wreck to look
                around and a sandy slope with a few nudi's on it but not too much else.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After the second dive, it was decided to start moving towards Manokwari again
                and stop for the third dive on the way. This did not prove to be a great
                decision! The third dive was an exploratory dive i.e. we stopped in the middle
                of no-where, found a suitable looking spot and jumped in to see if there was
                anything there...... there wasn't...... not a single fish! We gave up after
                about 20 minutes of swimming around in terrible visibility over sand and
                continued on our way to Manokwari.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                There was no night dive again tonight so it was a relatively early end to the
                day. Did not do a lot for the rest of the day apart from reading and editing
                pictures from previous days diving. Dinner was earlier than usual at 6:30 so
                most people had gone to bed by 8:30.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 10th November
                </span>We arrived in Manokwari, at the entrance to Cenderawasih Bay at 9ish.
                Cedric went off in one of the zodiacs to report to the police, the national park
                office and the harbour authorities. Diving in this area requires a lot of
                paperwork and there are a lot of officials that require "gifts" before
                permission is given. It is the first time that Black Manta has done this trip
                and will also be the last due to the hassle involved. Cedric was still not back
                by 11:00 but we got a phone call saying that it was OK to dive at "Shinma Maru"
                the Japanese wreck in the harbour. This was a pretty good dive. The vis was not
                great but the wreck was in good condition and there was no current. Stanny, Joey
                and Matthew were all either diving on air or had their computers set to air so
                left us half way through the dive but we had a full hour on the wreck. We did
                the same wreck for the second dive after Cedric had returned at 1:00. We went
                deeper at the stern on this dive and also spent more time inside the hulls.
                Again, it was an enjoyable dive.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rgHYiQAq6Ak/UKWxsIvnfRI/AAAAAAAAH9A/oLFI56zDL-8/s320/IMG_5636.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were supposed to do a third dive at another wreck not too far from the last
                one. Again, Cedric had to go ashore to get permission, this time from the head
                of the village nearest the dive site. This time he was unsuccessful. Despite the
                presence of a national park ranger who has to accompany us while we are in the
                area, the head of the village, who was drunk, would not agree to let us dive.
                This meant effectively that we have had two days in a row with only two dives
                and while the dives have been OK, they have not really been what we have come to
                this area for. Hopefully things will improve tomorrow!
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Due to the early finish to a fairly frustrating day, we decided it was time to
                have a few drinks for the first time since Kuta. We had bought bottles of rum
                with us and got through one of them during the evening. The rest of the people
                on board are quite interesting to talk to. More than half of them are in some
                way connected to S.P.U.M.S. (South Pacific Underwater Medical Society) which is
                how they all know each other. Plenty of doctors and nurses on board! Despite the
                alcohol, it was still an early night and we were back in the cabin by about
                9:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 11th November
                </span>A much better day today! After the problems of yesterday, Cedric decided
                to take the boat out to sea and dive around Tridacna Atoll. This meant we were
                no-where near land so there was no paperwork to sort out or permissions
                required. The first dive at "Mark's Treasure" was a nice enough wall dive. We
                had been told before the dive that there were turtles around and Roz managed to
                see three. The second dive at "Wild Fish Ridge" was excellent and one of the
                best so far on this trip. There were a few big schools of fish at the start of
                the dive but the hard coral all over this site was really spectacular. There was
                loads of overlapping plate coral and huge formations of barrel sponges. It was
                superb to look at and much more how I'd imagined the diving at Raja Ampat would
                be.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive (Spag Point) was similar to the second but not quite as good. We
                did see another turtle however. The fourth dive was another "exploratory" dive.
                We stopped at the corner of an island and jumped in again without knowing if
                there would be anything there. This dive was a lot better than the one two days
                ago. There was enough nudi's and crabs to make it a reasonably enjoyable night
                dive.</p>
