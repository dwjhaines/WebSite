                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 20th May
                </span>We checked out at 11:00and were transferred to Jemeluk Beach, about 25
                minutes away. We have stayed in Jemeluk a couple of times before but had chosen
                different accommodation this time. The last time we were here, our room was not
                air-conditioned and we were far too hot. We are now about 100m down the road at
                "Ganesh Amed". We got put into a different room to the one we had booked and
                have one of the best balconies we have ever had. We are overlooking the sea to
                the front and also have views of Agung to the side.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. I felt quite rough and tired from
                last night and have also started taking Amoxicillin for the sting or bite which
                looks infected on my leg. I don't know what caused it but I noticed it on
                Wednesday and it has been getting gradually more red, painful and hot ever
                since.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We are not sure if we have the correct antibiotics for such things but they are
                the only ones we have and it is four more days before I get the chance to see a
                doctor or pharmacist. On a more positive note, the stomach bug that I have had
                for the last week seems to have finally cleared up.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent most of the afternoon sleeping in the room or on the balcony. We walked
                along to Eco Dive in the evening to book diving for tomorrow. We have dived with
                them a couple of times before and they are very cheap for unguided dives. We ate
                back in the hotel restaurant and I was asleep again by 9:00.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st May
                </span>Woke up feeling a lot better than yesterday. The bite is slightly less
                painful so hopefully the antibiotics are working. We had breakfast, collected
                all our dive gear and carried it down to Eco Dive. Everything there seemed a bit
                disorganised but by about 9:00 we were on the boat heading out to Bunutan, the
                first site of the day. When we dived here last, there were strong currents and
                loads of activity down at about 30m. Today, there was a lot less current and not
                as much action. Still an enjoyable dive with plenty of colourful coral in the
                shallows.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour back at the dive centre before going out on the same boat to
                Pyramids which is the site a few hundred metres from where we are staying. This
                was also a good dive despite the currents being different to what we have had
                before here. Previously, this has been a drift dive ending exactly in front of
                our accommodation but this time, we were swimming into slight current and only
                covered about half the distance. We did see three or four pygmy sea-horses and
                quite a few nudibranchs but did not get to the area where we regularly saw a
                turtle last year. Both dives started with huge patches of garden eels.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by about 1:30 and had lunch in the restaurant. Spent
                the rest of the day by the pool or on the balcony. We went out to eat at about
                7:30 and managed to stay awake slightly longer than last night.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PbXrsJYE2ew/UZ8mVotqUWI/AAAAAAAAMSc/9nbLZeXUFBY/s320/IMG_1065.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd May
                </span>A similar day to yesterday .We had talked about some of the other options
                for diving from Jemeluk. Jeff and Dawn had recommended The Japanese Wreck which
                is a beach dive but is a 15 - 20 minute car journey away. There is also a very
                good island about 15 - 20 minutes by boat away from there.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                However, we have never dived these sites before so we would of needed a guide.
                Adding on the cost of the transport as well as the cost of a guide, meant the
                dives would of cost a lot more than the local dives so we did yesterday. We
                decided to do a repeat of these two dives instead.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                There was still no great current at Bunutan but there did seem to be more fish
                around than yesterday. At pyramids, we were hoping to have another go at
                photographing the pygmy sea-horses but we got dropped in a slightly different
                spot and then got distracted by a hawksbill turtle so failed to find the sea fan
                that the sea-horses live on. (The dives today were 77 and 83 minutes which took
                my average time time to over 60 minutes for the first time)</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Another lazy afternoon not doing a lot. We had a few hours by the pool and I
                finally caught up with the editing of all the underwater pictures. We ate just
                about next door to where we are staying and had another early night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                My bite has felt slightly better again today which does imply that the
                antibiotics may be having some effect. However, it seems to be oozing a lot of
                nasty looking pus which is not such good news. We have a couple of days without
                diving now so it should dry out a bit hopefully.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-35lFwoEu-TE/UZ8mZ0TXLZI/AAAAAAAAMSk/OUWekReLEpk/s320/IMG_1097.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 23rd May
                </span>We had decided on a day off diving today so did not have a lot to do. At
                10:30, we wandered along to Eco Dive to pay our bill and collect the gear we had
                left behind yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">As we were about to leave the dive centre, John the owner,
                and one of the instructors, were both quite concerned about the lump on my leg
                which is still oozing pus and looks a bit of a mess. They both seemed to think
                that it needed immediate medical attention and that I should not wait until
                tomorrow as I had planned. About 15 minutes later, I was on the back of a moped
                being driven to Culik. Culik is about five miles away and is the nearest village
                that has a doctor.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                When we arrived at the clinic and found the doctor, he diagnosed an Acute
                Furuncle which is a type of hair follicle infection..... otherwise known as a
                boil. He described it as a small problem, not a big problem. He cleaned it all
                up and gave me something that looks like black vaseline to put on it four times
                a day. He also gave me two sets of tablets to take, although these seemed to be
                randomly selected from a box containing a wide range of pills, and told me it
                should all be better in about three days. I am not totally sure that I share his
                optimism but we will have to wait and see. He charged me Rp470,000 for the
                consultation, cream and tablets which is about £30 so not too bad. My moped
                driver waited for me and took me back to Jemeluk. He charged Rp15,000 which is
                about £1 and seemed better value.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Another afternoon of not doing much and a similar evening to the last couple. We
                ate at the place we ate in a couple of nights ago and were back in the room by
                8:30.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 24th May
                </span>We checked out of Ganesh Amed at midday. We had booked a transfer to the
                airport, the start of a 21 hour journey to Alona Beach in the Philippines. It
                took a couple of hours to get to just outside Kuta and then another hour to go
                the last five miles to the airport. We arrived at the airport just after 3 and
                checked in for the 17:40 Air Asia flight to Singapore. The flight left slightly
                late at 6pm and landed in Changi&nbsp; two and a half hours later. We had almost
                four hours at the airport but this went fairly quickly.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to clear immigration and enter Singapore despite the fact that we were
                only transiting. We collected our luggage and got the sky-train from Terminal 1
                to Terminal 2 and then checked in for the Cebu Pacific flight to Cebu at 00:20 -
                the same flight we had used when we flew to The Philippines last year. Once we
                had checked in, we ate at McDonalds before exiting Singapore again and going to
                wait near the gate. I went into a couple of pharmacists to ask about the drugs I
                had been given for my leg (which still seems to be getting better) and they both
                seemed to think there was no problem or need for anything else. We had fast
                internet for the first time since Surabaya so could upload photos and diary
                while waiting for the flight which left just about on time.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th May
                </span>The flight to Cebu was quite empty so we managed to get three seats each
                at the back of the plane and did manage to get an hour or two's sleep. We landed
                slightly ahead of schedule at 3:45 and were through the airport without any
                problems just after 4:00. We even managed to get money out of the ATM. We had
                arranged a transfer with the dive centre and were met by someone when we came
                through arrivals. He told us that the driver had not turned up but took us by
                taxi to the port about 30 minutes drive away. He left us at the port and we went
                and checked in for the 6am ferry to Tagbilaran on Bohol. The dive centre had
                booked the tickets for us and sent us e-tickets. This all worked fairly smoothly
                and by 5am we had checked in and were sat in the waiting area. The boat left on
                time at 6:00. It was full but reasonably comfortable.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at Tagbilaran and were met by someone else from Philippine Fun Divers
                and he drove us to our hotel at Alona Beach. There is a hotel attached to the
                dive centre and we are in the Annex about two minutes walk behind it. It does
                not really compare to the last two places we have stayed in terms of location
                but it is a nice enough room and we were able to check into it as soon as we
                arrived which was a relief.. We went out and got something to eat for breakfast
                and also called in at the dive centre to book diving for tomorrow. We went back
                to the room for showers and then had a few hours catching up on sleep.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a walk around the shops in the evening and returned to the dive
                centre to fill out the forms for tomorrow. In the evening, we ate at
                Graziella's, an Italian restaurant and had superb pizzas. We were not sure if
                they were really very good or just seemed good after a month in Indonesia where
                the food is not great. Either way, with a few beers, it was a very enjoyable
                meal.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 26th May
                </span>We walked down to the dive centre just before 8:00, left our gear and
                went for breakfast. We went back half an hour later and waited until 9 before
                getting on the boat. There were only two other divers, a couple from
                Singapore/Japan and as soon as they arrived just after 9:00, we departed for
                Balicasag Island. The island is about 45 minutes away and has the best diving in
                the area.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_Cj2H0KlXM/UaRSZUae1DI/AAAAAAAAMt0/R4OamQvwyOU/s320/IMG_2820.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did two dives at Balicasag with a one hour surface interval. The first dive
                at "Royal Garden" was quite good. We spent the first 15 - 20 minutes swimming
                with a big school of jacks. We were swimming into current along the top of a
                wall and I'm not sure if they followed us or if they were going that way anyway
                but it was a good start to the dive. We had been told that we would see plenty
                of turtles and saw two on this dive.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second site at "Sanctuary" was a much better dive. This was a far more
                spectacular wall with really nice hard coral at the top, a giant frog fish, leaf
                scorpion fish and lots of turtles for Roz to chase at the end. We were back at
                our hotel just after 2:00 and after showering, finished off the remains of last
                nights pizzas. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                My boil is a lot better today as the doctor predicted. It had started looking
                better yesterday but my foot and ankle had really swollen up which was slightly
                worrying. Today, the swelling had gone down and the boil also has gone right
                down. There is still the wound where the pus is coming out but it all looks
                loads better than it did and looks as if it will clear up completely in a couple
                of days.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Graziellas to eat and had a very similar evening to yesterday.</p>
