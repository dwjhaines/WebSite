                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 28th January
                </span>Another excellent days diving. We were picked up by the dive boat from in
                front of the villas again at 7:30. We were diving with Liang again and five
                other divers. The first two dives were similar to the ones on Saturday but
                without seeing as many rays sharks or turtles. We still saw a turtle on both
                dives, and on the second, an eagle ray and had a few minutes with a nurse shark
                swimming around us.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                During the surface interval between these two dives, we were talking to one of
                the other customers who told us that they sometimes take the boat up to the
                Northern sites in the afternoon to an area where you can see eagle rays. We
                decided that we should do this at some point and within a few minutes seemed to
                have been booked onto the boat for this afternoon. We were back at the villas by
                about 1:30 and, after a quick lunch, were on our way again less than an hour
                later.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RQuN7boswsA/UQmK9dngCOI/AAAAAAAAJLI/NVUd5muntUU/s320/IMG_7118.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive was the best of the day. We dropped in on top of a wall at about
                24m in quite strong current. Quite early on in the dive we saw a large school of
                eagle rays on the sand quite a way away from us. Once these left, we clung onto
                rocks at 24m waiting for them to swim along the wall.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The biggest group came along just as I was down to 4
                minutes of deco time. We watched them swimming past before starting to ascend
                and immediately saw another group swimming behind them. These probably
                looked even more spectacular as we were viewing them from above. In total, we
                must of seen 40 - 50 of them making the dive well worth doing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Again, we had a couple of drinks while doing our log books in the evening and
                walked into town to eat at the same restaurant for the third day running.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 29th January
                </span>Two more dives today. Not quite as good as some of the other dives we
                have done here but still pretty good. We were diving today with Ernesto and
                three other divers. The first dive was at Punta Sur, Sur. The first half of this
                dive was excellent with plenty more eagle rays swimming around the pinnacles and
                once again, very spectacular scenery. The second half was mainly over sand and
                got a bit boring after a while. The second dive was at San Francisco Wall. This
                dive was not as spectacular as some we have done here but we did see two
                turtles, the first of which was one of the smallest we have ever seen
                underwater.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had hoped to be back early today as Sunderland v Swansea was being shown live
                on Mexican TV at 1:45pm. It looked as if this would not be a problem at one
                stage but just before we got into the water for the second dive, one of the
                other divers had a problem with his computer and I got a leak in my high
                pressure hose. It took about 15 minutes to get both of these sorted out and we
                then did a 96 minute dive - the second longest we have ever done! We got back to
                the room by about 2:15 so missed the first 30 minutes of the game. The game was
                a fairly unexciting 0 - 0 draw and was over by 3:45.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                I cycled into San Miguel straight after the game and bought a new high pressure
                hose (US$31). I took it back to the villas and spent about 45 minutes replacing
                the old one before discovering that there was a small part missing from the
                connector on the one I had bought. I had to cycle back into town again to buy
                the additional part (which probably should of been included with the new hose)
                and by the time I had completed the repair, it was gone 6:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks while doing our log books and then walked into town
                and went for a pizza for a change.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WdTQVL4LWn4/URA6F9KKrmI/AAAAAAAAJLo/uWD2gsfzdsQ/s320/IMG_7143.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 30th January
                </span>Our final two dives in Cozumel today. A couple of people on the boat were
                keen to go to the Northern Cozumel sites which we had not been to before. One of
                them Todd, was the one who had recommended the eagle ray dive the other day so
                we said we did not mind. Both dives were OK again but in our opinion, no-where
                near as good as the Southern sites. The first site, Barracuda Reef is known as
                being the most challenging of the Cozumel sites. It was quite a nice wall but
                had very strong currents.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The big steel tanks they use here enable longer dives but make buoyancy control
                a lot harder. Trying to battle against down-currents while being forced away
                from the reef at 28m was not the most enjoyable of experiences! It was the
                closest I have been to panicking in a long time. Everyone on the dive got
                through their air quicker than usual and it was a relatively short dive of only
                58 minutes.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive at San Juan Reef was better - still strong currents but they
                were a lot more manageable and it was a slightly more relaxed dive. We saw
                turtles on both dives and they were still good dives, just not what we would of
                chosen for our last dives here.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back earlier today as the Northern sites are closer and the first dive
                was under an hour. We had last nights left-overs for lunch and did not do much
                for the rest of the day. We had a couple of drinks before walking into town to
                eat and a couple more when we got back but were still reasonably sober when we
                went to bed at about 11.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 31st January
                </span>We did not have too much to do today. Unfortunately, it was probably the
                worst days weather we have had since arriving in Mexico so lying in the sun was
                not an option. We got a few things sorted out in the morning for later in the
                trip and finally managed to cancel our original flight out of Mexico (we have
                booked a new one because of the football and have had a few problems cancelling
                the original). We also looked into options for our one week in Florida and found
                a dive centre that looks reasonable for a few days. At about midday there was a
                break in the rain so we cycled into town.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J3BBfyVS5G8/URA5_q7e5PI/AAAAAAAAJLc/3QdZ55qAZEU/s320/IMG_0104.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to pay our bill at the dive shop and spent a while wandering round trying
                to get cash out. We thought we would have to pay in US$ which caused us a few
                problems (the only proper US$ ATM was not working). The shop eventually gave us
                a decent rate for using pesos so we were able to get pesos out and pay in cash.
                We went round a few of the souvenir shops and then cycled out to Mega
                supermarket to buy stuff for lunch. When we came out of there, it was pouring
                with rain again. We waited until it had eased a bit but still got completely
                soaked cycling back to the villas. Finally had lunch at about 3pm.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch we booked our accommodation in Key Largo for the last three nights
                of our stay in Florida in March. We could make free phone calls to the states
                from our room so it was a good time to get this sorted out.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a similar evening to yesterday. We had a few drinks before walking into
                town and eating in Parrilla Mission for the last time. We walked back to the
                villas, had a couple more drinks and were in bed by about 11.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 1st February
                </span>We were up by 7:30. We had breakfast outside our room, finished packing
                all our gear and were given a lift to the ferry terminal by Brent at about 8:40.
                We caught the 9:00 ferry back to Playa del Carmen. The crossing was a lot
                rougher than it was when we arrived in Cozumel due to the bad weather. There was
                lots of people being sea-sick and Roz came very close to joining them. We
                arrived in Playa at 9:45 in torrential rain so were soaked again by the time we
                got to the bus station. We just missed getting the 10:00 bus but got tickets for
                the one at 10:30. We were at Cancun airport by 11:30.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked in for our flight to Havana without any problems having bought our
                Cuban visas from Cubana Airlines. The 50 minute flight was on time and we landed
                in Havana just after 4pm local time (one hour ahead of Mexico. Everything at the
                airport went reasonably smoothly. We got through immigration, collected our
                luggage after a bit of a wait and managed to get money out of an ATM before
                getting a taxi to our hotel. We were at the hotel by 6ish and were relieved to
                find they did have our reservation after the problems we had with the agency.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The hotel is a big colonial style building just on the outskirts of the old town
                with a very spectacular entrance and reception area. We are on the sixth floor
                which Al Capone once hired out apparently! After having showers we went out to a
                few local bars. We did not want to go to far as we do not know our way round yet
                but there were a couple of places within 100m or so that are recommended in
                Lonely Planet. Rum is very cheap here (a bottle costs about £2) so we had plenty
                of mojitos and Cuba Libres and neither of us remember getting back to the hotel.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MiImk5mLv7k/URA6ALqWoTI/AAAAAAAAJLY/GypC5BMkwGo/s320/IMG_0139.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 2nd February
                </span>We had breakfast in the hotel and then returned to the room to watch West
                Ham v Swansea. We have no internet access here but were able to watch the game
                live on a Mexican TV channel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Once this had finished, we went out and spent a few hours sight-seeing. This
                mainly involved walking round the old town looking at the buildings and squares
                as well as getting plenty of photos of the old American cars that are everywhere
                (and are one of the highlights of wandering round the town).We saw the Capitol
                Building which is very close to where we are staying and then walked round the
                four main squares.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After an hour or so back in the hotel, we went out for the evening. We walked
                back to the old town and went for a beer in a beer hall type place on Plaza
                Vieja. This was an excellent place to drink but had terrible service. We left
                after a couple in there and went to one other bar that Lonely Planet had
                recommended. This was quite expensive by local standards so we walked back to
                two of the bars that we were in last night. We discovered that rum and coke cost
                half as much as Cuba libres so had a few of these before getting back to the
                hotel at about 11:00.</p>

                </span>
                A similar day to yesterday. We continued with our sight-seeing when we got up
                (at about midday). We did the walking tour from our guide book and then walked
                along the Malecón, the walkway along the sea-front, as far as the National Hotel
                - one of Havana's most famous sights. The hotel was impressive but a lot of the
                tour was not as interesting as walking around the old town yesterday.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few hours back in our hotel and walked back into the old town in the
                evening. We returned to the beer hall and spent an hour or so sat there looking
                at the Plaza Vieja (the service was slightly better tonight!). We had a meal at
                a pizza restaurant and walked back to the hotel to finish a bottle of run that
                we had bought when we arrived. We got to bed by about 10:30 in a slightly more
                sober state than on the previous two nights.</p>
