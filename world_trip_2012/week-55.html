                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 10th June
                </span>We did not have a lot to do today before our 8:30 flight to Tawau in the
                evening. We spent the morning sleeping or using the Wi-Fi in the hotel reception
                before checking out at 1:00. The weather was not sunny today but it was warm
                enough to spend the rest of the afternoon reading by the pool. We left the pool
                to go out for lunch and to get a couple of things we needed but apart from that
                stayed there until 5ish. At 6:30, we got a taxi back to the airport and checked
                in for our Air Asia flight.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight left roughly on time and took just over half an hour to get to Tawau.
                At Tawau we were met by two minibuses from Scuba Junkie for us and ten Chinese
                customers. We were driven to Semporna and arrived at the Scuba Junkie Backpacker
                resort at around 11:00. We went out to eat at a local restaurant (roti canai for
                the third time today) and got to bed just before midnight.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 11th June
                </span>We were up by about 6:30 to get our gear ready. We had breakfast just
                after 7:00 before heading over the road to fill out the forms, etc. We carried
                our stuff down to the pier and eventually left just after 8:30. There were a
                couple of cancelations today so the only other divers on the boat were four
                Danish girls on the final day of their open water course. We were led by Nic and
                also had her boyfriend, Gavin along with us.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip today was out to Mantabuan Island for three dives. The dives were all
                pretty good. There was some confusion at the start of the second - we were
                waiting around for a while due to one of the girls having ear problems and ended
                up repeating the first dive site - but each of the dives was still over 60
                minutes so we could not complain.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We saw plenty of turtles on the third dive (14 in total today) and also found a
                sleeping sea-snake. Got back to Semporna at about 5:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After showering we had the first of what could be quite a lot of walks to the
                cash-point machine which seemed to limit how much we can take out each day. We
                went out and ate at the Indian restaurant a few doors away and were back in the
                room just after 8:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 12th June
                </span>A similar day to yesterday. The trip today was to Mataking Island, just
                over an hours boat journey from Semporna. We did three dives again, all of which
                were very good. We dived the Mataking Post wreck, the Mataking house reef and
                "Sweet-lips Table" on another near-by island. There were about the same number
                of people on the boat as yesterday and we were diving on our own with Nic again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The wreck is only a small boat but we spent about 30 minutes swimming around it
                before swimming along the reef. We saw three turtles including several sightings
                of a large green turtle as it kept returning to a cleaning station. We did not
                see anything particularly spectacular on the second dive but it was a very nice
                site with lots of coral and plenty of fish. The third dive was the best of the
                day. Roz counted nineteen turtles and also found a frog fish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Another similar evening as well - back at the backpackers by about 5:30,
                cash-point, supermarket, showers, Indian restaurant, back in the room again just
                after 8:00.</p>

                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1uGx9rtGqPo/Ubu5XVwa8EI/AAAAAAAANoE/vx1Htek74bQ/s320/IMG_2152.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th June
                </span>Three dives at Sibuan Island today. We were diving with Nic again and
                also had Victor in our group. Victor only had 15 dives but was pretty good
                underwater and was fine to dive with. Also on the boat were three OW and one AOW
                students as well as 3 DSD's.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The first site' "Left Shoulder" was not wonderful and seemed to cater more to
                the students and DSD's than to us. There was not too much to see and a lot of
                the time was spent on shallow sandy areas. We did see a frog fish towards the
                end of the dive however.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive was at "Right Shoulder". Although the starting point was the
                same, this was a much better dive swimming in the opposite direction from where
                we went in. We only saw one turtle but it was a hawksbill and was with us for 25
                - 30 minutes of the dive which was probably the highlight of the days diving.
                The third dive was at Hawksbill Highway. Despite the name of the site, we only
                saw one hawksbill and one other turtle but it was a nice enough dive again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The evening was the same as yesterday.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 14th June
                </span>Three more dives at Mantabuan today. We were diving on our own with Nas
                today, a Malaysian guide who we know from previous visits here. Victor was on
                the boat again but he was diving with Marie, the only other diver on the trip.
                There were also five snorkelers with us. The first dive of the day was at Black
                Coral Gardens and was fairly similar to the ones we did at Same Same three days
                ago.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second was at "Corner" and was a better dive. The coral was very spectacular
                particularly above 10m. The third dive at "Channel" was the best of the three.
                There was loads of macro stuff at the start of the dive - frog fish, pipe fish,
                nudis, etc - and then more nice coral and a few turtles towards the end.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in Semporna slightly earlier today. We went into the dive shop to
                look at tomorrows schedule and found that there is no trip to the Northern
                Islands i.e. where we have been diving the last four days. We were on the board
                to go on a day trip to Mabul but as we are going to Mabul for nine days next
                Monday, this seemed a bit pointless. There were no alternatives to this so we
                got our names removed. This was a bit disappointing initially but it will not
                work out too badly as we are moving to a nicer hotel tomorrow anyway and a
                couple of days off diving before we head out to Mabul will not do us any harm.
                We will be diving for 10 consecutive days when we get there so still have plenty
                of diving left before we go home.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Apart from that is was our usual evening routine of cash-point, showers, Indian
                restaurant and back to the room for log-books, photo editing, etc.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th June
                </span>We checked out of the backpackers at 10:00 and carried our stuff to The
                Seafest Hotel, about five minutes walk away. We had to wait about 20 minutes
                before our room was ready and then spent an hour or so by the pool although it
                was not particularly sunny. We walked back into Semporna for lunch. We ate at
                our usual Indian restaurant and had another trip to the cash-point and the
                supermarket. We also called into Scuba Junkie and found that our names were down
                for a trip to Sibuan tomorrow. We had planned to get drunk tonight and spend
                tomorrow not doing anything but decided we may as well go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks in the evening anyway. We had a couple of beers in the room
                before walking back to the Scuba Junkie bar/restaurant for a change from Indian
                food. The food in there is recommended by all the staff and was very good. We
                had a couple of beers with our food and then walked back to the hotel where we
                got through a bottle and a half of our Philippine rum. It was still a relatively
                early night and we were asleep by 11:00.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 16th June
                </span>We left for the dive centre at about 7:30 stopping for roti canai for
                breakfast on the way. We were diving on our own with Nas again today. There were
                two other fun divers on the boat and six open water students with two
                instructors. The first dive was at Left Shoulder again. This was a better dive
                than when we did it three days ago as we mainly managed to stay out of the area
                where everyone was doing their confined skills. We saw another frog fish, an
                octopus and a sea-moth in the shallows at the end of the dive.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-91rVl9yJ0cU/UcvXy12-ooI/AAAAAAAAN3w/Z1EUPcwSPd0/s320/IMG_4420.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Before the second dive, Nas was talking to a guide from another boat who told
                him about some pygmy sea-horses at "Drop-off". Nas was keen to go and see them
                so the three of us got on the other boat and went down to 24 metres to have a
                look. It was quite entertaining to see all nine of the other (mainly Chinese)
                divers from the other boat trying to look at the two sea-horses at the same
                time. We waited for them to move out of the way before moving in to get our
                photos. The rest of the dive was pretty good along a steep wall. We were back on
                the correct boat for dive three at Mandarin Point. This was also pretty good
                with another three turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went straight back to the hotel once we had washed our gear. We went back
                into Semporna to eat at our usual restaurant (roti canai again), bought a couple
                of things from the supermarket and were back at the hotel just after 8:00.</p>
