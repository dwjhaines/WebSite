                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 17th June
                </span>We checked out of The Seafest at 7:15 and walked to Scuba Junkie. We left
                our luggage there while we went for breakfast - our final roti canai for a week
                or so. Our boat to Mabul left at 8:00. There were five other customers on it so
                it was fairly empty. We got to Mabul an hour later and off loaded our luggage.
                We were joined on the boat by more divers making twelve customers with three
                guides. We left straight away for the first dive of the day at "Black Ray
                Channel". We were diving with Claudia and had three other divers with us for the
                first dive. There was a lot of messing about at the start of the dive due to
                problems with one of our group's regulators so it took a bit of time to get
                down. Once down, the dive was OK without being anything too exciting. We did not
                see any turtles which was a bit of a surprise as we had seen about ten when we
                dived here last..</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M4X26dwkU_Q/UcvVvKcnuvI/AAAAAAAAN3Q/oSQpHfZyUxk/s320/IMG_2367.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were able to check in to our room in between the first and second dives. We
                are back in room 12 for the next nine nights - the same room we have stayed in
                for the last two years. This is the room closest to the beach and is the best
                one they have in our price range.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went off for the second dive at 12:30 at "Sea
                Ventures". This is a dive underneath the oil rig a few hundred metres from the
                beach in front of the resort. This was a better dive than the last time we were
                here as there was no current. Although this is mainly a muck dive, the highlight
                was probably the large schools of bat fish as we were coming up from the bottom
                and during the safety stop.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive of the day after lunch was at Nudi Nook and was probably the
                best. We saw a few nudis and finally started seeing turtles. There were none on
                the first two dives but Roz counted six on this dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the resort by 4ish. Did not do a lot for the rest of&nbsp; the
                afternoon. Rowan did another of his shark presentations in the evening. It was
                fairly similar to the one we had been to two years ago. I stayed until just
                after 9:00 and then left to sort out cameras for tomorrow.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 18th June
                </span>The main reason to come to this part of Malaysia and the reason we have
                chosen to end our trip here is the diving at Sipadan. We have four days diving
                booked there and today was the first of the our four days. We were up at 5:45,
                had a quick breakfast and were on the jetty by 6:15.&nbsp; Scuba Junkie get
                seven permits a day for Sipadan so, as usual there were nine people on the boat.
                The two guides today were Dave, who we have dived with before and Max. \We met
                Max two years ago and did a lot of fun dives with his brother, Leo. Also on the
                boat were Sofia (who was a DMT here last year), her father and three others. We
                were diving with Dave, Sofia and her father although we spent most of the dives
                as one big group.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9El6kAXaauo/UcvVjYzZeaI/AAAAAAAAN3I/4SlmsxPK56o/s320/IMG_2460.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first dive was at Barracuda Point. This is rated as one of the best dive
                sites in the world and within minutes of getting in the water we were surrounded
                by the huge school of jacks with sharks swimming along the top of the reef. We
                found the big school of barracuda and although there were not many turtles
                about, we did see a few including one hawksbill swimming through the barracuda.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive was at South Point where we counted 23 sharks and 12 green
                turtles. Dive three was at Drop-off. At the start of this dive we went further
                into the turtle cave than we have ever been before although we still did not
                make it into the main part of the cave. After exiting the cave, we swam back
                round to Barracuda Point.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The last dive of the day was at Hanging Garden. We spent about 20 minutes in the
                blue looking for hammer-heads without success and the rest of the dive in the
                shallows looking for turtles. The turtles proved easier to spot with Roz
                counting sixteen in total. A good end to an excellent days diving.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back on Mabul before 4:00. Before the evening meal, we went for a drink
                at Sipadan Water Village, the next resort along from us in the hope that we
                would be able to use their Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi at Scuba Junkie has not worked since
                we got here. It was a nice enough bar but they only give out their password to
                residents. After eating, we had a drink in the scuba junkie bar and a couple
                more drinks on our balcony. Got to bed at around 10:30.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 19th June
                </span>The diving was OK today but not great, particularly after yesterday. We
                did two dives out on what they now call The Sipadan Barrier Reef. Both these
                sites are good for macro stuff. We saw a few things - leaf scorpion fish, ribbon
                eels, stone fish - but nothing too exciting. Before the second dive, we saw
                turtles mating&nbsp; on the surface. The snorkelers on the boat saw this quite
                close up but by the time we had got our gear on and jumped into the water, they
                had disappeared.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive after lunch was back on Mabul. A whale shark had been spotted at
                Stingray City during the morning so we dived there in the hope that it would
                still be around. It was a nice enough dive but no sign of the whale shark. We
                did see our first underwater turtles of the day as we were finishing our safety
                stop. By the time we were back from the third dive, Roz was not feeling well.
                She had not been 100% before the dive and was worse by the time we were back at
                the jetty. She went to bed directly after we had washed our equipment and stayed
                there all evening.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                I ate tea with Sabine and Dorin from Switzerland. We dived with them on our
                first day here and will be at Sipadan with them tomorrow. Did not do much for
                the rest of the evening apart from editing a few photos.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qBp-ITmd4WA/UcvYGDUhozI/AAAAAAAAN4A/wStQa9pudhg/s320/IMG_4828.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 20th June
                </span>Another excellent days diving at Sipadan today. Roz woke up still not
                feeling 100% but was well enough to dive which was good news. We were diving
                with Khai today as well as Sabine and Dorin. Also on the boat were three Swedish
                blokes diving with Stu. We did the same dive sites that we did two days ago but
                in a different order. We still did Barracuda Point first and as before, the
                first 10 - 15 minutes of the dive were superb. It was very similar to two days
                ago but we also saw 30 - 40 bump-heads.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did Hanging Garden for the second dive. This was at low tide which is ideal
                conditions for seeing turtles. On this dive, Roz counted 47 which we are fairly
                sure is a record for us. Dive three was at Drop-of and once again, we went from
                there round to Barracuda Point. Four more turtles, fourteen more sharks.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Last dive of the day was at South Point. There were mating turtles at the
                surface and I did see them briefly when we got in the water. We saw two other
                couples attempting to mate during the dive, twelve turtles in total and another
                23 sharks.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Did not do too much else for the rest of the day after we got back. We had
                planned to have a few drinks but Roz was still not feeling well enough for
                alcohol. We ate with Sabine and Dorin again and were back in the room by 9:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st June
                </span>First two dives today were at Ligatan, about 50 minutes from Mabul along
                the Sipadan Barrier Reef. There is the chance to see bigger rays here and it is
                another area that Scuba Junkie have only recently started taking customers to.
                We were diving with Dave again together with a French couple and there were five
                other Asian customers on the boat.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The dives were both quite similar. Most of the time was spent in the blue
                looking for rays and we only came back to the reef towards the end of the dive.
                We only saw one eagle ray on the two dives but there were turtles everywhere! We
                saw 31 on the first dive and Roz counted 11 looking down while we waited in the
                water to be picked up. She counted another 34 on the second dive making 76 in
                total - more than we had seen in four dives at Sipadan yesterday.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back on Mabul for lunch and then dived Awas on our own with Dave. This
                was an excellent 95 minute dive. There was loads to see - 2 sea-horses, 3 frog
                fish, 2 ornate ghost pipe fish, snake eels, pipe fish, flying gurnard, file
                fish, etc...... and of course another 10 turtles! Back on the pier, we said
                goodbye to Sabine and Dorin who were leaving on the 4:30 boat back to Mabul and
                also to Victor who was diving here today and who we will not see again.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a beer at the Borneo Divers bar before eating and then went up to
                the bar for a couple with Dave after our meal. Back in the room by just after
                9:00, totally worn out. Roz has now 100% recovered from whatever it is that she
                had but I seem to have caught a cold.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 22nd June
                </span>Our third trip to Sipadan today. We were diving with Dave again today and
                had two others in our group - Jason (or Justin) from America and Sylvia from
                Australia. Lydia was the other guide diving with Justin (or Jason), Jill and
                Terry. It was a very similar trip to the previous ones. We did the same four
                dive sites but in a different order again. South Point was first followed by
                Barracuda Point, Drop-off and Hanging Gardens. All the dives were excellent with
                sharks and turtles at all four sites. There were a lot more bump-heads at
                Barracuda Point which was as good as it always is. The total number of turtles
                from all four dives came to exactly 100 - another new record.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks in the evening. The Lions were playing Australia at 6pm and
                it was shown live in the Scuba Junkie bar. We had a few drinks in there watching
                the game and then a few more drinks on our balcony. Got to bed by about 10:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 23rd June
                </span>Another day trip today, this time a three dive trip to Siamil. We were
                diving with Dave again and two others. There were about ten divers on the boat
                in total. The dives were all pretty good without being two spectacular. There is
                more macro stuff to look at on Siamil, particularly on the third dive at First
                beach. During the day we saw two frog fish, two stone fish, two sea moths, lots
                of pipe fish, fingered dragonet, nudis, etc.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz's high pressure hose had started leaking during the first dive. It was OK
                for the second and third but needs replacing. We managed to get a new hose from
                Rowan when we got back to the jetty and will try and get it changed before the
                first dive tomorrow. We were both worn out again by the time we got back and
                were asleep within an hour or so of finishing the evening meal.</p>
