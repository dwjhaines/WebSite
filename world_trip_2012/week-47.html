                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 15th April
                </span>We did two dives today with Master Divers, a dive centre owned by a
                couple we had met while diving in Pulau Weh six years ago. We did not need to be
                at the dive centre until 11:45 so had the morning to ourselves. Once again, the
                weather was poor so we did not do a lot except laze around in the room or on the
                balcony.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L_QtMNfb1nw/UXAFVYKSOzI/AAAAAAAALAg/LCLrnXgBvgI/s320/IMG_8593.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the dive centre, we sorted out our gear and were taken by long-tail boat to
                the Master Divers dive boat. We were diving with Mayumi, a Japanese instructor
                who hardly spoke English and Sarah, an English instructor. There were only two
                other divers on the boat, both students. The dives at Green Rock and White Rock
                were both OK.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had quite low expectations of the diving here but they were both enjoyable
                enough dives. The visibility was not great but there was plenty of fish on both
                dives and just about enough to make the dives interesting. Both dives were just
                over an hour.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the dive centre by 4 and after a bit of a chat with Ayesha, we
                walked back to the room. We went out to eat in the evening at Bam-Bam, somewhere
                we had not eaten before but that was recommended by Ayesha. Here, we had
                probably the best food we have had since arriving in Thailand. We ate quite
                early as we had missed lunch and were back in the room again by 8:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 16th April
                </span>A similar day to yesterday with two afternoon dives. We went to Red Rock
                and White Rock today. We dived with Mayumi again today. We also had Dan and one
                other diver along with us for both dives (not really sure what they were doing)
                and Ayesha joined us on the first. Both dives were quite good again and we saw a
                turtle on the second. This was not quite the same sort of turtle experience that
                we were having in Bonaire! As soon as I banged my tank when I spotted the
                turtle, another big group of divers appeared and we moved on after a couple of
                minutes. We also saw one of the biggest sea-snakes we have ever seen and a
                juvenile harlequin sweet-lips.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the room slightly later (we had longer dives today), ate out at
                Bam-Bam Restaurant again and were back in the room by 8:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">
                    Wednesday, 17th April
                </span>Our final two dives here today. We had an earlier start today as we were
                on the morning boat and had to be at the dive centre by 7:00. When we woke at
                6ish, there was another storm outside. Dark clouds, thunder and lightning and
                more heavy rain made the thought of going diving particularly unappealing. The
                rain had eased a bit by the time we walked to the dive centre but we did not see
                the sun all day again.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-quwmIU6EM3Y/UXAE_M1bPAI/AAAAAAAALAY/1Li6LzAugos/s320/IMG_8649.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once again, we were diving with Mayumi but with no other divers in our group
                today. The first dive of the day was at the HTMS Sattakut wreck. This was a WWII
                ship in pretty good condition - it had been sunk deliberately for divers a
                couple of years ago. The conditions on the surface were a bit rough but once
                underwater, vis was fine and the wreck was quite enjoyable. We only stayed on
                the wreck about 15 minutes before moving to the nearby, and shallower site, Hin
                Pee Wee. As with the other sites here, this was all OK without anything too
                spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Potteries and was probably the
                worst of the sites we had been to. Max depth of 10m and not a lot to see.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The early start meant that we were back at Ananda by midday. We had lunch on the
                balcony and spent the afternoon reading or sitting on the balcony again. We went
                for a walk around a couple of dive shops at 4ish as I need a new mask. After
                just over 12 years, mine has started leaking regularly and needs replacing. We
                looked at a couple of different options and returned to the room to look at
                reviews on the internet before making a decision. We went to eat at Bam-Bam
                again in the evening and had another early night.</p>

                    Thursday, 18th April
                </span>Had a day of not doing much today. We had only booked three days diving
                here and although it was enjoyable, three days was probably about right. We had
                breakfast at Mae Haad Seafood. The weather had improved by this morning and for
                the first time since we got to Thailand we had blue skies and sunshine.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour or so on the beach just in front of our hotel in the morning.
                At lunchtime, we went out and purchased my new mask (which will be a birthday
                present) and bought tickets for tomorrow morning's ferry back to Samui. We
                bought baguettes for lunch and ate them on the balcony.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent most of the afternoon reading in the room. We had another walk around Mae
                Haad at 5ish before watching the sunset on the beach. We went out to Bam-Bam
                Restaurant for a final time in the evening. The food there has been excellent
                the last few days and very cheap compared to some places we have been in
                Thailand.</p>

                    Friday, 19th April
                </span>We had breakfast at Mae Haad Seafood again before walking back to Ananda,
                packing and checking out. We left just after 9:00 and walked round the corner to
                where the Seatran Discovery ferries leave from. We got straight onto the ferry
                which left on time at 9:30. It was an uneventful two hour journey back to Bank
                Rak on Samui.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have any accommodation booked for tonight.
                There did not seem any point in getting a taxi back to where we stayed last week
                so walked down the road to Samui Mermaid Resort. We got an air-con room here for
                Baht1000. It is only round the corner from the airport and they provide free
                transfers so it seemed a better deal all round.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch in the restaurant just over the road from where we are staying and
                then spent a couple of hours by the pool, mainly in the shade due to burning
                yesterday. In the evening we walked along to the 15m high "Big Buddha" statue
                which is less than a mile from where we are staying. We have been here before
                years ago but it was good to see it again as the sun set behind it. We
                walked back to the resort, had showers and went out to eat over the road in the
                same place we had eaten lunch.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 20th April
                </span>We had breakfast in the restaurant over the road - the third meal in a
                row here. Spent the morning sitting around in the room or on the balcony before
                checking out at midday. We were not due to fly until 5:30 so spent a few hours
                by the pool before we were transferred to the airport at 3:30. We checked in for
                the Phuket flight and had an hour or so sat at the gate before departure. We
                were called to board at about 5:00 and the half full flight took off slightly
                early at 5:25.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were expecting to land at Phuket at 6:30 but we were on the ground by 6:00
                and were outside the airport with our luggage by 6:15. At 6:30 we met up with
                Marco, the boat leader who we knew from previous live-aboards with DiveRace. We
                had to wait about 15 minutes for three other customers (they were not expecting
                us until 6:45 so had gone to the bar) before we all headed North in the mini-bus
                to the pier at Khao Lak. We got on the boat just after 8:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                West Coast had replaced the boat since the last time we dived with them. The new
                boat, Pawara is a lot bigger than the old one. There were 19 divers in total
                plus six guides, including Brian who we also knew from previous trips. We were
                given a boat briefing by Marco and were introduced to the rest of the crew
                before eating at 9:00. We stayed up and talked to some of the other guests while
                following the football and went to bed when that finished at 11:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 21st April
                </span>We were up at 7:00 for "breakfast 1" before getting the long dive
                briefing from Marco. We were put into a group led by Tristan, with Tom and
                Lauren, an American couple. They have a lot less experience than us (they are
                open water divers with about 30 dives) but they are the only other couple on the
                boat diving on Nitrox. The day dives today were all in The Simlians at Anita's
                Reef, West of Eden and Elephant Head.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                All three dives were excellent. There seems to be a lot more fish around than on
                our last few trips to the Similans and the visibility was superb - certainly a
                lot better than in Koh Tao and a lot better than it has been here the last
                couple of weeks apparently. During the day we saw a white-tip reef shark, a
                ghost pipe fish, sea moths, a ribbon eel and large numbers of reef fish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did a night dive (the only one of this trip!!!) at Turtle Rock which was also
                OK. On this dive we saw a cuttle fish and a flying gurnard which is a lot more
                than we have seen on some night dives here.</p>
