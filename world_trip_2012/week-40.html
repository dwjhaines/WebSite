                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 25th February
                </span>We cooked breakfast again before checking out of the apartment at 9:45.
                We all got the tube back to Paddington where we said goodbye to Cathy and got
                another train back to Heathrow. We checked in without any problems and went
                through to the American Airlines lounge. We boarded at 12:45 and the plane left
                on time at 1:15. We had a couple of drinks on the plane and managed to get some
                sleep after lunch. The flight was quite empty so Roz was able to lie down on the
                middle seats and slept for a lot of the eight hour flight. I slept for an hour
                or so and spent a lot of the flight reading the previews and reports from
                yesterday.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Chicago at 4ish local time, slightly earlier than scheduled. We
                had to clear US customs here. It did not take long for us to get to the front of
                the queue but there appeared to be something that the immigration official was
                not happy with. We did not know if it was the fact that we were entering the US
                for the second time in four days but we got taken off to a waiting room and told
                to sit down. After about five minutes I was called into an interview room and
                had to explain again what we were doing, how long we were staying, etc. The
                official there did not tell me what was wrong but eventually stamped our
                passports and let us in.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to change terminals and go through security again for our connecting
                flight back. We had time to have a couple of drinks in the lounge again before
                grabbing a burger from McDonalds and boarding the 6:30 flight to Fort
                Lauderdale. This was also empty - only 25 passengers in economy - so once again,
                we could spread out for three hours.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Fort Lauderdale at 10:30. We had no luggage to collect and no more
                security checks so were through the airport by 10:45. We phoned for the free
                shuttle again and were collected within 15 minutes. By 11:30 we had checked in,
                picked up the bags we had left here three days ago and were in our room. We both
                had showers and were asleep before midnight.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-c5oL_5awq1Q/US69yMituvI/AAAAAAAAKEc/P47yW1C9AOM/s320/IMG_7578.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th February
                </span>We were up for breakfast by 8 and both felt pretty healthy considering
                the lack of sleep and amount of alcohol consumed over the last few days. Did not
                do a lot all morning other than wash all our clothes in the hotel laundry.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At mid-day, we got the shuttle bus back to the airport and collected our hire
                car from Alamo. This was all reasonably straightforward and by 12:30 we were on
                our way out of the airport. We have a Toyota Yaris which is a bit smaller than
                our last car but will be fine for the week we are here.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had not planned to do anything today as we were not sure how hung-over and
                tired we would be. As we were both feeling OK, we decided to drive down to Miami
                Beach, about 25 miles away. There was a huge difference between the driving here
                and in Mexico. Within a couple of minutes of leaving the airport, we were
                heading South on a six lane highway, packed with traffic. We found our way to
                South Beach without any problems and spent about ninety minutes walking along
                Ocean Drive and Lincoln Road. Ocean Road (not surprisingly) runs along the sea
                front and Lincoln Road is a pedestrianised area full of&nbsp; shops and
                restaurants. It was all nice enough with plenty of 50's style, restored, art
                deco buildings but after 90 minutes we had seen everything we wanted to see. We
                returned to the car and drove back to Fort Lauderdale.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As with a lot of places we have stayed in America, there is not a huge range of
                options to eat within walking distance of the hotel. We decided to drive and get
                a takeaway pizza from Papa John's and took it back to eat in the room.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th February
                </span>After breakfast, we checked out of the hotel and loaded up the car. This
                was not that easy to do! The car is a lot smaller than the one in Mexico which
                could take our two big bags easily. We had to take out a lot of the diving gear
                and place it in the spare wheel compartment so that my stuff could be squeezed
                in around Roz's rucksack.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NZq-xDdpdi8/US69zKwaEsI/AAAAAAAAKEo/63jhP_KBSwQ/s320/IMG_0500.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Fort Lauderdale at about 9:30 and drove out towards the Everglades. We
                had to go round Miami which was very busy again but the roads were a lot less
                full once we started heading West. We were in the Shark Valley National Park by
                about 11:00. This is one of the closest parts of The Everglades to Miami and has
                a 15 mile cycle route running through it. Just as we were getting out of the
                car, it started raining. We decided to go for it anyway and went to hire the
                bikes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Cycling through the park was excellent. We had been warned not to go within 5m
                of any alligators but we did not really expect to be that close to&nbsp; them
                anyway. However, we saw almost 30 of them as we cycled round, some of them
                within 2 - 3m of where we were stood. They were in shallow water just beside the
                cycle path and did not seem bothered by us being close to them. There were loads
                of birds to see as well as we cycled round but the alligators were the definite
                highlight.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather was dry for about half of the time we cycled round but we had heavy
                rain for a lot of it. We were wearing shorts and t-shirts so got literally
                soaked to the skin. We probably would of seen more but the last four or five
                miles was a bit of a dash to get back to the visitor centre. We got back in just
                under two hours, returned our bikes and then tried to get everything dry. As
                well as our clothes being completely soaked, we had carried all our valuables
                with us and our bags had also got very wet. We changed into dry clothes and
                spread out as many of our belongings as we could around the car to try and get
                them dry.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NB5OHLPi9SM/US69yE2Ee6I/AAAAAAAAKEY/nldWWu9Rn9E/s320/IMG_7603.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Shark Valley by about 1:45 and started driving towards our next
                destination - Marathon on the Florida Keys. It took an hour or so to get to Key
                Largo where we joined Route 1, The Ocean Highway. The drive down from there to
                Marathon was quite spectacular, particularly as we drove over some of the longer
                bridges.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got to Marathon just after 5 and checked into The Kingsail Motel where we had
                booked a room for the night. Although this was like a typical motel, we ended up
                with a room which opened up right in front of a small jetty which was all very
                pleasant.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a beer sat outside the room (one of my "300 Beers to Try Before You Die")
                before going out to eat. Once again, we had problems finding anywhere to eat
                within walking distance (although there were more options than last night) so
                ended up in Taco Bell. We were back in the room by 9:00.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th February
            </span>We had stayed in Marathon to visit the Turtle Hospital. I had bought Roz
            membership for Christmas and this entitles us both to unlimited free visits. We
            had booked a tour for 10:00. We checked out of the motel and drove a mile or so
            down the road to the hospital.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">The tour lasted about 90 minutes starting with a 30 minute
            presentation. We were shown round the hospital itself and then had 45 minutes or
            so visiting the patients. There were 30 turtles there, most of which were
            victims of boating accidents or were recovering from having tumours removed.
            Most of them will eventually be released but there were a few residents that
            will stay there for the rest of their lives.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            We left the hospital at about mid-day and continued driving down through the
            Keys to Key West which is as far as you can go. We got there by about 1:30 and
            had about an hour to wait before we could check in. We went out to get our
            photos of the USA's Southernmost point before checking in. The room we had here
            was pretty basic but prices here are very high and this was the cheapest we
            could get within walking distance of the main tourist area. After putting our
            stuff in the room, we went for a walk along Duval Street, which runs through the
            most touristy part of town and is also famous for its bars and nightlife. While
            quite nice in places, a lot of the area was a bit like being in Disneyland and
            was overrun with American cruise ship passengers.</p>

        <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
            src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3FgkS9O6SVA/UTFoynBebSI/AAAAAAAAKSM/TUJM24Mn6Wk/s320/IMG_7647.JPG"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had been looking forward to visiting the bars but most of them were pretty
            horrendous and overpriced. The Porch was just off Duval Street and was
            recommended by Lonely Planet. We went in there just after 4:30 and found that
            they had a happy hour from 4:30 - 6:30. It was a much nicer place than anywhere
            else we had seen and had a pretty good range of American and foreign beers. With
            happy hour prices, decent beer was $US3 a pint so we stayed in there until happy
            hour ended.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            We returned to the room for showers and warmer clothes and then walked back to
            The Porch stopping for pizza slices on the way. We had a couple more beers
            there, including the 200th of the 300 on my list, before moving on to The Green
            Parrot. This was just off Duval Street and was a pretty good bar with live
            music. We walked back to the motel at round about midnight.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 1st March
            </span>We left the motel at about 10:30 and started driving back towards Key
            Largo. We would of stayed two nights in Key West had it not been for the price
            of accommodation. There was nothing wrong with where we stayed but it was the
            worst room we have stayed in for a while and the most expensive since Tulum.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We drove back to Marathon stopping briefly for photos at Seven Mile Bridge on
            the way. Roz's membership gives unlimited visits to the Turtle Hospital and we
            had booked another tour for 1pm. This was very good again although slightly sad
            because Jib, one of the very badly injured turtles we saw yesterday had died
            overnight. We left the hospital at 3ish and continued along the Overseas Highway
            as far as Islamorada. We had not booked anywhere to stay for tonight but after
            looking at a few places, found a motel for $75 for the night.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon - we were both worn out and
            feeling the effects of last nights beer. We went out and ate in a restaurant for
            the first time in over a week. The Islamorada Shrimp Shack was only a few 100
            metres down the road so we could go out to eat without having to drive. We had
            excellent meals and returned&nbsp; to the room by about 8:00.</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 2nd March
            </span>We had to check out of the motel at 11:00 which was not ideal. We are now
            five hours behind England so the football kicked off at 10:00. We listened to
            the first half of soccer Saturday in the room before moving to following the
            second half on the laptop while sat in reception. We did not have far to drive
            today to our next stop - Key Largo about 18 miles away . We had booked three
            nights at the Key West Inn in Key Largo while we were in Cozumel. We found it
            without any problems and were checked in before 1:00.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got to our room, we found that we had a two storey apartment type thing
            with a small kitchen, a lounge and an upstairs bedroom. It has two bathrooms and
            can sleep five people. It was a lot better than we were expecting! After we had
            unpacked, we went out and checked with Rainbow Reef Divers that we are booked in
            to dive tomorrow. We had booked two days of diving but are not sure whether or
            not this was a good idea. Tomorrow is apparently due to be the coldest day in
            Florida since records began!</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            After the dive centre, we visited the biggest dive shop we have ever seen (and
            considered buying coats for the next two days). we also visited a supermarket
            and bought stuff for lunch which we ate back in the apartment. Another afternoon
            of not doing much. It was too cold to lie by the pool so spent most of the time
            in our lounge watching football on the TV. We had a couple of drinks while
            shivering on our balcony in the evening before walking to "Tower of Pizza" to
            eat. We had a couple more drinks when we got back but stopped drinking
            relatively early as we are diving tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 3rd March
            </span>Up at 6:45 to find it was raining and cold looking outside. The rain had
            stopped by the time we had walked to the pier for the dive boat just up the road
            from where we are staying but it was still not warm. We hired long wet suits for
            the day - the water temperature is about 22 - 23ºc and we would be frozen in our
            3mm shorties. The boat left the pier at about 8:30 and we were at the first site
            at about 9:00.</p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            We had chosen to dive unguided here. The first dive was at the Benwood Wreck
            which was scattered all over a sandy bottom in about 10 - 12 metres. The second
            was a long French Reef, another shallow dive. Both dives were OK without being
            too spectacular. There were plenty of fish to see and the vis was not bad. The
            water temperature was not too bad once we were in but the longer wetsuits were
            needed!

            There was only a fifteen minute surface interval between dives which is quite
            unusual but did mean that we were not sat around in the cold between dives for
            too long. It also meant that we were back in the motel by 12:00.</p>

            Had another afternoon of not doing a lot. We ate at a Cuban/Mexican place in the
            evening with a few drinks again but it was another relatively early night.</p>
