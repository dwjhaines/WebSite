                </span>The alarm went off at 6:10 but we were both tired because of the power
                cut last night, so reset it for 7:30 and went back to sleep. We had planned to
                go South again today but with the later start, we decided to go to a couple of
                Northern sites again instead. This did not work out too badly as the wind has
                picked up a bit causing a lot of surge. This in turn makes getting in and out of
                the water at the Southern sites a bit more difficult.</p>

                Our first dive at Oil Slick Leap was OK The second was at 1000 steps and was a
                lot better. The vis was terrible as we made our way out (again, due to the
                surge) but once at the reef it was fine. We saw one sleeping hawksbill turtle
                and, just as we were heading in from the buoy line, we came across an eagle ray
                lying in the sand. We have seen quite a lot of these in Bonaire on some trips
                but not seen one here before.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We changed tanks at Hamlet Oasis and went back to the Yacht Club for lunch. Dive
                number 3 was at "Something Special" which is just over the road from where we
                are staying. After about an hour of this dive, we came across Roz's turtle again
                (Turtle 1). We were only about half a mile from the reef where we normally see
                her in the evening at Bari Reef. There was a second hawksbill there that seemed
                keen on mating but it turned into a bit of a fight before he gave up and swam
                off. We had an 85 minute dive on Bari reef to finish the days diving. Not so
                much turtle activity tonight but Turtle 1 did eventually make it home.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We have a day off diving tomorrow so had a few drinks in the evening. We had a
                couple of beers on our balcony and one in the Yacht Club bar. We had been
                speaking to Dana again with more complaints about the apartment. Things are
                getting sorted out gradually and she had told us to go to the bar for a free
                drink. We walked to Captain Don's again to eat. Again, food was good and service
                bad but we had another free drink. We were back in the apartment by 10:00 and
                had a couple of hours drinking duty free Bacardi before going to bed.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 12th March
                </span>We had booked 12 days diving in the 13 full days we are on Bonaire.
                Having dived the last six days, today was our day off. We were later getting up
                this morning so managed to catch up on the sleep we had missed the previous
                night. We had a few things to do today. We took our empty tanks back to Sand
                Dollar and collected dive bags for rubbish collection. Dive Friends are trying
                to clean up the East coast of the island and ask people to volunteer on their
                days off. We drove over there and sadly, were able to almost totally fill the
                back of the pick-up with plastic bottles and other junk in about 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another visit to the supermarket to get food for the next week before
                returning to the Yacht Club for lunch. I went to the Dive Friends shop at Hamlet
                Oasis to get rid of the rubbish and to collect tanks for tomorrow mornings
                dives. While I was away, we had another fridge delivered. The first one leaked
                water all over everything. Our list of complaints is coming down slowly! We went
                into Kralendijk, Bonaire's main town at 2:30ish and spent an hour or so
                wandering around the souvenir shops. I went back in at 4 and got my hair cut.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the apartment,, our old fridge got taken away, our shower was unblocked
                and we had a tin-opener delivered to us. I think that after a week of staying
                here all our complaints have been sorted out. It would of been good if it had
                taken less than a week but at least they got there eventually! The Wi-Fi has
                stopped working but everyone is complaining about that, not just us.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not be bothered to go out to eat so cooked a meal again and ate it on
                our balcony.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VqFwE7J7WLQ/UUSr85M8tKI/AAAAAAAAKY8/XFco_woZZvg/s320/IMG_8053.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 13th March
                </span>Back to diving today and another three-dive trip down South. First dive
                was at Aquarius where again, the outer reef was spectacular. We dived at Margate
                Bay for the second dive. Usually this is a good place to see turtles but we did
                not see any today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was at Punt Vierkant. This was a new site
                for us and not the best of sites to be diving in the rough weather. The first
                two sites both had fairly sandy entries but here there was a lot of clambering
                over rocks. It would of been OK in calm conditions but there is still a lot of
                surge. The dive was good but getting out was not easy!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back relatively early today and after changing tanks and having lunch,
                we had a few hours back at the apartment. The fourth dive was Bari Reef at 5:30
                where both the turtles were around again. We had planned on driving into town to
                eat but, once again, by the time we had washed our gear, had showers and done
                our log books, it was getting late so we decided on a takeaway again. Pasa Bon
                had run out of pizzas so we drove to Captain Don's and picked up two from there
                instead. We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 14th March
                </span>We started the day with a 91 minute dive at Bari Reef. Although we dive
                this site every evening, most of our time there is been above 6m in the area
                where the turtles live. This morning, we went down to 30m and all the way along
                the reef to Buddy's. A very good way to start the day and we were joined on the
                dive by a tuna that stayed with us for about an hour for some reason.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o97G-uR7O5A/UUSsBX5B0LI/AAAAAAAAKZE/pmUOvt1VBNE/s320/IMG_8114.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the apartment for breakfast and then headed North. Our choice of
                dive sites was still limited by the surge. We stopped and looked at a couple of
                sites but after yesterday's ext at Punt Vierkant, decided not to risk either of
                them. We continued instead to 1000 Steps where there is a sandy entry with no
                rocks making it a lot safer in rough conditions. We had a very good dive there
                again on the Southern section of the site before returning to Buddy's. The house
                reefs are all have easy entry/exit points so this seemed a good option. We dived
                all the way to The Cliff and again it was an enjoyable dive.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another few hours back at the apartment. Roz went to the pool while I
                watched football and edited pictures. We had&nbsp; our usual hour or so with
                both the turtles at Bari Reef to complete the days diving. Again, we did not go
                out to eat but cooked a meal and ate it in the apartment.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 15th March
                </span>Back down South today. The conditions are still rough although they do
                seem to be getting better slowly. Several sites still looked too difficult to
                get to so we dived Aquarius twice. On both dives, we went out to the outer reef,
                once to the South which is deeper and once to the North towards Alice in
                Wonderland. Both dives were very good again. We went back to Dive Inn to change
                tanks and did our third dive at Calabas. We saw the frogfish again and three
                sea-horses including one that we had not seen before. We were also told about a
                frogfish at Something Special that we can go in search of tomorrow.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Dive number four was at Bari Reef as usual. We had a long wait for Roz's turtle
                tonight. We were on the point of giving up and ending the dive when she
                appeared. We watched her swim back to the area where she sleeps and then spend
                about 5 minutes trying to get under a different rock before moving to her usual
                sleeping place. No sign of Turtle 2 tonight.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Quite a late end to this dive so after washing our gear, we got a takeaway pizza
                from Pasa Bon.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 16th March
                </span>We had to plan our dives around the sport on TV today as we had both
                football and rugby that we wanted to watch. We were up at 6:00 and headed
                straight to Bari Reef. We did see Turtle 2 as we headed North but she was
                heading in the opposite direction so we were only with her for a couple of
                minutes. I collected more tanks from Yellow Submarine and, after a quick
                breakfast, we headed North for a final dive at 1000 Steps. This was a very good
                dive again with another two turtle sightings.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eNLM24wy8WI/UUUnmNEOnTI/AAAAAAAAKZc/YIeG80ybtZ8/s320/IMG_8183.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the apartment by 10:30 so were ready for the start of the
                Swansea v Arsenal game which was followed directly by Wales v England in the
                rugby.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After watching Swansea getting beaten and England getting
                hammered, we headed out to Something Special for our third dive of the day. We
                headed North here in search of the frogfish we had been told about yesterday.
                The whole dive was pretty good and thanks to some pretty good directions, we
                managed to find the frogfish after about 15 minutes. Although we have seen two
                frogfish this week I think they have been only the third and fourth we have seen
                in Bonaire. They are not that common here and are difficult to find if you are
                not with a guide who knows their location.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did not have long from the end of this dive until we were getting ready for
                the fourth at Bari Reef. Tonight was probably the best dive we have had here.
                Both the turtles were around and at one point they seemed to be getting
                together. We did not know if they were going to mate or fight (we are still not
                100% sure what the sex of either of them is) but they seemed to lose interest in
                each other after a few minutes. We must of spent almost an hour with them before
                getting out of the water just before 7:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We cooked in the apartment again after we had washed our gear and were in bed by
                about 10:00.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 17th March
                </span>Once again, our dive plans for today were influenced by the football,
                with Sunderland v Norwich on the TV at 9:30. We decided to do one long dive
                before the football and headed off to Bari Reef for 6:30. This turned into our
                longest ever dive at 108 minutes. We saw Roz's turtle after about 10
                minutes and stayed with her for 50 minutes as she headed South. We turned round
                after an hour as the current was picking up and swam back to the entry point.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the apartment by 9:00 and had breakfast before watching the
                football. We went out again at 11:30, stopped for tanks at Port Bonaire and
                continued to one of the first of the Southern sites - The Lake. This was a very
                good dive. We went out to the second reef and swam along that until we came to
                the Hilma Hooker again. We normally only see the wreck in the early morning but
                getting there just after midday meant it was much more lit up than usual and
                looked very impressive. Despite it being the middle of the day, there were no
                other divers on the wreck while we were there again.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to do the third dive at Invisibles but the entry point looked a
                but tricky there (the surge is dying down but is still a problem) so continued
                South to Tori's Reef instead. This was OK again without being too spectacular.
                We changed tanks again at Port Bonaire, called into the supermarket and had
                about 20 minutes in the apartment before going off to Bari Reef for our evening
                dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After seeing the same turtle on this site the previous 19 times we have dived it
                in the evening, we did not see her tonight. Turtle 2 was around but despite
                waiting on the reef until about 6:40, there was no sign of Turtle 1. We had to
                give up waiting as it was getting dark by this time. Still a good dive but a bit
                of a surprise.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the apartment, we washed our gear and had a couple of drinks before
                walking to Captain Don's for a meal. We had burgers instead of pizzas this time,
                had one more drink back at the apartment and were in bed just after 10:00.</p>
