<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 25th June</span> We were up by about 9 after getting about four hours 
			sleep. We had breakfast at the hotel and then got a taxi out to the 
			airport at about 10:30. We checked in without any problems - a 
			relief after what happened with our tickets in Vienna. Once again we 
			had business class tickets so made our way to the lounge where the 
			complimentary vodka did seem to improve things after last night! 
			Looking ahead, the weather does not seem to of got much better since 
			we were last in Germany and still does not look good for camping. We 
			had decided that if we were not camping we would try and stay in 
			Bamberg on the way home so while in the lounge, we booked an 
			apartment there for Wednesday and Thursday nights.&nbsp; The flight 
			was uneventful and we were back in Vienna by 3:00. We got the 
			airport bus back to the Westbahnhof and just after 4, we were 
			checked into the same Ibis we had been in a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p class="diary-text">We decided to go straight out for a few drinks. We called into a bar 
			next to the hotel for a couple and started heading towards the 
			Sternbrau 7 area again. We did not get very far! Within a few 
			hundred meters, we found "Känguruh" an excellent bar with a huge range of 
			Belgium and local beers. There was a local "beer journalist" in 
			there filming a television program when we arrived and he later told 
			us about a beer festival in Antwerp which may also be an option on 
			the way home. Spent the rest of the evening in the bar and do not 
			remember leaving!</p>

<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th June</span> Got up and checked out of the hotel by 9:15 before 
			walking over to the Westbahnhof. We bought food from a supermarket 
			and had breakfast after we had got on the 10:14 train to Munich. 
			This train was a lot more crowded than the one going in the opposite 
			direction a couple of weeks ago but we still got seats and it was an 
			fairly comfortable journey of just over four hours. We arrived at 
			the main station at 2:30 and went for a beer in the Botanical Garden 
			Beer Garden before getting the U-Bahn to our apartment. The 
			apartment was one of the best places we have stayed at in Munich - a 
			big room with balcony and only about 5 - 10 metres from the entrance 
			to a U-Bahn station.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We went out for a few beers at 7ish. We got the U-Bahn back into 
			Marienplatz and walked down to the Augustiner-Grossgast<font face="Times New Roman">ä</font>tte. 
			We had a few in there with food and then walked to Donisl (big dog 
			pub) for one. At 9ish we headed for the Wheat Beer House. We had 
			planned to end up in the Hofbrauhaus but ended up staying where we 
			were until about midnight. For the second night running, I do not 
			remember getting back to the hotel.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 27th June</span> Had breakfast on the balcony of the apartment before 
			returning to the Mercure Hotel where we had left the car 18 days 
			ago. The car was exactly as we had left it. It had acquired another 
			noise by the time we set off but seemed to be still running OK. We 
			drove North about 150 miles to Bamberg a journey of about 2.5 hours. 
			We found the apartment with no problems and checked in just after 
			2pm. We bought lunch from a supermarket and ate it in the apartment 
			before falling asleep for a couple of hours.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We went out for a walk just after 5. We had been to Bamberg before 
			but not for about 15 years so could only vaguely remember the town. 
			We picked up cycling maps for tomorrow from the tourist information 
			office and spent an hour or so wandering round the old town. We were 
			in need of a day off beer so we got a take-away pizza and returned 
			to the apartment to watch Portugal v Spain.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ckWZfssA2XM/T-4enaHxrbI/AAAAAAAAEtM/0aSZr-b2QeM/s320/IMG_1261.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th June</span> Breakfast in the apartment and then out on our bikes 
			for about four hours. We did the "Stadt-Land-Fluss" Tour from the 
			book we had got yesterday. This was a fairly easy circular route 
			from Bamberg of about 32 miles. Although not that strenuous, it felt 
			good to be doing some exercise again after spending a lot of the 
			last three weeks doing nothing but eating and drinking!</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We went out on our bikes again in the evening to visit a pub about a 
			mile from where we were staying and then walked into the old town to 
			watch the Germany v Italy semi-final. There were loads of people out 
			and about for this game and it was a struggle to get a table 
			anywhere but we eventually got seats outside a restaurant with a big 
			screen. It was an enjoyable evening despite the fact that we had 
			wanted Germany to win. Got soaked walking home again - our decision 
			not to camp looks like the correct one.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 29th June</span> We had booked to stay three nights in Bamberg. After 
			breakfast we spent some time looking for places to stay on the way 
			back to Bruges. The weather still does not look good for camping and 
			the best option we could come up with was to stay here another 
			night. Bamberg is an excellent town and we seem to be running out of 
			time to do everything we want to. Also, the weather here is better 
			here than it is further North. We found the owner who said our room 
			was available so we are now staying here until Sunday.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tNT-zrd_JNQ/T_KXoubZKDI/AAAAAAAAEto/syk8uTwqz_I/s320/IMG_1263.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
We 
			went for a walk into the old town at 11ish. Spent a couple of hours 
			wandering around and bought some souvenirs. Were back in the 
			apartment for lunch and went out on our bikes later than planned at 
			about 3. We had decided to do another route from our book - the "Wasser 
			und Bier" Tour. We had planned to do most of the route before 
			heading to Schammelsdorf to visit the Knoblach Brewery which had 
			been recommended to us by the bloke we had met in Vienna. As it was, 
			we missed a turning on the tour meaning we left the route early. 
			This did not work out too badly as it was very hot and it meant that we 
			did not cycle as far as we had expected to. We ended up 
			getting to the brewery slightly earlier than expected after a short beer stop on the way. The brewery was very good and after a 
			beer there, we cycled about 12km back into Bamberg. This was 
			slightly downhill all the way and was very enjoyable. Neither of us 
			had realised how much we had climbed to get to Schammelsdorf.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			After quick showers, we went out to eat at one of the breweries 
			nearest to where we are staying (there are lots of breweries in 
			Bamberg!). We had probably our best meal of the trip for abut €8 
			each at the Fässla Brewery - schnitzel 
			and chips covered in beer and onion gravy as well as a few beers. We 
			walked across the road the Spezial brewery where I sampled the Rauch 
			Beir (smoked beer) that Bamberg is famous for. The two breweries both closed 
			at 10:30 and we could to be bothered to walk into the old town so we 
			had a relatively early night.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th June</span> We went out on our bikes earlier today, leaving the 
			apartment not long after 10:00. We did a 38 mile round trip, cycling 
			up the Main cycle path (as in the river Main) and back again on the 
			opposite side of the river. Once again the route was not that 
			strenuous but by about midday, it was getting very hot again and the 
			ride back to Bamberg was hard work. We got back to the apartment 
			de-hydrated and sun-burnt by about 2:30 and did not do a lot for the 
			rest of the afternoon apart from buying a few local beers from the 
			supermarket to take home with us.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rLCvUqtWGvo/T_KXmNdt2iI/AAAAAAAAEtg/P-1lKhdk558/s320/IMG_1295.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We 
			went out for a few beers again in the evening visiting both the 
			Klosterbräu and Schlenkerla breweries. 
			Schlenkerla is the home of Bamberg's most famous Rauch Bier and I 
			was expecting this bar to be a bit touristy. However, it was another 
			excellent place - one of the best bars we have been to on the trip 
			so far. I enjoyed the beer a lot more than I did when trying it 
			previously although Roz was not so impressed and switched to 
			drinking wine.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">We had a few in there before walking 
			home, a journey interrupted by the worst thunder storm we have seen 
			since we have been away. It was impossible to walk in the wind and 
			rain so we had to shelter in a shop doorway for about 15 minutes 
			until the worst of it had passed. We were still totally soaked by 
			the time we were back at the apartment. Our tent would definitely 
			not have survived if we had been camping! </font></p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 1st July</span> Checked out of the apartment just after 10 and 
			continued our journey back towards England. We drove 275 miles to 
			Wuppertal where we had booked a room at the Novotel for the night. 
			Wuppertal had been chosen because the hotel was cheap with free 
			parking and was close to the motorway. It should only take a couple 
			of hours to get to Bruges tomorrow. We got to Wuppertal in about four hours, 
			despite heavy rain for most of the journey 
			and were checked into the room just after 2pm. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Wuppertal is not big on 
			tourist attractions! We were not bothered about going out in the 
			evening so we got a take-away pizza again and watched the final of 
			Euro2012 in our room.</p>
