                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 10th December
                </span>Two local dives today so it was up at 6:30 again. We dived at Ko Bida
                Nok, the same site that we did three days ago and Peleh Wall, a site that we had
                not dived before. Both dives were very good again and we were kept entertained
                during the surface interval by a boatload of Miss Tourism contestants which was
                tied to ours in Maya Bay.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                As usual, we got sandwiches on the way back to the room and had lunch on the
                balcony and did not do much for the rest of the day. Ate out at Tom Yam in the
                evening.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 11th December
                </span>A very similar day to yesterday with two more local dives. We dived Bida
                Nok for a third time and it was probably the best of the three. We saw a leopard
                shark for the first time in ages. There used to be loads of these in this area
                but we did not see any at Christmas last year and had not seen any yet on this
                trip. It was good to know that they do still exist here.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive was Malong to Maya Bay. This was very good as well with plenty
                of turtles as always.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Sandwiches for lunch and a pretty good Indian meal in the evening.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 12th December
                </span>We had another trip to King Cruiser today. We had looked at tide tables
                and decided that today would be a good day to dive the wreck as there did not
                seem to be much current between 9 and 10. This worked out very well as the
                conditions were as good as we have ever had here. The was no current at all and
                the visibility was very good. We were able to cover the whole of the wreck but
                could stay relatively shallow as there was no need to look for shelter from the
                current. There were huge schools of fish at both ends of the wreck and it was
                probably the best dive we have ever had here.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EZXcEEZBSRY/UM6aNcOlHYI/AAAAAAAAIrM/emDf0SefggI/s320/IMG_6758.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The current had picked up by the second dive at Shark Point. This did not spoil
                the dive (for us anyway) but it was decided that the current was too strong to
                dive at Anemone Reef. We returned to Phi Phi instead and did the third dive at
                Ko Bida Noi. This was another good dive although there was a lot of dead coral
                compared to when we have dived it previously.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the room by 5ish. We had a few drinks on the balcony while doing
                log books before going out to eat. We ate at Tom Yam while getting through a
                bottle of Sang Som and bought a "Sang Som Bucket" to drink back on the balcony.
                Only vaguely remember going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th December
                </span>Spent just about the whole day lying in bed feeling ill. I was not too
                bad when we went to breakfast but deteriorated during the morning. I was sick in
                the afternoon for the first time in years and was struggling to drink water let
                alone eat anything. I felt slightly better by the evening and was able to walk
                to the dive centre to book diving for tomorrow, but was still not up to eating
                much. I was back in bed by about 8:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 14th December
                </span>Woke up feeling better today. Still not 100% but well enough to go
                diving. We did two local dives - Koh Bida Nok and Malong to Maya Bay again. We
                got dropped at a different part of Bida Nok today. In theory, this was the
                deeper side but the water was really murky at about 15m so we never got to see
                the deep part. Still a nice dive again and dive number 1200 for Roz. At Malong,
                we had another 20 minutes with the turtles before continuing towards Maya Bay.
                Very enjoyable as always.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather was pretty poor today so we did not do a lot when we got back to the
                room Although feeling better, I did not feel up to Thai food so we went to
                Cosmic Pizza again in the evening. I only managed to eat about half what I would
                of usually eaten but have just about recovered.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th December
                </span>Our last two dives from Phi Phi today and our last two dives for this
                part of the trip. We did the same two sites as yesterday although did not bother
                with the deep side of Bida Nok today. We saw our second leopard shark on the
                first dive and Roz also saw a turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was excellent. We were dropped in the
                turtle area again and spent the first 30 - 35 minutes of the dive watching two
                hawksbill turtles eating. We continued round to the entrance to Maya Bay which
                is one of the nicest parts of any of the local sites. A very good dive to finish
                on and also dive number 1200 for me.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had hoped to dry most of our gear on the balcony in the afternoon but for the
                second day running the weather was poor and we had quite a lot of rain. Did not
                do much for the rest of the day although we did walk back into the centre in the
                evening to buy our ferry tickets for tomorrow and a few things to take home.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before going out to eat. I still did
                not really feel like alcohol but I seemed to cope with a couple of bottles of
                beer. We ate at Tom Yam before returning to the Sports Bar to watch Man Utd. v
                Sunderland. We had another drink on the balcony when we got back but did not end
                up too drunk as we have an early start tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 16th December
                </span>We got up at 7 and packed a lot of damp things into our bags. With the
                wet weather in the last couple of days and the high humidity, nothing dries
                properly and even things that have not been wet seem damp. We carried our
                luggage down to the restaurant, had breakfast and checked out. We collected our
                damp dive gear from Phi Phi Scuba and walked to the ferry pier for the 9:00 boat
                to Phuket.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PGdxMNs-BXk/UNHRm_5ReXI/AAAAAAAAIyA/mAreUbeZYw8/s320/IMG_6886.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey went as smoothly as we could of hoped. The ferry left on time and
                arrived at Phuket by about 10:40. We had tickets for a mini-bus transfer to Nai
                Yang. This took us directly to our hotel and we were checked in to our room by
                midday. We had lunch at Marina Seafood, on the beach opposite the hotel and
                spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool or catching up on sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The room at Phi Phi was close enough to the main bars on
                the island to be able to hear loud music until 4 in the morning and the last two
                nights seem to have been particularly bad. I think we are getting too old for
                such places! It was very nice to be in a room with air conditioning and hot
                water for the first time in ten days as well.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked out to the main road to buy beer, water, Sang Som, etc at 5ish and had
                our first drinks on the balcony by about 6:30. We ate at Marina Seafood again in
                the evening and then went in search of a bar showing Spurs v Swansea. Wat's bar
                which we have watched football in before seemed to have doubled its drinks
                prices in the last 12 months but we found a new place a bit further down the
                beach with a huge screen and cheaper prices. They turned off the music and
                turned on the commentary when they saw me in a Swansea shirt. It was an ideal
                place for watching the game. We had a bottle of Sang Som in there and returned
                to our balcony to drink another one after the game. Got to bed sometime around
                1am.</p>
