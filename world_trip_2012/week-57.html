                </span>Three more relatively local dives today. Roz managed to get her high
                pressure hose changed before the first dive.&nbsp; She has the same problem with
                the swivel joint that I had in Mexico but at least the hose is not leaking any
                more. We were diving on our own with Dave again today with quite a few other
                people on the boat. The first dive was at Black Ray Channel. This dive was OK
                and we did see two hawksbills but not too much else. Another group saw a manta
                or devil ray which we must of missed by about a minute.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Dive two was at Kapalai House Reef. This is a site we have dived a lot in the
                past but had not been to yet this year. There was still plenty to see. No
                ornates but four "leafies" (as leaf scorpion fish now appear to be known) and
                another turtle on one of the artificial houses.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch it was back to Awas for a 107 minute dive. We pretty much saw the
                same things as a few days ago but it was still a really enjoyable dive. Not as
                many turtles today but a tiny cockatoo wasp fish at the end of the dive. We went
                to the Scuba Junkie bar for a beer after eating and had one more beer on the
                balcony while doing log books but it was still an early night as we have another
                early start tomorrow.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th June
                </span>Our final day of diving at Sipadan. We were supposed to be diving with
                Khai but he was not feeling well so he took the two OW divers instead. We dived
                with Stu together with two Danish blokes and Hannah from Holland. It was another
                excellent day's diving. We dived South Point first followed by Mid Reef, a site
                we have not dived this year, and then Barracuda Point for the third. We were all
                given the option of where we wanted to do the final dive and just about
                unanimously agreed to do Barracuda again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                All the dives were excellent. There was a lot more current than on previous days
                here but it was not too bad and everyone was able to cope. We did not se
                anything that we have not seen already but there were another 51 sharks and 87
                turtles. It had been another very good day out and it was very sad to be leaving
                the island for the last time.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks in the bar in the evening and a few more on our balcony
                after eating.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th June
                </span>Three more local dives today to complete our diving for this trip. We
                checked out of our room after breakfast, left our luggage in the restaurant and
                were on the jetty by 9:00. We were guide by Nas again today and also had Sara
                and Andreas with us. First dive was at Cleaning Station on Kapalai. This was
                Roz's favourite site here last year due to the turtles that were always sleeping
                in the structures at the start of the site. There were none there today which
                was disappointing but we did see a hawksbill and it was still a good dive. We
                did Artificial Reef for the second dive. We have done this site quite a lot in
                previous years but this was the first time here on this visit. Quite a bit to
                see on this dive frog fish, cuttle fish, etc and one more green turtle.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Our last dive, after lunch back at the resort was at Panglima Reef. This was not
                an ideal choice of dive site as there was strong currents and crap vis. It was
                not the best dive of the trip but still enjoyable enough and we saw another
                eight turtles. This bought the total number of turtles that Roz has counted to
                451 in the sixteen days since we arrived in Semporna!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Within about 15 minutes of getting out of the water, we had returned to the
                jetty, washed all our gear and were leaving Mabul for the last time. We were
                back in Semporna by 5ish and after sorting out a few things at the Dive Shop, we
                walked back to the Seafest Hotel where we had booked a room for the night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks in the room before going out to eat and then called
                into the Scuba Junkie bar for a beer before walking back to the hotel. We spent
                the rest of the evening looking at photos from earlier in the trip while
                drinking our Philippine rum.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th June
                </span>We walked into Semporna for breakfast when we woke up - roti canai in Al
                Nasifah. Roz stayed in there using their Wi-Fi while I went and got my hair cut.
                We walked to the cash-point for a final time and then returned to Scuba Junkie
                to pay the remainder of our bill. We said goodbye to Nic and Nas who were both
                in the shop due to ear problems and walked back to the Seafest.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel at 1 but stayed up at the pool until 2:30. We
                returned to Al Nasifah for a second round of roti canai for lunch and then
                waited in the hotel reception area until just before 4:00 for our taxi to Tawau
                airport. We were at the airport by 5:00 and checked in for the 7:15 Air Asia
                flight to Kuala Lumpa. The flight was slightly late leaving but was still in KL
                by 10:00. We collected our luggage, got a burger from McDonalds and checked into
                the Tune hotel for the third time on this trip.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 28th June
                </span>We checked out of the Tune Hotel at 8ish and walked back to the LCCT. We
                checked in for the 10:40 flight to Bangkok and then went to find somewhere for
                breakfast. We had hoped to have our last meal of roti canai but a lot of food
                places had closed down as the airport is moving soon so we ended up with our
                second meal in a row at McDonalds. We cleared immigration, bought a few things
                from the duty free shop and had about an hour to wait for our flight. The flight
                was just about on time and by 12:00 local time, we landed at Don Muang airport
                in Bangkok.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got through the airport fairly quickly and had about an hours taxi journey to
                the Asia Hotel. We have stayed here several times before but not since 2007. It
                was good to find that the reception staff are just as incompetent, inefficient
                and impolite as they were six years ago. It took over an hour before we were
                finally in our room after a few arguments about whether or not the room was
                ready and then being given a room that had a wall in front of the window. By
                3pm, we were in our room with a view of the sky-train station. Not quite up to
                the standard of some of the views we have had in the last couple of months but
                better than the wall!
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Once we were in our room, we were able to go out for lunch. We walked to the MBK
                shopping centre and ate in the food court upstairs. We had a quick look round
                the shops and walked back to the hotel via the 7-11.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks in our room in the evening before walking down to Siam
                Square to eat. We ate at Ban Khun Mae which is one of our favourite restaurants
                anywhere. We have been coming here for years but had to queue for a table
                tonight for the first time. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and then
                walked back to the hotel to continue looking through our photos.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th June
                </span>Did not do a lot all day today. We had planned to go out and do some
                sight-seeing but put that off until tomorrow when we realised that the second
                rugby test between the Lions and Australia was kicking off&nbsp; at 5:00. We
                spent a bit of time at the pool and went to MBK for lunch but did not do much
                else.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At 4:30, we got the sky-train from the hotel to Sukumvit Road. This area has a
                lot of English type pubs. We ended up in The Huntsman which had several
                televisions showing the rugby and sold wheat beer. We had a few beers in there
                during the game and then got a tuk-tuk back to Siam Square at about 7:30. We had
                another bottle of sang som with our meal at Ban Khun Mae and only vaguely
                remember walking back to the hotel.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th June
                </span>The last day of the trip! We did not do a lot in the morning but headed
                out for our sight-seeing at 12:30.. We got a boat along the canal from near the
                hotel and then walked to Khao San Road. After a few photos here, we walked down
                to the main river that runs through the middle of Bangkok. We got on another
                boat here and travelled down the river past a lot of the main sights. There was
                nothing that we particularly wanted to see but the boat journeys themselves are
                quite enjoyable. We got off the boat at Central Pier and then got the sky-train
                back to MBK for lunch.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by about 3:30. We had booked a late check-out which
                meant that we had the room until 6:00. Just after 6:00, we checked out of the
                hotel and got a taxi to the airport. We had about 90 minutes to wait at the
                airport before we could check-in. By about 8:45, we were in the BA lounge,
                probably for the last time! We had three hours or so in there before boarding
                the plane. As we went to board, we were told that we had been up-graded to
                economy plus so had bigger seats for the flight home. We had a few more drinks
                on the plane before falling asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived on time in Heathrow at 6am on Monday morning. After collecting our
                luggage we phoned the car-park company to find they had gone bankrupt and had
                been taken over by Purple Parking who had no details of the car. It took about
                10 - 15 minutes for them to find it and we left the airport by 7:30. Traffic not
                too bad so were back in Kingsclere by 8:30</p>
