<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 23rd July</span> Up for breakfast by 7, we checked out of the hotel at 
			7:45 and walked across the road to Scuba Junkie. We loaded our gear 
			onto the boat and set off for Mabul at about 8:30. We were in Mabul 
			by 9:15 and were met at the pier by Carys, one of the managers who 
			we have known for some time from diving in Koh Lanta. We left our 
			luggage at the dive centre and returned to the boat for the first 
			dive of the day. We dived with Debi and one other diver - Rick, a 
			dive instructor from Bournemouth. All three dives today were "muck 
			dives" in the area quite close to the pier. The fist dive was at 
			Kapali house reef, about 5 minutes away by boat. The second at 
			Artificial reef just round the corner. The third was at Awas, right 
			in front of the pier. All three dives were very good. We had done 
			the same three sites as our first dives here last year and there was 
			still loads to see. All the usual stuff was here - frog fish, ghost 
			pipe fish, nudibranchs, etc. We saw a seahorse on the third dive 
			where we also saw our first three turtles of the day. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Mabul between each of the dives. In between the first 
			and second dives we checked into our room - it was the one that we 
			stayed in last year and had requested again. It is the closest room 
			to the beach and has a slightly better balcony than the others. 
			Lunch was between dives two and three.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back at the resort by 4:30 so had time to unpack before the 
			evening meal at 7:00. Food seems to have improved since last year - 
			both meals today have been pretty good. Sat chatting to Rick and his 
			girlfriend for an hour or so after eating and were back in the room 
			by 9:30.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aJH_HcdAC8Y/UBplO-jpgoI/AAAAAAAAFCE/r_ozZ31hd90/s320/IMG_1019.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 24th July</span> Our first day diving at Sipadan. Sipadan is one of the 
			best diving locations in the world. To preserve the island, only 120 
			permits are issued to dive there each day. Scuba Junkie only get 7 of those 
			permits despite the fact that they are now the biggest dive operator 
			in the area. To get one of the permits, you have to do several days 
			diving at other sites and book well in advance. Because we are doing 
			a total of 14 days diving with Scuba Junkie. we should be going four 
			times during our stay on Mabul.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			A Sipadan day starts early. There is a small breakfast put out in 
			the dining room at 6:00 so that we can all be on the jetty by 6:15. 
			There were two guides on the boat (Simon and Khai) as well as the 
			seven customers. We were in a group with Rick, who we had dived with 
			yesterday, and his Thai girlfriend, Ann. Our group was led by the Malaysian 
			guide - Khai.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			As expected, it was an excellent days diving. The first dive 
			featured a lot of sharks but surprisingly, no turtles. Loads more 
			sharks on the second dive and three turtles. The third at Barracuda 
			Point was quite eventful. It was the strongest current we have ever 
			experienced at Sipadan. We went straight down but Ann struggled with 
			the current and could not go down so the others drifted away from us. We were 3 or 4 minutes into 
			the dive when we realised that they were no-where to be seen so 
			surfaced to find them. We all got picked up by the boat and were 
			returned to the entry point and all managed to get down this time. 
			Loads more sharks and three more turtles. The final dive was at 
			Drop-off. On this dive Roz counted 32 turtles - a new record for a 
			single dive. Particularly towards the end, there were turtles 
			everywhere. Whichever direction you looked, another one seemed to 
			appear from somewhere. A very good dive to end the day with!!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had planned to have another week off alcohol and have not had 
			anything to drink since Sandakan. However, tonight we both felt like 
			having a couple of drinks so had a beer in the bar and then a few 
			Bacardi and cokes on our balcony. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 25th July</span> Another day of local diving around Mabul. We dived with 
			Khai again and a Canadian couple, Brett and Heather. Another good days diving with 
			three dives at Black Ray Channel, Sea Ventures and Eel Garden. 
			Plenty to see on all the dives with more frog fish (one on each 
			dive) a robust ghost pipe fish at Sea Ventures and on the third 
			dive, two sea moths, two ribbon eels and two more turtles.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Totally worn out after the three dives today. We ate with the couple 
			we dived with earlier and were back in the room by 9:00.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 26th July</span> Second trip to Sipadan. A very similar day to the one 
			we had on Tuesday. This time, the guides were Dave and Sofia. We 
			dived with Dave and Brett and Heather again.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3byS2TAQPFI/UBpk_jFiT4I/AAAAAAAAFB8/0Xay_qCHVQk/s320/IMG_1100.JPG"></div>
<p align="justify">
Once again, it was an excellent days diving. Three of the four dives 
			were at the same sites as on Tuesday. We started at South Point 
			again. The visibility was better than it had been on Tuesday and 
			probably better than at any time we dived here last year. We saw 
			over twenty sharks on the first dive and Roz spotted five turtles 
			although I only saw one of them. The second dive was at White Tip 
			Avenue, a site we had never dived before. This was also very good 
			with plenty more sharks. Barracuda Point was superb again. The huge 
			schools of jacks and barracuda were more spectacular in the 
			increased visibility and once again, there seemed to be sharks 
			everywhere.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			The best dive of the day was the fourth again. We went in at 
			Drop-off but this time, we could make it round to Barracuda Point. 
			Roz counted over twenty turtles (some of which caused me to go into 
			deco!), there were more sharks, we saw the jacks and barracuda again 
			and the dive ended by spending 5 - 10 minutes watching a school of 
			bump-head parrot fish. We have seen one or two of these before and 
			have been out looking for them on a previous trip to Sipadan, but we 
			have never seen them in such large numbers. There were about 25 - 30 
			of them hanging around in about 5 metres. This was an ideal way of 
			spending a slightly extended safety stop and was a perfect end to 
			what has been another very good day.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We went up 
			to the bar for a beer before tea and spent an hour or so chatting to 
			the people we have been diving with today. Everyone was worn out 
			from the four dives so we were still back in the room by 8:30.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 27th July</span> We had expected to be diving Mabul again today but 
			found out last night that there we were on a two tank trip to 
			Simamil, another island about 40 minutes away. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We dived with Brett and Heather again and were led this time by 
			Sofia. The first dive at Second Beach was not great. We did not 
			really see a lot during the dive and the coral was not particularly 
			spectacular. Some of the other groups saw eagle rays but we didn't. 
			The second dive was much better - a 72 minute "muck dive" in the 
			shallows. Loads to see here although probably not as much as when we 
			did the dive with a Malaysian guide last year. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch on the beach before returning to Mabul for the third 
			dive of the day. A whale shark had been spotted at the back of the 
			island earlier in the day so we headed round to lobster wall near to 
			where it had been seen. Inevitably, we did not see it but did see 
			another three turtles and it was a nice enough dive again.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Had another early night without doing a lot.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 28th July</span> Another brilliant days diving. It was our third trip to 
			Sipadan. Dave and Khai were the guides. Like two days ago, Dave was 
			our guide, and we were diving with Brett and Heather for the fourth 
			day running.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The first dive of the day was at Barracuda Point . This was Roz's 
			1000th dive and was almost as good as the previous dives we have had 
			here. The vis was better again than it was two days ago. Only 4 
			turtles but Roz counted 40 sharks during the dive. The second dive 
			at South Point was excellent again. There seemed to be sharks 
			everywhere. Roz counted 27 but it seemed as if there were at least 
			as many as on the first dive. Everyone says you do not go to Sipadan 
			to look at the reef but the hard coral at the end of this dive was 
			very spectacular - one of the advantages to limiting the number of 
			divers here. The third would have been a pretty good dive anywhere 
			else but the vis had deteriorated quite a lot and we "only" saw 5 
			turtles and 7 sharks. Although still good, it was a bit of an 
			anti-climax after the previous two.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8SNQzzNAgs8/UBpl3DxXbqI/AAAAAAAAFCU/5vdoRZ2WQo0/s320/IMG_1268.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">
The final dive of the day, and my 1000th, was back at Barracuda 
			Point. This was another brilliant dive and a very good way to bring 
			up the 1000. The first 25 minutes of the dive were spent at 5 - 8 
			metres with the huge school of Jacks and the school of barracuda. 
			The vis was back to being really good again, the sun was shining, 
			and hanging in the middle of the jacks in particular was a genuinely 
			awesome experience. After drifting away from the barracuda, we 
			continued along the reef to the channel where once again there were 
			sharks and turtles everywhere (16 sharks and 14 turtles). A perfect 
			dive to end the day.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			There was a quiz night in the Scuba Junkie bar after the evening 
			meal. We had a team of six with Brett and Heather plus another 
			couple who had been to Sipadan with us. We had intended to have a 
			few drinks tonight anyway and had&nbsp; a few beers while in the 
			bar. We managed to win the quiz so got given more beer and did not 
			leave the bar until about 11:30. We had a couple more drinks on our 
			balcony while watching the rain and got to bed sometime around 1am.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 29th July</span> Three local dives today. We dived in the same group as 
			we have been in for the last few days i.e. with Brett and Heather 
			and Dave guiding. The first two dives were back at Kapali at two 
			sites we have already been to. We went first to Black Ray Channel 
			where we saw 10 turtles. We had not been expecting this as we had 
			not seen any the first time we came here. The second dive was Kapali 
			House Reef which was pretty good again. We had lunch back on Mabul 
			before diving Awas in front of the resort again. This was also a 
			good dive especially the huge sea turtles at the end. Back on the 
			jetty, we said goodbye to Brett and Heather who left for Semporna. 
			They have been very good to dive with for the last five days but we 
			will have to find new people to dive with from tomorrow.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we were very tired from the diving and lack of sleep 
			last night. I was back in the room by 8 after eating and it was a 
			much earlier night than yesterday. We were both asleep not long 
			after 9. </p>
