<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 3rd September </span>We did not have much that we wanted to do in Hong Kong 
			but headed out at about 10:00 when we had both got up 
			to have a look around the sights. We had enjoyed the bus journey in 
			last night so instead of going on the MTR (underground) we got a 
			couple of trams which took us to the Central area along the same 
			route. At Central, we had a trip up to Mid Levels on the escalators 
			before walking back down to the Star Ferry terminal. We took the 
			ferry across the harbour to Kowloon and had a look round a couple of 
			camera shops (Roz's underwater camera needs replacing) before 
			getting the ferry back to Hong Kong Island. We got the MTR back to 
			the hotel and were back in the room by 3:00. It was a very enjoyable 
			few hours but one day here was probably enough.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had been due to fly home via Helsinki tomorrow morning but our 
			flights had been cancelled. We found this out by chance just before 
			leaving home - BA had not notified us. After a lot of phone calls 
			and e-mails, we had been put on a direct flight to London tonight at 
			11:40. We had also been upgraded to Economy Plus as an apology for 
			there lack of communication.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel at 6:30 (the room was booked and paid for until 
			tomorrow) and walked across to the bus stop where we got the 6:45 
			bus to the airport. Again, it was an enjoyable one hour journey. At 
			the airport, we could check in immediately and were given a second 
			upgrade to business class - not bad considering we paid just over 
			Â£100 each for these flights.&nbsp; We went straight through passport 
			control and into the lounge for a few hours before the flight. We 
			had a few drinks in the lounge and boarded the plane at about 11:30. 
			The business class section was very good with loads more room than 
			we needed and seats that recline to form flat beds. All very nice 
			but not worth the sort of money that people pay for these seats!</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We spent a few more hours drinking and I think we got to sleep 
			sometime around 10pm UK time.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th September </span>Were woken for breakfast at about 3am and arrived at 
			Heathrow slightly early just after 5. We collected the car and were 
			back in Kingsclere just before 7.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aaikN1vqET8/UExGCQ0NPiI/AAAAAAAAF_4/hesvUEwNuFg/s320/IMG_2796.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th September </span>After 48 hours at home, we were on our way back to 
			Heathrow at 10:45 as we headed out to Moldova for the England game 
			tomorrow night. We met up with Mark and Steve in the bar at Terminal 
			1 for a pint before getting on the 1:15 Lufthansa flight to Munich.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were in Munich before 4:00 which meant that we had four and a 
			half hours in AirBrau - the airport brewery. This was an excellent 
			place to drink with cheap beer and good food. We left the brewery at 
			8:30 and went back into Terminal 2 for the 9:25 flight to Chisinau. 
			On this flight we were sat just behind quite a lot of the 
			commentators flying out for the game (Andy Townsend, Danny Mills and 
			Gareth Southgate). We arrived on time in Chisinau, just after 1am 
			and were met by a taxi to take us to Hotel Lidia.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9IWnAczQtWA/UExH4F_uHVI/AAAAAAAAGAQ/lAPmupKlM60/s320/IMG_2805.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th September </span>We were all up for breakfast at 9 before returning to 
			our rooms for showers. We left the hotel just at 11ish and walked 
			over to the hotel where the FA are based so that we could pick up 
			our tickets for tonight's game. There are not a lot of spectacular 
			sights to see in Chisinau and we saw a lot of what there is to see 
			(a few big buildings) on the way to the hotel. We also picked up our 
			copies of Free Lions on the way and got our tickets with no 
			problems.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We sat reading Free Lions in a nearby park for 20 minutes or so and 
			then went for our first beer of the day. By this time, we had 
			realised that with the lack of things to do here, we needed to find 
			something to occupy us for tomorrow. We had heard about trips out to 
			wine cellars that this area was famous for and after having a drink, we 
			returned to our hotel to look into the options. On the internet we 
			found the address of a travel agent that organised tours and went 
			out to try and find it. We did not make it to the planned travel 
			agent but found another one on the way. We spent more than an hour 
			in the office and eventually came away having booked a trip for 
			tomorrow starting at 11:00 from our hotel.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we had paid for the tour and had our vouchers printed, 
			it was getting on for 4:00. We got a taxi out to The Beer House 
			(recommended by Lonely Planet) where we had a late lunch and a few 
			more beers. After leaving there, we wandered towards the railway 
			station in search of cheaper bars. We found one right outside the 
			station which had beer for 55p a pint and stayed there until about 
			8:45 - an hour before kick-off. We got a taxi to the ground and were 
			dropped outside the ground at 9:10.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Getting into the ground was all a bit chaotic. The ground only holds 
			10,000 but only has one entrance with about 8 turnstiles. Everyone 
			was trying to squeeze through one narrow entrance and the huge number 
			of police there seemed to be making things worse. Despite the 
			queues, we did get into the ground on time and were stood together 
			just in time for kick-off. England won the game fairly comfortably 5 
			- 0. Inside the ground the policing was as bad as it had been 
			outside with 100's of police, mostly in full riot gear stood in 
			front of about 800 England fans who did not show any signs at all of 
			causing any trouble. Just going to the toilets involved going 
			through lines of police and being searched in both directions. They 
			inevitably held the England fans in the ground after the final 
			whistle but it was not for too long and we managed to get out by 
			about 11:45.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			As soon as we got out of the ground, we managed to get a taxi to 
			take us back into the centre. We returned to the&nbsp; same pub that 
			we had been to for our first drink of the day before returning to 
			the hotel just after 2am.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th September </span>We had breakfast at 9:30 and were collected for our 
			tour at 11:15.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We were picked up by a car and driven for about 25 
			minutes to Milestii Mici, home of the "State Enterprise Quality 
			Wines Industrial Complex". This is in the Guinness Book of Records 
			as being the largest wine collection in the world. Wine is produced 
			here and it is home to 1.5 million bottles stored in 200km of 
			underground tunnels. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">The tour involved driving round 4km of the 
			tunnels with a guide. The tunnels and collections were pretty 
			spectacular and the whole trip was well worth doing. It took about 
			an hour to get round and we then had about 30 minutes in the tasting 
			room. We could of done with longer here as there was still plenty of 
			wine left when we were told we had to leave. We bought a couple of 
			bottles from the gift shop as we left and were driven back to our 
			hotel by about 2pm.
</p>

			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZP9t3uONUtg/UExGC73d12I/AAAAAAAAGAA/OYz1J6KXnZU/s320/IMG_2872.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
By this time, the weather had improved quite a bit so we bought food 
			from a shop near the hotel and spent a few hours sat in the hotel 
			garden drinking the wine that we had just bought. We left the hotel 
			just after 5 and went out for the rest of the evening. We had one 
			beer in "The Carlsberg Pub" while watching Scotland v 
			Serbia, and then had a meal in the slightly more Moldavian restaurant 
			next door to it. After eating, we returned to the terrace bar we had 
			been to yesterday and stayed there until we walked home just before 
			midnight.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th September </span>A fairly uneventful journey home. We checked out of the 
			hotel at 11 and walked to the main road to get a taxi. The taxi to 
			the airport involved us all being a bunch of grapes by the driver 
			for some reason. We were at the airport by 11:30 and the flight back 
			to Munich left on time at 1:00. We had less than an hour in Munich 
			this time and were back in Heathrow on time at 4:30. We drove Steve 
			back to Woking and were back in Kingsclere by 6ish. </p>
