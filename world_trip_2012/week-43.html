                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 18th March
                </span>Our last day of diving in Bonaire. We had planned to go South again today
                but the conditions are still limiting the sites we can dive, and we have enjoyed
                the house reefs so decided to dive more locally instead. We began by driving up
                to 1000 steps for the first dive. This has always been one of our favourite
                sites and was again very good. We saw our fist turtle of the day less than two
                minutes into the dive and spent five minutes with it in the shallows before
                heading North along the reef. We went back to the apartment for breakfast and
                then drove to Dive Inn for more tanks and to dive Calabas for the final time.
                Again we saw three sea-horses, one of which we had not been given directions to.
                The frogfish was still in the same place so we got our last photos of him.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-brcrdmeZRZA/UU8E_HLStMI/AAAAAAAAKhs/6hs46BMLTh4/s320/IMG_8332.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After the second dive, we drove to look at some apartments we had been told
                about and are thinking about as a possibility if we come back to Bonaire.
                Although we have enjoyed our stay here, there have been so many problems with
                the Yacht Club, it is unlikely that we will stay here again. Our third dive was
                at Something Special.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had only really chosen this site so that we could see the frogfish again but
                it ended up being another dive where we spent about an hour with turtles. There
                were three hawksbills at the top of the reef - Turtle 1, Turtle 2 and the one we
                had seen with Turtle 1 a few days ago. We saw a couple of them before we had got
                to the frogfish and saw them again on the way back. After we had left those two,
                we found Turtle 1 so spent about 10 minutes with her and then swapped to
                following the third one back to our starting point. Turtley Terrific!!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few hours of not doing a lot back at the apartment before our final
                dive of this trip at Bari Reef. We went slightly earlier than usual and went
                South for half an hour or so at the start of the dive before getting back to the
                area where the turtles live. We had a bit of a wait but after about 80 minutes
                of the dive, Turtle 1 appeared again. We spent about 20 minutes with her before
                she went under her rock before heading back to the exit point. Just as we were
                getting back to the pier, Turtle 2 appeared so we were able to see her for the
                last time as well before we got out. The late arrival of both turtles meant that
                this dive lasted longer than the one yesterday morning - a new record of 111
                minutes.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks after in the evening. We drove to Captain Don's to collect
                take-away pizzas and ate them at the apartment with the remains of the duty free
                Bacardi that we bought when we left Mexico. Don't really remember going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th March
                </span>We did not have a lot to do today. We were able to get up a bit later
                than we have been when diving and had breakfast at about 10. We ate the leftover
                pizza from last night at about 2:30 before going into Kralendijk again. We
                returned our tanks and weight belts to Yellow Submarine on the way and spent
                five minutes stamping our log books. We had another wander round the souvenir
                shops in Kralendijk and got back to the apartment at about 4:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had arranged a late checkout so were able to stay in the apartment until just
                after 6:00. There were no staff around when we left so we left the keys in the
                room before driving to the airport. There was also no-one to collect the hire
                car at the airport so we left the car in the long stay car-park left the truck
                in the car-park with the keys behind the sun visor. Not an ideal way of doing
                things but it was all quite quick. We checked in without any problems and were
                through immigration by 7:00. Our flight - KLM to Amsterdam - took off a few
                minutes early at 8:30. It took a while to get food and drinks but we had a
                couple of bottles of wine before falling asleep sometime around midnight.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th March
                </span>We landed in Amsterdam at 10:15, slightly early and then had a five hour
                wait for our connecting flight to Bologna. We spent a couple of hours trying to
                sleep in the "Comfort Seats" before heading to the Grand Cafe Amsterdam for
                lunch and a few beers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight to Bologna was on time at 15:10 and we landed in a cold and grey
                Bologna at about 5pm. We got a taxi to the hotel we had booked and were in our
                room by 6:00. We had showers and went straight out to eat. We are staying about
                a 10 minute walk from the main square in Bologna - Piazza Maggiore. We walked
                down to the square which did look pretty spectacular but it was too cold and wet
                to spend a lot of time looking around. We decided to walk back to a restaurant
                near to the hotel and spent a couple of hours in there having pizzas and a few
                bottles of wine. We were back at the hotel by 10 and asleep not long after.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st March
                </span>Met Steve in breakfast. He had arrived last night after we had gone to
                bed. After breakfast, we went to the station to buy tickets and check times for
                our trip to Rimini. We walked from the station back to Piazza Maggiore and also
                went to have a look at the two towers that Bologna is famous for. Mark arrived
                just after midday and we met him as he got off the airport bus. We took him back
                to drop off his bag and then repeated our sight-seeing tour of earlier. This
                time, as well as spending a bit more time looking at everything, we all climbed
                the tallest of the two towers to see the excellent views of the city.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We wandered round the university area looking for somewhere to eat without
                finding anywhere we liked the look of so started heading back towards the hotel.
                We found a restaurant for lunch on the way and had our first drink of the day.
                We left there when it closed and stopped at The Bounty, a vaguely English type
                pub where we got through a three litre tower of Erdinger. We moved on from there
                and went to one more cafe by which time it was 7pm and time to return to the
                same restaurant we ate in last night. We stayed in there for almost four hours
                and were all quite pissed by the time we left.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd March
                </span>Woke up at 5:30 feeling really ill. I had not had that much to drink last
                night compared to some days but had the worst hangover I have had in ages. Roz
                went to breakfast with Mark and Steve while I stayed in bed. We left the hotel
                just after 9:00 and had a 10 minute walk to the station. There was some
                uncertainty about whether or not our train would be running as there are
                assorted strikes taking place in Italy today but our train turned up just about
                on time and left for Rimini at 9:40. We arrived in Rimini at 11:10 and checked
                into our hotel which was over the road from the station. As soon as I was in the
                room, I went back to sleep for an hour as I was still not feeling well.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the hotel at 12:20 and walked out to the sea-front and along to the Rose
                &amp; Crown from where the shuttle buses were leaving for San Marino. We got on
                the 1:00 bus and by 1:20 were back at the station picking up more passengers
                from just outside our hotel! The shuttle buses were pretty well organised. For
                €15 we were taken first to the ground where we collected our tickets and then up
                to the historic centre of San Marino, about 20 minutes away.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WMvqHMzZsek/UU8EtDZaydI/AAAAAAAAKhc/nZ2Q-u-xd20/s320/IMG_8406.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The centre was far nicer than we expected. It was a really scenic area, packed
                with restaurants and bars with superb views all the way back down to Rimini and
                the coast. We went to a restaurant for lunch (although I was still incapable of
                eating by this time) and then walked up towards the castle type thing at the top
                of the hill.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stopped for a drink in a cafe on the way as we were
                able to get a table outside. Here I managed to eat a sandwich and once that had
                gone down with no problems, although still not feeling 100%, I was able to start
                sampling the local beer. We left there and wandered around the parts of the town
                that we had not yet seen before wandering back to the same place for another
                drink. By this time we had to sit inside as the sun had gone down and the
                temperature had dropped dramatically.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the cafe at 7:00 and started making our way back down the hill towards
                where the buses were departing from. We had one more drink in the bar near the
                bus stop and got on a shuttle bus at about 7:45. We were at the ground just
                after 8:00.There was not too much going on outside so after a few minutes we
                went in. Security checks were fairly laid back compared to some grounds and we
                got in quickly without any problems. After a few pictures with the San Marino
                band, we made our way into the stand. We had one of the best views we have ever
                had at an England game, stood up next to the press area. The game was fairly
                predictable with England winning 8 - 0.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After the game, we went straight out to the car park and got on shuttle buses
                back to Rimini. Again, it was all well organised and despite ending up on
                separate buses, we were all away from the ground about 15 minutes after the
                final whistle. The bus that Steve, Roz and I were on dropped us at the station
                but Mark had to walk from the Rose &amp; Crown. By 11:30ish, we were all back in
                a cafe opposite the station. I was totally worn out by this time and after
                another sandwich headed back to the hotel. The other were not far behind.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w6hBNw7lKoc/UU8E6Jf83qI/AAAAAAAAKhk/e8EOAJM1QzQ/s320/IMG_8424.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23rd March
                </span>After a quick breakfast, we checked out off the hotel and walked across
                the road to get the 8:58 train back to Rimini. We arrived in Rimini at 10:20 and
                got a taxi out to the airport. We were on the same flight as Steve back to
                Heathrow and Mark was on the EasyJet flight to Gatwick.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As soon as we got to the airport we found that Mark's flight was delayed due to
                the plane having to be de-iced at Gatwick. Eventually, our flight was also
                delayed meaning we were all due to leave just after 2pm. We had an hour or so in
                the lounge before heading through security and boarding. Theo Walcott was also
                on his way home and I managed to get his autograph as we got the bus out to the
                plane.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight home was uneventful apart from the fact that we spent about 45
                minutes circling Heathrow before landing about 90 minutes late. We had further
                delays getting our luggage but eventually got out of the airport at 4ish. Kim
                met us and drove us back to Woking and then Steve drove us on to Farnborough to
                Aleks and Andi's. From there, Andi took me back to Kingsclere where I collected
                my car and returned to Farnborough. We stayed away from the Wetherspoon's this
                time so did not get as drunk as the last time we were in Farnborough but still
                managed to stay up drinking until about 2am.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 24th March
                </span>We left Aleks and Andi's not long after breakfast and drove back to
                Woking to pick up Steve. Our flight out to Dubrovnik was from Gatwick. It took
                about an hour to drive form Steve's to the place we were leaving the car for the
                next five days. We were taken by bus back to the airport where we printed our
                boarding passes and went through security. By about 12:45 we were in the BA
                lounge again. Mark joined us about 30 minutes later and we had an hour or so in
                there before heading to our slightly delayed flight which took off at about 3pm.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W52T89lFGno/UVBDLQPBaeI/AAAAAAAAKiA/vtnEAi5024E/s320/IMG_8428.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We landed in Dubrovnik at 6ish and after a few problems at the hire car office,
                we picked up the car and headed towards the Montenegro border. We got through
                the border without any problems and were in Kotor by about 8:45. After a couple
                of phone calls, someone came out on a motorbike to meet us and we followed up up
                to the apartment - it is not the sort of place you could find easily on your
                own!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The apartment is very nice with fantastic views across the
                bay.We are not actually in Kotor but in Muo, a small village on the outskirts of
                Kotor, directly opposite the old town of Kotor on the other side of the bay. The
                one problem with the apartment is that it is freezing with no way of heating it.
                It is unseasonably cold over here as well as at home!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove back out to a supermarket to buy food for the next few days. We could
                not find anywhere open to eat so went back to the apartment to eat some of what
                we had just bought before going to bed.</p>
