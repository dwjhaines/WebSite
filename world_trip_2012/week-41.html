                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 4th March
                </span>A very similar day to yesterday. We were on the "Deep Boat" today meaning
                that the first dive of the day was a deeper dive and the boat had more
                experienced divers on it. This dive, at the Duane Wreck was by far the best of
                the four that we did here. The wreck was sitting in about 40m with the top of it
                at about 16m. The visibility was excellent meaning that we could stay slightly
                above the decks to make the dive a bit longer. The wreck was also largely intact
                so it was a lot more spectacular to look at than the one yesterday. Plenty of
                life on the wreck as well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at "Molasses" was similar to the ones
                yesterday. We did this dive with everyone else from the boat as it was a drift
                dive and we would not of been able to find our way back to the boat. We did see
                a turtle on this dive but with 14 divers trying to look at it, it moved away
                pretty quickly.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Once again, we were back in the apartment by 12:00 (due to another 15 minute
                surface interval). We had to go out to buy bread for lunch but did not do a lot
                else for the rest of the day. Roz went to the pool - it was just about warm
                enough - while I watched Villa v Man City. We had a similar evening to the last
                couple but with slightly more alcohol. We had a couple of drinks in the
                apartment and then went back to Tower of Pizza. We had a pitcher of bud with our
                pizza and walked back to the motel where we got through most of a three litre
                box of wine.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th March
                </span>We left the apartment at 10ish and after a couple of stops (dive shop and
                post office), left Key Largo about 15 minutes later. By the time we left, the
                weather had returned to normal and it was a lovely warm, sunny day!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to take the slower Highway 1 to Miami instead of paying to use the
                faster toll road. After about an hour, this was not looking a good move as it
                was a lot slower than expected. We were starting to get concerned about whether
                or not we would get the car back by midday. However, it did get quicker once we
                left Highway 1 and we were able to fill up with petrol and get into the hire car
                return centre at Miami International Airport with two minutes to spare.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked in for our flights to Bonaire via Curacao and spent about 20 minutes
                getting through security. We got into the gate area by about 12:45 to find that
                our first flight had been delayed from 2:30 to 3:30. The waiting area around the
                gates was pretty poor as with a few American airports. There were very limited
                food options and no free Wi-Fi. The flight left at 3:30 and arrived in Curacao
                at about 7:30 local time (1 hour ahead of Miami). We had just over an hour to
                wait in Curacao for the 25 minute flight to Bonaire. This left and arrived on
                time and we were in Bonaire by about 9:15. Getting through immigration was a lot
                quicker than when we have been here before as we were on a much smaller plane
                than when we fly from Amsterdam. Collecting luggage was also a lot quicker and
                we were outside the airport by 9:30. We were met by a taxi at the airport and
                driven to The Yacht Club where we have a room booked for the next two weeks.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                When we arrived at the yacht club we were immediately told that there were
                problems with the pick-up truck we had booked. The truck was there but it had
                been in an accident and the tailgate had been replaced with a wood panel (making
                it unsuitable for getting tanks in and out of the back) and it had no petrol at
                all in it. We were told that both problems would be resolved tomorrow morning.
                However we had booked the truck from today so that we could dive first thing
                tomorrow. After a bit of an argument someone went away to get petrol so that we
                can dive first thing. I am not sure now when the tailgate problem will be sorted
                out.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AoBbeHaAukU/UTzj5CLCelI/AAAAAAAAKYE/ab9XD1haq5g/s320/IMG_7966.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were than shown to our room/apartment which was not the one we had booked. We
                have stayed at the Yacht Club twice before and one of the rooms is ideal when
                diving. It has a back entrance and a small gated area near the rinse tank giving
                us a secure place for storing tanks and dive gear. We had requested this room 10
                months ago and were told that it was available.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">However, we were shown to the room next door which is not
                as good. There was another argument about this but the bloke who showed us to
                the room just told us we would have to speak to the office in the morning and
                was not particularly helpful (in fairness, it was not his fault and there was
                not a lot he could do about it).</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Not a great start to our stay in Bonaire!!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 6th March
                </span>Things were all a bit better today. The truck was ready for us to go for
                our first dive when we got up. The tailgate has been replaced by a piece of
                plywood&nbsp; which, while not ideal, it is just about usable. We will probably
                be able to cope with it as it is while we are here. The room is also OK. Dana,
                who appears to be in charge here, appeared at 11ish and told us that it was
                someone else who had told us we would get room 1 and that it was that persons
                fault. Roz then showed her the e-mail from herself telling us that the room was
                available. She apologised but there is not a lot she can do. As it is, we are
                not that much worse off in the room we are in than the one we had booked but it
                is still annoying the way the whole thing has been handled. On the plus side,
                the room does seem to have a friendly resident cat.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Anyway, despite all of the above, we managed to have a very good days diving. We
                had our "check" dive at Yellow Submarine after we had completed the paperwork
                when the Dive Friends shop opened. We did the second dive at Calabas where we
                managed to find a seahorse but not the frogfish (or the other two seahorses that
                are around). After the second dive we went to the new supermarket that has
                opened since we were last here. There was a huge improvement on the amount of
                things you could buy so we stocked up for the next few days.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_GKCeLASrHA/UTzg05WCTBI/AAAAAAAAKXk/wTVtKKBVZZQ/s320/IMG_7763.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive was at The Cliff but the highlight of the day was on the fourth
                dive at Bari Reef. When we were in Bonaire two years ago, we dived Bari Reef
                nine evenings in a row at about 5:30. Every time, at around 6ish, the same
                turtle would come along from the same direction, spend some time eating, pop up
                to the surface for air and then swim to the same rock where we assume it would
                sleep for the night.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We entered the water at 5:30 tonight not really expecting to see the same turtle
                but 30 minutes into the dive a turtle appeared swimming towards the same area.
                It stopped for food, went up for air and then found a rock to swim under. We are
                not sure if it was the same rock but when we got back, comparing photos proved
                that it was the same turtle. When we were here two years ago, Roz had described
                it as her favourite ever turtle so she was quite excited to see it again. There
                was a second hawksbill as well swimming in a similar direction at the same time.
                I think we will be back to Bari Reef quite regularly over the next couple of
                weeks!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the yacht club by 6:45. We washed our gear and had showers
                before cooking a meal. After the last week or so we decided that a few healthier
                days would be a good idea so we cooked pasta and ate it on our balcony. By the
                time we had finished eating, cleared up and filled in log books it was getting
                on for 10pm - just about time for bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th March
                </span>We had our first trip to the Southern dive sites today. The sites of
                Bonaire are split into three main groups - the house reefs in front of the
                resorts along the centre of the island, the Southern sites to the South of
                these, and the Northern sites to the North! Yesterday as it was a late start we
                stuck to the house reefs which are closest to where we are staying.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wFPWuiHVkxQ/UTzizOj4s8I/AAAAAAAAKX0/O6PEkZqDKP8/s320/IMG_7810.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we go South, we usually follow the same routine. We had collected two tanks
                each last night before the dive centre closed. We were up at 6:30. I loaded up
                the truck while Roz made the sandwiches for breakfast. We were on our way by 7
                and in the water at the first site by 7:30. We dived Salt Pier first which was
                an excellent dive again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had our breakfast during the surface interval and did our second dive
                slightly further South at Tori's Reef. This dive was OK but not as good as it
                has been previous years. After the second dive, we took back our empty tanks to
                Port Bonaire which is just South of the centre and collected full ones. We
                usually then do one of the house reefs before returning to the Yacht Club to
                have our lunch.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Today we had a slight change as I had to get my regs repaired again. The hose
                that I had fitted in Mexico was not working correctly meaning my gauge always
                faced away from me and it was hard to see how much air I had left. I was getting
                fed up with this so took it to Bruce at Carib Inn who told me there was a
                problem with the hose and I had to replace it again. As we were there, we dived
                Calabas II, a site we had not dived before but is right in front of the dive
                shop. This was quite nice and we saw our first turtle of the day. We were back
                at the Yacht Club by 2:30 for a late lunch.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another argument during the afternoon about the tailgate. The piece of
                plywood is already getting annoying. Apparently it will be fixed tomorrow! We
                also had to get our shower hose replaced as that had broken. They must love us
                here - we seem to be constantly complaining about something!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Fourth dive of the day was back to Bari Reef where we saw Roz's turtle again as
                well as the second one we saw yesterday. It seems that there are two turtles
                there now that appear at the same time each night. We had planned to eat out
                tonight but by the time we had washed our gear and done log books, etc, it was
                gone 8:30. Instead, we got a pizza from Pasa Bon Pizza which is only a couple of
                minutes walk from the room and ate on our balcony.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 8th March
                </span>Another trip down South this morning. Our first dive was at the Hilma
                Hooker, a really nice wreck dive, particularly if you get there early in the
                morning before everyone else. Second dive was at "Alice in Wonderland". Here
                there is a second reef running parallel with the first one. The second reef is
                covered in spectacular coral formations and again is an excellent dive. We drove
                back into town to change our tanks and dived at Calabas for the second time.
                This time we found the sea-horse and the frogfish and also had the other two
                sea-horses pointed out to us by a guide. We were back in the room for leftover
                pizza by 2ish.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Someone came to replace the tailgate on our truck as soon as we got back. After
                about an hour, there was a tailgate fitted but it could not be opened. We were
                told that they would find us another truck and this appeared at about 4:00. This
                was a lot better than the first one. It is smaller so it is not so high to get
                tanks on and off the back. The tailgate works and it has a proper tank rack
                which is a lot better for carrying our gear around. It is the sort of truck we
                have always had on previous visits to Bonaire and is a huge improvement on the
                first one.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We dived Bari Reef again at 5:30. It took 40 minutes for Roz's turtle to show up
                but he came eventually and we watched him until he went under his rock again.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another night in and cooked pasta again before doing logbooks and sorting
                out photos, etc.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 9th March
                </span>An earlier start today as we wanted to be back in the apartment by 11:00
                for the football. We got up at 6 and were in the water for our first dive at
                Buddy's Reef by 6:30. It was just getting light as we got in the water. Roz saw
                a turtle as soon as we were in the water and there were plenty of fish
                throughout the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had breakfast back in the room and went straight out
                for the second dive at Andrea II. This site was famous for turtles a few years
                ago but we have not seen many there the last few times we have dived it. We did
                see one in the first few minutes and it was a nice enough dive again anyway.</p>

                We collected more tanks on the way back to the Yacht Club and were in the
                apartment by 10:45. West Brom v Swansea was the live game on Fox Deporte so we
                were able to watch that while following the rest of the football via the
                internet. As soon as the game finished, we drove North to 1000 Steps which has
                always been one of our favourite sites. We saw four turtles on the dive
                including a small green sea turtle sleeping in the shallows as we headed back to
                the beach. We had a late lunch back in the apartment before our usual evening
                dive at Bari Reef. We had a slightly different plan for the dive tonight and
                went a bit earlier but as soon as we hit the reef, we saw the second turtle from
                a couple of days ago. We spent about 30 minutes following it and found where it
                goes to sleep. Turtle number 1 was also around and we also spent time with him
                before he returned to his usual rock. A very good day for turtle spotting!</p>

                For the first time since we got to Bonaire, we went out for a meal tonight. We
                walked to Captain Don's for pizzas. Excellent pizzas but poor service. They did
                miss the drinks from the bill which made up for the poor service!</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 10th March
                </span>Another morning diving the Southern sites. We had another early morning
                dive at Salt Pier which was excellent and then continued South to Sweet Dreams
                We had not dived this site before. The site was OK without being too
                spectacular, typical of the sites in this area.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to Port Bonaire for more tanks and did our
                third dive at Angel City. This is a very good site as you can get out onto the
                second reef again and swim along it until you get to the anchor chains of the
                Hilma Hooker. We spent longer on the outer reef than usual this time before
                following the anchor chains back to the wreck. We spent about 20 minutes
                swimming round the wreck before heading back along the inner reef to the
                starting point. One of my favourite dives on Bonaire.

                We were back at the apartment by 2:00 for lunch. The fourth dive of the day was
                another hour or so with the turtles on Bari Reef mainly with Turtle 2.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We cooked food at the apartment again in the evening and had an early night. At
                about 9:45, the time I was getting into bed, the electric went off and remained
                off for four hours. Without the air-conditioning, it was just about impossible
                to sleep.</p>
