            We were picked up from the villa at 11 and driven to 
			Padang Bai. We were dropped off at the Water Worx dive centre just 
			before 1pm. We left all our luggage there and went to look for 
			somewhere to stay as we had not booked anywhere. The first place we 
			looked at was the hotel we stayed at when we were here on holiday in 
			2008. They had air-con rooms for Rp280,000 so we checked in for four 
			nights. After we collected our luggage, we went out for lunch and 
			then spent a couple of hours sleeping off the effects of last nights 
			rum.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We ate at Puri Rai, a restaurant that we have eaten at a few times 
			when we stayed here before and had a relatively early night.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 16th October </span>
            Two local dives with Water Worx today. We were put in a 
			group with three other divers and were led by Wayan. The first dive 
			was not great. We dived at Jepun and for some reason the water 
			temperature was down to 18<font face="Times New Roman">ยบ<span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif">c in some 
			places. It did warm up a bit in the second half of the dive but this 
			was closer to English diving temperatures than those we have got 
			used to in Indonesia. We did see two sea-horses on the dive but not 
			too much else. We were not that impressed with our guide. People started coming up early due to being cold or 
			low on air and he did not seem to know what was going on...... or if 
			he did, he certainly did not let us know. We stayed down on our own 
			to end the dive but by that time we had covered most of the site 
			anyway.</span></font>
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The second dive was a lot better. David 
			(the owner of Water Worx) came as well so the group could be split up, the water was 
			back to 28ยบc and there was a lot more to see. We saw a total of four 
			octopus and a couple of leaf scorpion fish as well as a lot more 
			fish than there had been on the first dive.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Spent the afternoon back at the hotel, 
			either by the pool or in the room and ate out in the evening at a 
			restaurant that we first visited about 17 years ago.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 17th October </span>We were on a trip today to two dive sites about 30 
			minutes away by boat - Gili Mimpang and Gili Tepekong. Again we were 
			in a group of five (not the same group as yesterday), and again we 
			were led by Wayan. Also on the boat was Irene, a Swiss instructor. 
			The first dive was at Gili Mimpang. We dived here four years ago 
			and it was one of the best dives we have ever done. We had dived on 
			our own with a guide, we had seen no other divers and had spent 
			about 10 minutes with two mola mola. We were looking for mola mola 
			again this time but did not see any. The currents here were much 
			stronger than before and after moving away from the mola mola area, 
			we tried to make our way round to the other side of the island. This 
			involved pulling ourselves along rocks while fighting a mixture of 
			up and down currents. We think Irene had been sent on the trip to 
			take charge of things like this as Wayan would not of been able to 
			cope! We all got round eventually but the others in the group were 
			either low on air or unhappy with the conditions. They all went up 
			with Wayan leaving us to complete the dive with Irene in the calmer 
			shallows. Despite the currents, the cold water and the lack of mola 
			mola, it was an enjoyable dive if not quite up to the standard of 
			the one four years ago.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Having seen the problems on the first dive, Irene decided the 
			conditions were not suitable for us all to be diving at Gili 
			Tepekong so we headed back and dived near to where we did the second 
			dive yesterday. This dive was also quite enjoyable and we finally 
			saw a turtle after thirty-five consecutive dives without one! Roz 
			also managed to spot a Pegasus Sea-moth.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5amqG1OkHGU/UH_9Ej4bPsI/AAAAAAAAHGE/iiRpbi73tnk/s320/IMG_4863.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We ate lunch at the dive centre before going out for a walk around 
			Padang Bai. We successfully took money out of a cash-point, I got my 
			hair cut and we started asking around about transport options for 
			the next couple of days. We had always planned to go across to Gili 
			Air for a few days. This is an island about 90 minutes away by the 
			fast, expensive boat or about 7 hours away by the cheap ferry 
			option. It is the place we learnt to dive twelve years ago. However, 
			a few people have told us that the diving there is poor and we are 
			starting to wonder if we want the hassle/cost of getting there and 
			back.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			An alternative option is to stay in Padang Bai for an extra 
			couple of days and then go to Amed which is on the way back to 
			Tulamben. We have stayed there before and liked it about six years 
			ago. We asked around for a few prices for different boats but did 
			not really come to any decision. Back at the room we looked into 
			accommodation options in both Gili Air and Amed but still could not 
			decide.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			After log books on our balcony we went out and ate at Puri Rai 
			again. We were back in the room by 9ish and asleep by 10 although I 
			did get up at midnight to listen to the second half of Poland v 
			England.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xjuLgnNvoGk/UIJ0wwH8knI/AAAAAAAAHGo/KwOSV0_HLFw/s320/IMG_4631.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 18th October </span>Two more local dives today. We were with Wayan and one 
			other diver today. Today's sites were easier and Wayan was able to 
			cope without too many problems. The dives were OK without being 
			great. The first dive was a nice enough reef and we saw another 
			turtle (Roz saw two). The second dive was a muck dive but there was 
			not too much to see. Both dives were very cold again but today we 
			had borrowed full length wet-suits which made it a bit more 
			bearable.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Back in the room, we came up with another option as an alternative 
			to Gili Air. We had talked about visiting Ubud for a few days if we 
			got bored of diving. We are not bored of the diving but as we did a 
			lot more than planned in Tulamben, and we are going back to 
			Tulamben, it seems like a reasonable place to go to have a few days 
			out of the water. We both agreed that this was the best thing to do 
			so sent a few e-mails to hotels. We paid our bill at the hotel we 
			are staying in now and booked a car to take us there tomorrow at 
			11:00.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went out and ate chicken sate at Puri Rai for the second night in 
			a row and were back in the room by 8:30. </p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 19th October </span>We had breakfast on our balcony just after 8:00 and 
			then walked down to the dive centre to collect our gear. We had to 
			go back down at 10:00 to pay our bill for the last three days and 
			were picked up from our hotel just before 11:00. It took just over 
			an hour to get to Ubud and by 12:15, we had checked into our hotel.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			Ubud is the "Cultural Heart of Bali". It is packed with art 
			galleries, spas, temples and places for watching traditional 
			dancing. It is also a nice place to spend a few days relaxing and 
			not doing a lot. It is a very busy town that has hundreds of 
			tourists visiting every day but in the middle of all the shops and 
			galleries, etc, there are quiet lanes with really nice hotels. We 
			had booked one of these for three nights and have a room with a 
			balcony overlooking rice fields.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZzDbnAJ-1ek/UIJ6rL_C5XI/AAAAAAAAHG4/ZK3WEE5nxA4/s320/IMG_4670.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We 
			left our stuff in the room and went out to walk round the main 
			streets of the town. We first visited Ubud in 1989 but there is 
			nothing at all that we recognise from then! We walked down the 
			street we are staying on and back up Monkey Forest Road, the main 
			street, stopping for lunch on the way. We had a quick look around 
			the palace that is supposed to be the number one sight here before 
			going back to the hotel for a few hours by the pool and on the 
			balcony. 
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before going out to eat. We 
			found a nice place to eat near where we are staying but the 
			atmosphere of the restaurant was slightly spoiled by the sounds of a 
			pig being slaughtered across the road as we were waiting for our 
			meals. We were both glad we had not ordered pork! We bought a few 
			more drinks from the nearby supermarket (the first we have seen in a 
			month) and returned to drink them on our balcony.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 20th October </span>Of the things to do here, the only thing that we were 
			that interested in was walking round the local rice fields. The 
			scenery here can be spectacular and our guide book has a couple of 3 
			- 4 hour walks starting from the centre. We headed out at about 
			9:40. The walk was all quite pleasant although it was probably too 
			hot to be doing that sort of walk!</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-A2tUVlrhYnU/UISmD6xp8HI/AAAAAAAAHK4/2aOKBDXZVFA/s320/IMG_4879.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
The book said that at one place guides will help you down the steep 
			side of a hill to get to a river and sometimes farmers will charge 
			you to cross their land which all sounded fair enough. When we got 
			to this point, the guide wanted Rp150,000 (the book had said Rp5000 
			was about the right amount to pay). We told him that we did not need 
			a guide and managed to make our own way down the path - it was not 
			that difficult!
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">At the bottom, there was a woman who wanted 
			Rp100,000 for us to use the path along the river. There was no way 
			we were going to pay this so gave up and climbed back up the hill 
			instead. We completed the walk by sticking to the roads and got back 
			into Ubud by 1ish. We had lunch before getting back to the room and 
			after much needed showers, we spent the rest of the afternoon by the 
			pool again.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			In the evening, we managed to avoid the Balinese dancing and found a 
			restaurant showing Spurs v Chelsea instead. We had a couple of beers 
			while watching the game and then returned to our balcony where we 
			got through a couple of bottles of rum while following the rest of 
			the football on the laptop (Swansea 2, Wigan 1). Got to bed sometime 
			around 1:00.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 21st October </span>Did not leave the hotel until we went out for lunch at 
			2ish. We ate at the same place as yesterday and wandered round a 
			couple more sights that were just about on the way back to the 
			hotel.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went out again at 4:30 and walked to the monkey forest. 
			This is an area with a few more temples in a forest with plenty of 
			monkeys. It was just about empty going at this time as most of the 
			day-trippers had left and it was a reasonably nice place to wander 
			around. The temples were quite small but the jungle type setting 
			made it all quite interesting. The monkeys here were quite cute 
			compared to at some places we have been although one did jump on to 
			Roz's shoulder in an attempt to get her camera!</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were late going out to eat as we wanted to find somewhere 
			that would be showing the Sunderland v Newcastle game at 8:30. We 
			were not keen on the place we had been in last night as the food was 
			not great but managed to find somewhere better just round the corner 
			from it. We stayed there until the end of the game and were back in 
			our room by 10:45.</p>
