                </span>
                Overnight, we travelled to Kwatisore Bay. This area, still within the larger
                Cenderawasih Bay is famous for whale sharks. Whale sharks are the worlds biggest
                fish, growing up to 10 - 12m in length. We have only ever seen two, once when we
                were diving and once when we were on the way to a dive site. The two we have
                seen have both been small, about 2.5m and we only had a few minutes with each
                one.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At Cenderawasih, the fishermen fish from floating platforms called bagans. Whale
                sharks started coming up and trying to eat the catch through the fishermen's
                nets. To prevent damage to the nets, the fishermen started feeding the whale
                sharks small fish. They also believe it is lucky if the whale sharks are present
                while they are fishing. It is one of the few places in the world where you are
                almost guaranteed to see the whale sharks and is one of the main reasons we have
                come on this trip.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The day started early again for Cedric as he had to find a bagan where the whale
                sharks were present. Apparently there are a total of about 14 whale sharks in
                the area and they move around the different fishing platforms. Once he had found
                one, at the third attempt, a price was negotiated with the fisherman for us all
                to dive underneath the platform. The fisherman have to stop fishing while we are
                in the water and they also provide the bait fish used to keep the whale sharks
                there. A price of Rp1,600,000 (just over Â£100) was agreed and by 7:30 we were
                able to start diving.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VJHNEzRWyZc/UKW09C2XfZI/AAAAAAAAH9s/GCQ2t5DO-Fc/s320/IMG_5950.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The three dives we did here were excellent. The second in particular was one of
                the best dives we have ever done. On each dive, we got in and stayed under or
                near the bagan while two or three whale sharks circled around us the whole time.
                These were much bigger than the ones we have seen previously. The two that were
                there all of the time were about 5 - 7m and the third one which only appeared
                briefly on the second dive was slightly bigger. There was slight current on the
                first and third dive which made staying near the bagan a bit of an effort but
                there was none at all on the second. We spent almost four hours in total
                watching them - there was hardly any time that we were in the water without at
                least one of them within sight. Definitely one of the highlights of the whole
                trip.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had the option of staying with the whale sharks for a second day but everyone
                agreed that one day was the right amount of time to spend here so we started
                moving again after the third dive. We anchored for the night in a bay and did
                another exploratory night dive. It was OK but a bit of an anticlimax after the
                rest of the days diving.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 13th November
                </span>Four more dives today. The diving in Cenderawasih is not as good as in
                some places we have been recently. The reason to come here is to see the whale
                sharks. The dive guides do not know the other sites as they have not been here
                before and do not really know which are the best places to dive. The first dive
                at "Weka's Surprise" was another ridge similar to the ones two days ago. This
                site was probably quite nice once but a lot of the coral was dead due to the
                large numbers of crown of thorns all over it.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We moved on to Mangguar Point which was a lot better and stayed there for the
                rest of the day. Dives two and three were around a small group of islands and
                were very good dives with plenty of fish and lots of nice coral. The night dive
                was in the sheltered bay and was OK without being too spectacular.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 14th November
                </span>The first dive today was a muck dive but there was not a lot to see. The
                second dive was better. As well as a decent reef, we saw two turtles - both very
                scared of divers - and a white-tip reef shark. Third dive started at the wreck
                of a small Japanese plane. Again, the reef was OK in places and there were a few
                fish to see. The night dive was better than usual. There were just three of us
                doing the night dive tonight - numbers have been dropping each evening - but it
                was probably the best one of the trip. Still not particularly brilliant but
                there were enough crabs and shrimps around to make it worth doing.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 15th November
                </span>Two dives today to complete the diving for this trip. We did two dives
                at the same site at Waimundi Island. Both dives were excellent - really nice
                hard coral formations again and plenty to see. Over the two dives we saw a
                turtle, an eagle ray, a black-tip reef shark and a school of 15 bump-heads.
                There were plenty of schools of fish around, hardly any current and both dives
                were very enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had finished the second dive by midday. Time to wash all the gear and hang it
                up to dry while we begun the nine hour trip back to Manokwari. Did not do too
                much during the trip back. As we got closer to Manokwari we were able to get
                mobile phone coverage for the first time in almost a week and were finally able
                to find out last Saturday's football results.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, Joey put her photos on the television in the saloon so we had a
                few hours in there while drinking another bottle of rum. Most people had gone to
                bed by about 9:30. We finished the remainder of our rum in our cabin before
                going to sleep about an hour later.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 16th November
                </span>Woke up in the harbour at Manokwari to find it was raining heavily. The
                weather on this trip has been OK but there have been a few days of rain or
                cloud. All the other group were flying out of Manokwari this morning but we have
                a night here before flying out tomorrow. We said goodbye to everyone at 8:00 and
                had a few hours waiting on the boat before Cedric called for a taxi to take us
                to our hotel. We had booked a night at the Swiss-Belhotel and Cedric came with
                us to the hotel at about 11:00. We were pleased to find that we had free Wi-Fi
                included. There is not a lot to do in Manokwari. The only reason we are staying
                here is that the flights to Makassar were cheaper if we fly tomorrow. It was
                quite nice to be able to spend most of the day in an air-conditioned room
                catching up with e-mail, etc after 10 days on the boat.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did go out for a walk around Manokwari for an hour or so. We tried to
                reconfirm tomorrow's flights at the Batavia office but the woman there did not
                seem to know what we were talking about. We stopped for lunch and bought a few
                things from the supermarket next to the hotel. I went for a 5km run in the hotel
                gym but that was about all we did all day.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to eat at the KFC next to the hotel in the evening. It had been
                raining on and off all day and we could not be bothered to walk any further. We
                met Cedric there, ate with him and returned to the hotel bar for a drink
                (non-alcoholic as Manokwari is completely dry). We said our good-byes again and
                were back in the room by 9:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 17th November
                </span>We were up at 5:00 as we had to get a 7:00 flight to Makassar. We had
                booked the taxi that bought us to the hotel to pick us up again but he was
                no-where to be seen at 5:30. I phoned him and it sounded as if he had just woken
                up but we managed to get another taxi for the same price and were still at the
                airport by 6:00. We checked in without any problems and then had about an hour
                to wait in one of the smallest airports we have ever been to.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight was only a few minutes late leaving and we arrived in Makassar just
                about on time at about 9:30. We got a taxi into the centre of the city where we
                had booked a hotel for the night. Makassar is another place without a lot to see
                or do but we fly out of Indonesia from here tomorrow and it is not too bad a
                place for a one night stop-over. We went out for a walk after checking into the
                hotel.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3Kubj0NVB6M/UKiGo6jdXyI/AAAAAAAAH-E/PS6L_Km7UOQ/s320/IMG_6140.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We wanted to buy something to drink during the football tonight but although
                beer was widely available, we could not find anywhere selling spirits. There
                were plenty of supermarkets for everything else that we wanted but no sign of
                anything stronger than beer. Makassar is quite strongly Muslim and selling
                alcohol is not really encouraged. We had just about given up when we found a
                Chinese supermarket round the corner from the hotel that sold bottles of vodka.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We went from there to wander round the few attractions of
                the town - a pretty grubby looking sea-front and a Dutch fort that we could not
                be bothered to go and walk round when we got there.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                For the second day running we ended up eating in a KFC due to the weather.
                Makassar seems to be the hottest place we have been so far and after a couple of
                hours of walking we were in need of somewhere with air-conditioning. We were
                back in the hotel by 1:30 and had another afternoon of not doing a lot.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks in the room before going out to eat. We ate at Kios
                Semarang which was recommended in Lonely Planet. This was an excellent place
                with good food, cheap beer and a good atmosphere. There were plenty of
                Indonesians in there drinking as well and they showed Arsenal v Spurs which was
                a bonus. We spent half our time in there talking to a group of locals who were
                all keen to practice their English and we were already quite pissed when we
                left. We returned to the hotel and continued drinking the vodka while listening
                to Soccer Saturday and watching Liverpool v Wigan. Swansea beat Newcastle 2 - 1
                but we only vaguely remember the end of the game. A very enjoyable evening on
                our last night in Indonesia.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 18th November
                </span>Slept for most of the morning and checked out of the hotel at 1pm. We got
                a taxi to the airport and checked in for the 4:15 flight to Kuala Lumpa. This
                had been a very cheap way of leaving Indonesia as the three hour flight with Air
                Asia had only cost us about Â£30 each. The flight was just about on time and we
                landed at LCCT at 7:45. We collected our luggage and walked to the Tune Hotel
                for the second time on this trip. We were both totally worn out by the time we
                got to the hotel - we had been awake for about 22 - 23 hours yesterday. We went
                back to the airport for a McDonalds meal and were in bed by 10:00.</p>
