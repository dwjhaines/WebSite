                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 19th November
                </span>We were up by 7 and walked to the airport to check in for the 9:40 flight
                to Penang. We had roti canai for breakfast at the food centre and before going
                through and waiting at the gate for our flight. It was only a 35 minute flight
                to Penang but we were slightly delayed in taking off and we landed just before
                11:00. After collecting our luggage, we got a taxi into Georgetown and to the
                Bay View Hotel where we had booked a room for a couple of nights. We had a room
                upgrade for some reason so have a very nice room on the 14th floor.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Georgetown is one of only a few places that we will have stayed in each of the
                five times we have have gone travelling for a year or so. We went out for a look
                around after checking in. We walked to the Kontar shopping centre stopping for
                lunch on the way back. I got my hair cut after eating but once again, we did not
                do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We had planned to have a few drinks this
                evening but neither of us felt like drinking so we ate out in Little India and
                had another early night.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 20th November
                </span>A day off travelling today. One of the highlights of staying in Penang is
                the food. We are staying near Little India so it was the usual Roti Canai for
                breakfast. Did not do a lot in the morning - Roz spent a couple of hours by the
                pool while I finished sorting out the photos from the Raja Ampat trip. We went
                out again for lunch at the same Indian restaurant that we had breakfast in.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--gNoZW_Wi8M/UKt6PI1mJjI/AAAAAAAAIZs/S7-V8HSurC8/s320/IMG_6146.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We then spent a couple of hours wandering around some of the sights of
                Georgetown. We had a couple of things to sort out on the way. We booked a
                minibus to Had Yai for tomorrow, posted postcards, went to second hand
                bookshops, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The sights are nothing too spectacular but the whole town is reasonably pleasant
                to wander around. Little India and the Chinese area just about merge into each
                other and there are plenty of colonial buildings to see as you walk around them
                both. We walked out to the fort (which once again we could not be bothered to go
                into) and past the City Hall and Town Hall before returning to the hotel.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent the evening making the most of the cheap phone calls (3p a minute with our
                Malaysian SIM) before going back out to Little India again. For the second night
                running we ate at Sri Ananda Bahwan, the restaurant recommended to us by Angali
                in 2007. Once again, the food was excellent. We had a beer with the meal but it
                was another early night.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th November
                </span>Did not do a lot all morning. The weather was pretty miserable so we
                went out for breakfast but spent the rest of the morning in the room. We checked
                out at 11:45 and had a five minute wait before a car turned up to collect us.
                The car took us to The Swiss Hotel where we had to wait about 15 minutes for our
                minibus to Had Yai, just the other side of the Thai border.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                On the minibus we were told by an Australian that we would only be allowed to
                enter Thailand for 15 days as we were entering via a land border. He did not
                seem to know what he was talking about a lot of the time but as soon as he said
                this, it seemed likely to be true. The minibus spent almost an hour driving
                around Penang looking for his remaining passengers and we finally left the
                island just before 1pm.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a brief stop before the border where a few of us had an argument with the
                driver who wanted us to pay about 20p to get our Thai entry cards typed out. Not
                a huge amount of money but just a rip-off nevertheless. The Aussie bloke kept
                telling us it was a legitimate fee when it clearly wasn't!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At the border, the Thai immigration officials confirmed that we would only be
                allowed into the country for 15 days. This is not the end of the world but means
                a load of hassle. We will almost certainly have to exit Thailand and return to
                Malaysia at some point in December. We had no idea about this rule - when you
                enter Thailand by air you are automatically given 30 days. There was nothing we
                could do about it so we re-boarded the minibus and continued to Had Yai. (We
                told the Aussie we had got 30 days to shut him up)</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got to Had Yai at about 3:30 Thai time and were dropped by the bus station.
                It was raining heavily when we arrived so we got a taxi to the train station
                which is in the area where we want to stay. We checked into the Kings Guest
                House about 5 mins walk from the station and immediately started looking at
                options for our "visa run" to Malaysia. It looks as if we have a choice between
                flying to KL for a day or just going to the border and back in a minibus from
                Lanta, a round trip of about 13 hours. Neither option is particularly appealing!
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out and booked our minibus tickets to Koh Lanta for tomorrow and went
                out again to eat at 7ish. We managed to find the bar/restaurant we ate in last
                time we were in Had Yai but gave the jugs of Chang a miss this time.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st November
                </span>Usually if we travel anywhere in Thailand, we try and use the government
                buses. These are cheaper than privately owned trips and you always know exactly
                what you are getting. Unfortunately on some routes, particularly if you are
                heading out to islands, you are just about forced to use mini-buses.
                Sometimes these are fine but you have to buy tickets from travel agencies and
                they consistently lie to you about what you are buying and journeys always seem
                to take a lot longer than they should. Today's journey was typical.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel just after 8:00 and took our luggage to where we had
                bought the ticket for today's journey to Lanta. We went and got breakfast and
                were back at the office to get on the minibus just before 9:00. We were driven
                to the bus station where we got on another minibus which drove around Had Yai
                for 20 minutes before driving to another travel agent opposite our hotel. At
                9:30 we finally departed. We had been told that we would be taken to Trang where
                we would get another mini-bus to Lanta. At about midday, we went past Trang
                without stopping. We asked the driver where he was going and he said Krabi. We
                had no desire to go to Krabi as it is out of our way and there did not seem to
                be any guarantee there would be any transport to get us to Lanta when we got
                there. The driver turned round briefly and made a couple of phone calls but then
                just told us he was going to Krabi. The other Western tourists on the bus did
                not have a clue where they were going and he could of taken them anywhere so
                they were not much help.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to stay on the bus and get out at the turning for Lanta. At this
                point, we were still about an hour from Krabi but only 37km from Lanta. We were
                stood at the side of the road hoping for a bus while trying to hitch a lift.
                After about 10 minutes someone stopped and gave us a lift to the first ferry
                crossing (there are two short car ferry crossings to get to Lanta). We were not
                sure how far out of his way he went as he could not speak a word of English but
                it was really good of him to stop for us and it meant that we were only about
                8km from where we wanted to go. We walked onto the ferry for the 10 minute
                crossing to Lanta Noi. As we walked off the ferry, one of the first cars off
                stopped and offered us a lift. Again, no English was spoken but we got taken to
                the next ferry and on to Saladan, the main town of Lanta Yai. We were in Saladan
                by 3 which is a lot earlier than we would of been if we had stayed on the bus.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We bought a few things from a supermarket and then got a motorbike taxi to Kaw
                Kwang where we are staying for the next week. We were given an upgraded room
                which is about twice the size of the one we had booked. We were planning to go
                somewhere else for a week when we leave here but as soon as we arrived, we
                started thinking about extending our stay here. After an hour by the pool I went
                for a run along the beach. We are at the end of a bay about 1.5 miles and
                running along the beach is reasonably enjoyable if a bit hot.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were in need of a few drinks after the last couple of days. We had a couple
                on our balcony before eating at Hans' Restaurant, about a 10 minute walk along
                the beach. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and then another in a new
                bar that had opened on the beach about half way back. I only vaguely remember
                leaving there.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd November
                </span>Did not do a lot all morning but walked into Saladan at 1:00 for lunch.
                We stopped to find prices at a couple of dive shops before eating at Lanta
                Seafood. During lunch, we just about worked out what we will do for the next
                couple of weeks. We will try and extend our stay at Kaw Kwang until December
                5th. We will leave early on the 5th and travel down towards the Malaysian border
                (probably by mini-bus again). Once we have left and re-entered Thailand, we will
                start heading North immediately as we want to be on Phi Phi by the 6th. The 5th
                will not be a good day but doing it this way means that only one day is wasted
                and it is a lot cheaper than flying anywhere.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We also decided that we would do three days of diving while we are here. We
                wanted to dive with Lanta Diver who we have dived with before particularly when
                we found out that Anjali is guiding for them again. However, another company are
                offering a three dive trip to Hin Daeng/Hin Muang whereas Lanta Diver only do
                two on their trip. It is a long way to go for two dives so we chose this option
                instead. We booked up three days diving with Kon-Tiki, starting tomorrow before
                walking back to Kaw Kwang. I was not feeling well by the time we got back. Not
                really sure what it was but felt cold and shivery and no energy to do anything.
                I went to bed at about 4 and only got up to eat in the Kaw Kwang restaurant.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23rd November
                </span>Woke up feeling fine which was good news as we were collected to go
                diving at 6:35. It was a pretty good days diving. We were driven to a pier
                just outside Saladan and were on the boat by 7. The boat was quite nice
                with plenty of space. It was inevitably dominated by Swedes but most things in
                Lanta are! Breakfast was served on the boat as we started on the three hour
                forty minute journey to Hin Muang/Hin Daeng.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UskXwNPg598/ULh8cjRr4sI/AAAAAAAAIac/IJplUiT4mdU/s320/IMG_6187.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Hin Muang and Hin Daeng are two rocks near each other South of Lanta. They can
                be two of the best dive sites in Thailand but we have dived them when the
                conditions are rough and they can be very poor dives. Today the conditions were
                as good as we have ever seen them with no current at all. Both dives were very
                easy with plenty of fish.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been a bit concerned about our guide, Lisa, who was about 25 years
                younger than us and a lot less experienced. She tried to get us to end the first
                dive after 30 minutes as one of our group was low on air but managed to send him
                up with someone else so we could stay longer. It is much too far to go for 30
                minute dives! After that everything was fine and we were all kept shallower so
                we could stay down for almost the full hour.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive was at Ko Ha on the way back to Lanta. We dived at Ko Ha 6 which
                we have not dived before. This was a very nice dive again although it was
                starting to get a bit dark towards the end of it. We came up to heavy rain which
                lasted for about half of the journey back.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in Lanta by about 6:40 and back at Kaw Kwang by 7:00. We had quick
                showers before heading out to watch Sunderland play West Brom at 7:45. The bar
                we used to watch football in no longer has the channel but they told us to go to
                D. R. Lanta resort where we could watch it in their bar. We ate at Hans again
                after the football and stopped for another bottle of Sang Som at Nong's bar on
                the way back to Kaw Kwang.</p>

                We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before walking to Hans restaurant

                the Swansea v Liverpool game. We went back to Nong's bar again before getting
