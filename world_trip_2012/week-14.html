<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 27th August </span>We were up by 8ish, paid our bill at the dive centre 
			and left the resort at about 9. We got a tricycle into Moalboal and 
			were dropped at the main road to wait for the bus to Bato on the 
			Southern tip of Cebu. We only had about 15 minutes to wait.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SpM8DU7sNdM/UD3lbMde4uI/AAAAAAAAFtA/nRHOZwgKGcU/s320/IMG_2407.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
The bus 
			was air-conditioned with empty seats so the 80 - 90 minute journey 
			was a lot more comfortable than our previous bus journey. When we 
			got to Bato, it was another 4km by tricycle to Liloan from where the 
			ferries depart to Negros island. We arrived in Liloan at 11:03 so 
			had just missed one ferry and had almost an hour to wait for the next 
			one at midday. It was a 25 minute ferry crossing to Sibulan and 
			another tricycle for the 6km journey into Dumaguete.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We only wanted 
			to stop in Dumaguete to get money from a cash-point, something that 
			went very smoothly. We then got our fourth tricycle of the day to 
			Dauin, 15km away, the place that we were actually heading for. We 
			were dropped at Mike's Beach Resort just after 1pm. All in all, the 
			journey had not been as bad as expected. It took just over four 
			hours and cost a total of P720 - just over £11 - for both of us.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We got sandwiches from the restaurant and spent most of the rest of 
			the afternoon catching up on sleep after the last two relatively 
			late nights. We also had our evening meal in the resort restaurant. 
			The resort is very nice again and we have another nice room. 
			However, it is a bit isolated meaning that we will probably eat most 
			of our meals here but this is not the end of the world as the food 
			seems pretty good so far!</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-I5D95GTmKcA/UD4dPrecZjI/AAAAAAAAFtU/YghZU3_7MdU/s320/IMG_2454.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 28th August </span>Three dives today. The resort is fairly empty at the 
			moment and the only other guests that are divers were having a day off so we were the only customers on the boat. We were guided by Ace, a local dive guide. Most of the sites here are proper muck dives - looking around black sand for odd fish. During the day, we saw several frog fish including one that was swimming - something we 
			have never seen before. We also saw two more flamboyant cuttle fish, a sea-horse and three ghost pipe fish. The bits of reef that we did see had been largely destroyed by last years typhoon but parts of it were OK and there were certainly plenty of fish. Not too bad a day's diving!
			
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			All the sites are close to the resort so, as with Moalboal, there 
			was not much wasted time. We came back to the resort between each 
			dive and were finished for the day before 4pm despite doing three 
			dives of more than 60 minutes. Again, all our meals were at the 
			resort. We did go out for a walk to the centre of Dauin after the 
			third dive but, apart from a market selling animal foodstuff, there 
			was not too much to see. Had another quiet evening and were back in 
			the room by 8:30. Spent a couple of hours editing and sorting out 
			photos from Moalboal.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kqKyrCvbJDo/UD9Nin-7l8I/AAAAAAAAFto/33OdFCUR09g/s320/IMG_2480.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 29th August </span>Today we had a three tank trip to Apo Island. It is 
			about 30 minutes away by boat is is supposed to be some of the best 
			diving in the area. We left Dauin at 9. On the boat was a Korean 
			couple (plus one of their mothers) and a Chinese couple (plus one of 
			their mothers). We were diving on our own with Gabby. The first dive 
			at Chapel was pretty good. A wall dive to start with and then about 
			30 minutes in the shallows over a very scenic hard coral garden. Saw 
			our first turtle of the day and quite a few large sea-snakes.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The second dive at Cogan was also good. Plenty of fish (and a 
			hawksbill turtle) at the start of the dive, then some time watching 
			a big school of jacks. Not quite the same numbers as at Barracuda 
			Point but still good to look at for 5 - 10 minutes. The last 20 
			minutes were swimming around near the boat (our guide today seemed 
			quite keen to get out of the water and leave us to ourselves as soon 
			as possible for some reason). Saw another huge sea-snake and also 
			the smallest Pegasus sea-moth we have ever seen. The third dive was 
			probably the best of the day with some of the most pristine 
			spectacular hard coral we have ever seen. Had three quality turtle 
			sightings.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back by about 4:30 and once again did not do a lot for the 
			rest of the day. There was a bar-b-q fish buffet at the resort 
			restaurant in the evening which was very good but it was another 
			early night.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cZk9bzz8mr0/UD_y7UdjMoI/AAAAAAAAFuA/PSHiAVMIkxs/s320/IMG_2637.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 30th August </span>Three more local dives today and once again, we were 
			the only customers on the boat (the Chinese are not staying here and 
			the Koreans only dive every other day). The dives were very good 
			again and were mainly muck dives. We had another new guide today - 
			Marlon. As with two days ago, there was plenty to see. We saw two 
			more ornate ghost pipe fish on the first dive as well as a sea-horse. 
			The third dive was probably the best. We were looking for octopus - 
			there are supposed to be seven different types at this site. We saw 
			three more flamboyant cuttle fish all in a group and finally found a 
			mimic octopus as we were heading back to the boat at the end of the 
			dive. Roz and I spotted it, not the guide. Only the second one of 
			these we have ever seen.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			A very early end to the diving today as we were back at the resort 
			by 3:15. Had a similar afternoon/evening to the previous ones here.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 31st August </span>Another three tank trip to Apo Island for our last day 
			of diving on this part of the World trip. We were on the boat with 
			the Korean couple again (plus one of their mothers) who just did the 
			first two dives. We were diving with Marlon and the Koreans with 
			Ace, although it was unclear who was with who on the two dives that 
			they did!</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FepVUS0C8tQ/UEN3e222EpI/AAAAAAAAF2o/XMdQa-KY3bY/s320/IMG_2692.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
First dive was excellent. We went in at Rock Point East and swam 
			round the point, ending up at Rock Point West. Found a very 
			photogenic frog fish at about 33m. As we went round the point, at 
			about 10m, we came to an area that seemed to have turtles 
			everywhere. There were five that could be seen at the same time and 
			we also saw another two. They were all sea turtles and were quite 
			laid back about divers so we were able to get close for photos. 
			Second dive was starting from the point that the first ended. The 
			dive was over the same spectacular hard coral that we have seen here 
			before and we spent time with two more turtles (one sea turtle and 
			one hawksbill). The third dive was also very good. It started as a 
			drift dive in quite strong current. Loads of fish around including 
			quite a few giant trevally and big schools of red-tooth trigger fish 
			and pyramid butterfly fish. Once we came out of the current, we were 
			back to the coral and found our final two turtles. Again, it was one 
			sea turtle and one hawksbill. A good dive to 
			end on!
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Back at the resort by 4:30, we washed all our gear and hung it up to 
			dry. Another quiet evening although we did have a few beers - our 
			first alcohol since Sunday. We had a couple on our balcony while 
			doing logbooks and a then few more with tea. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st September </span>We could not dive today as we fly to Hong Kong tomorrow 
			lunchtime. We did not have anything planned for the morning - Roz 
			went to the pool while I finished editing the photos from the last 
			few days of diving. By about 10:30, it had clouded over and 15 
			minutes later it started raining. The rain continued for most of the 
			day. We had planned to go into Dumaguete at 2:00. By 2:30, there was 
			no sign of it easing but we had nothing else to do, so we went for 
			it anyway.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We walked up to the main road and got a jeepney into the centre of Dumaguete. 
			After lunch at "Jollibee's" (a Filipino version of 
			McDonalds) we had a walk around the town. It may of 
			been due to the weather but no-where looked particularly appealing - 
			the town certainly did not seem as nice as Lonely Planet had implied. 
			We had planned to have a few beers but could not find anywhere that 
			we wanted to sit. I did manage to get my haircut. Haircut plus 
			eye-brow, nose and ear trim plus face and neck massage for just 
			under 70p - one of the best haircuts I have ever had!</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We walked out to the main road back to Dauin and did find a 
			reasonable bar for a couple of drinks. We also bought some rum for 
			later tonight before catching a bus back to Dauin. Got back to 
			Mike's just after 6 by which time it had finally stopped raining. We 
			had a few drinks on our balcony and a few more with our meal. We 
			were back on the balcony by 10 to drink the rum while following the 
			Swansea v Sunderland game on the laptop. Only vaguely remember the 
			end of the game which finished 2 - 2.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd September </span>Checked out of Mike's Resort just after 10 and had 
			booked a taxi to the airport, about 20 minutes away. We had not been 
			that impressed when we had arrived here but really enjoyed our stay 
			in the end. The diving has been excellent and although we have had 
			to eat in the same place just about every meal, the food has been 
			very good and it is another place that we would happily come back 
			to.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YJjtTJwBmvQ/UEN12wbe2nI/AAAAAAAAF2g/KUyCdZHZm4I/s320/IMG_2749.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We 
			had a taxi booked to Dumaguete airport for 10:30 and were there by 
			11. We checked in for our Cebu Pacific 
			flights to Hong Kong via Manila without any problems. The flights 
			were both on time and fairly uneventful. We had a couple of hours in 
			Manila airport where we had lunch and got into Hong Kong at 6:40.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">After collecting luggage and getting money out, we got the bus to 
			Hong Kong Island. The bus went all the way from the airport to North 
			Point and the end of its route was about 50m from the Ibis hotel 
			that we had booked some time ago. The hotel room was a bit small but 
			did have very good views of Hong Kong harbour.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had showers and went to eat in a restaurant near the hotel. There 
			is not much English on the menus of the local Chinese restaurants 
			but we managed to get noodle soup and fish ball type meals which 
			were not too bad. We bought a few beers from a 7/11 and returned to 
			the room to drink them.</p>
