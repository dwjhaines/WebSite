<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 8th October </span>We are staying just across the road from the U.S.A.T. Liberty 
			ship wreck. This was an American army transport ship that was torpedoed by the 
			Japanese during World War II and towed to the beach in Bali for 
			unloading. When Mt Agung erupted in 1963, the ship was pushed off 
			the beach and now sits in about 30m of water, a few minutes away 
			from the shore. This is one of the best and easiest wreck dives in 
			the world due to its proximity to the beach and the fact that the 
			top of the wreck is only about 5m deep. It is also one of the most 
			popular so we were up at 6:15 to try and complete the dive before 
			the large number of divers start arriving on day-trips from other 
			parts of Bali.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6vz9eFBW2tc/UHUAtv7dCyI/AAAAAAAAGn0/K-ZKcln4SsY/s320/IMG_4020.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
            We got ready to dive at the dive centre while a porter carried our 
			tanks and BCD's down to the beach. It was a two minute walk down to 
			the entry point. All we had to do was get our gear on and walk into 
			the sea. This was a repeat of the very first dive we did after 
			qualifying almost exactly 12 years ago. We were in the water before 
			7:00 and although there were a few other divers around, the wreck 
			was still reasonably quiet. We had a very enjoyable 75 minute dive 
			before heading back over the road to the resort for breakfast.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			The porter system is quite hard to get used to here. When you get 
			back from a dive, you just leave all your equipment lying on the 
			beach and walk back to the dive centre. There is a co-operative 
			system of dive porters and someone will make sure that your tank 
			gets taken back to where-ever it should go. Although it is often 
			easier to carry the gear yourself, this is how a lot of people in 
			the area make a living and carrying your own stuff is definitely not 
			the done thing. The system seems to work but leaving almost a 
			thousand pounds worth of dive equipment lying on a public beach does 
			not seem right. Traditionally, the porters are female, although this 
			seems to be changing, and seeing an Indonesian girl carry two tanks 
			on her head is also a bit strange!</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_yOX0x6mQeU/UHVRCvf9ILI/AAAAAAAAGuI/oEbl5wVX5vM/s320/IMG_4027.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
            For our second dive, we went to Drop-Off. This involved a 10 minute 
			walk from the dive centre. Our gear was taken by moped so again was 
			waiting for us when we got there (again, the porters know where you 
			want to dive and just leave your gear lying on the beach for you). The start of the dive was delayed 
			as my o-ring was leaking so I had to carry the tank back for a 
			replacement while Roz waited in the water. Again this a very nice 
			dive of just over 70 minutes. For our third dive, we were back at 
			the Liberty. This is the easiest site to get to and the best dive. 
			It was very good again. By the time we were in the water at 4ish, 
			the day-trippers were gone and we just about had the wreck to 
			ourselves. A very good days diving.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Did not do too much for the rest of the day. By the time we had 
			showered and cleaned our equipment after the third dive it was 6:30. 
			We filled out log books and went out to eat at the TWD restaurant 
			about two minutes walk down the road. Back in the room by 8:30.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 9th October </span>
			A similar days diving to yesterday. We did the wreck 
			again at 6:45 - there is such a lot to see there that we can easily 
			dive here a couple of times a day without getting bored. After 
			breakfast, I walked to the TWD Villas which is about 1km away. We 
			can not keep our room beyond Thursday but they are upgrading us to 
			one of their villas. I think the rooms will be very nice but we will 
			lose the convenience of being 20m from the dive centre.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			For the second dive we went to Coral Gardens, which is the site in 
			between the two we dived yesterday. This was a bit boring for the 
			first 10 - 15 minutes but suddenly seemed to get loads better. We 
			found a small mound of tyres and other rubbish that had a huge 
			amount of fish around it. As we left that area there was a black tip 
			reef shark circling around and the amount of fish on the second half 
			of the dive made it probably a better dive than the second one 
			yesterday.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pMfKVwIueew/UHV_uvji9VI/AAAAAAAAGuc/gzm078ITzhA/s320/IMG_4121.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
For the third dive it was back to the Liberty again. This 
			time we headed South from the entry point and spent about 30 minutes 
			swimming over the black sand. Yesterday we had seen a wunderpus on 
			the way to the wreck and the whole area is good for muck diving. Roz 
			managed to find an ornate ghost pipe fish before we got back to the 
			wreck.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			The wreck was excellent again. We only saw a small part of it tonight but you do not need 
			to move around it. You can wait in one spot and watch everything 
			going on around you for ages without needing to go anywhere.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back slightly earlier tonight. We ate at the Safety Stop 
			again and were back by about 9.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dEjcc5fISrY/UHWASK8FvVI/AAAAAAAAGuo/eTMXP-hjIxU/s320/IMG_4220.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 10th October </span>
            We went a bit further afield to dive today. There are a 
			couple of sites about 10 minutes drive from Tulamben that had been 
			recommended to us. We had not dived one of them and the other we had 
			dived once five years ago, so we went with a guide for these dives. 
			The dives were both very good. The first at Kubu was supposed to be 
			a reef dive but was mainly a muck dive.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			The second, at Seraya, was purely a muck 
			dive, spending the whole time over black sand. We saw all the usual 
			stuff - frog fish, ghost pipe fish, leaf scorpion fish, etc - as 
			well as a few things we have never seen before. Wayan, our guide 
			found a hairy shrimp on the first dive causing him much excitement. 
			This is a shrimp that is about 5mm long and was only recently 
			discovered as a new species. He had never seen one before either. On 
			the second we saw boxer crabs which were also new to us.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			For the third dive, we were back to diving un-guided. It as a very 
			similar dive to yesterday afternoon's. We did not see the ghost pipe 
			fish again but did find a ribbon eel.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We ate at the Safety Stop again and once again, we were back by 
			about 9.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P0jPtQ3ZCwM/UHfHmJFKe7I/AAAAAAAAGu4/ZflooZ-kwCA/s320/IMG_4261.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 11th October </span>Three more dives today and a repeat of the dives we did 
			two days ago - i.e. two dives at the wreck again and the one in 
			between at Coral Garden. The wreck dives were both excellent again. 
			We saw fifteen bump-head parrot fish on the first dive. We have 
			rarely seen these except for here and at Sipadan and I don't think 
			we have ever been as close to them as we were this morning.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			At coral 
			garden we returned to the cleaning station at the pile of tyres. The 
			shrimps there will come onto your fingers and clean bits of dead 
			skin from under the nails. They usually clean bits of dead skin and 
			algae from fish but will do the same to your hands in some places. 
			On the third dive, we&nbsp; tried without success to find the frog 
			fish that lives on the wreck. However, we did manage to photograph 
			the two long-nosed hawk fish that we spotted two days ago.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We checked out of our room before the second dive and, after the 
			dive, we were taken by moped to the villas which are about 1km away. 
			The villas are very nice. We have a bedroom with our own bathroom 
			and toilet just outside the room. There is one other bedroom and a 
			huge outdoor living area with tables and chairs. There is a very 
			small plunge pool and a large garden leading down to the sea. We 
			also have the use of a swimming pool in front of the next villa 
			along. It is nicer than the room we have just left but not as 
			convenient for the dive centre. The staff there are happy to take us 
			back and fore on mopeds but we ended up walking down for the third 
			dive as the mopeds did not turn up! It is only a fifteen minute walk 
			so it is not a huge problem.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We walked down to Safety Stop to eat in the evening and were bought 
			back by moped by the dive guides again.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-W6FDaKchtPo/UHvTkrXbAfI/AAAAAAAAGvM/dt-VvAcLHzw/s320/IMG_4399.JPG" width="320"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 12th October </span>We were collected by moped for our usual early morning 
			dive on the wreck. We managed to find the frog fish this time. We 
			were only 120m out when we were looking for it yesterday!! Plenty 
			more bump-heads again - probably about 20 today but none as close as 
			yesterday. Vis was better today than it has been so another very 
			good dive. Second dive was at drop-off. Very nice again - more 
			enjoyable than the first time we did it a few days ago, probably 
			because of the better vis. We had a couple of hours back at the 
			villa before being picked up for the third dive. This time we spent 
			about 40 minutes over the sand before getting to the wreck. Loads to 
			see including two ghost pipe fish and a leaf scorpion fish. This was 
			our longest dive here so far and meant that we had been underwater 
			for more than four hours today.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We walked down into the village to eat at the TWD restaurant and 
			were bought back by moped again.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FE2PMqxu9AQ/UHwKV4KbG7I/AAAAAAAAGvc/fCep3qQfxTo/s320/IMG_4446.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 13th October </span>
            The pick-up was slightly earlier than expected this 
			morning meaning that we were in the water by 6:30. This turned out 
			very well as we found a group of about 30 bump-heads before we got 
			to the wreck. (They all sleep on the wreck and move off as the sun 
			rises). We were able to stay with them for about 20 minutes as they 
			woke up and started moving away. Again, the fact that we were so 
			close to them made this an incredible experience. We did not bother 
			going back to the villa between the first and second dive - we had 
			breakfast at the dive centre resort and stayed by the pool for an 
			hour instead. The second dive was at coral garden again. We went the 
			other way to usual today and covered some of the area between this 
			site and the wreck. There was not so much to see here but we still 
			found three ribbon-eels and saw the black-tip reef shark again so it 
			was still a good dive.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were driven back to the villa just after midday so had a few 
			extra hours until the third dive. The sea had started to get quite 
			rough when we did the second dive and by the time we went in for the 
			third, it was quite an effort to get in and out of the water. We 
			just about managed it and once again it was a very good dive. We did 
			our usual afternoon dive with half on the sand and half on the 
			wreck. The vis was down because of the rougher sea but still saw 
			ghost pipe fish, leaf scorpion fish, a ribbon eel as well as 
			everything on the wreck. Had another close encounter with a 
			bump-head as we were leaving the wreck to complete another very good 
			days diving.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Before going out to eat, we contacted the owner to book a room here 
			at the end of the month for a few more days. The diving has been 
			excellent and there is no way we are going to be able to dive 
			anywhere else for such low prices. We will come back here before 
			going back to Kuta at the end of our stay in Bali. There was a 
			buffet meal at the villa next to ours tonight so we ate there 
			instead of walking into the village. It was supposed to be a bit of 
			a social event but although just about everyone who was diving with 
			TWD was there, no-one was really talking to anyone else so we left 
			after we had eaten and were back at our own villa by 8:30. We phoned 
			Ayla as it is her birthday today but did not do much else for the 
			rest of the evening.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 14th October </span>
            Another early start - we were in the water slightly 
			earlier than yesterday. The dives here seem to get better each day. 
			There were bump-heads everywhere on this dive. We think that due to 
			the rougher sea, there were more of them sheltering on the wreck. 
			There were about 20 hanging around the rudder of the wreck as we got 
			there. We spent about 15 - 20 minutes with them before continuing 
			onto the wreck and be kept meeting others as we swam round. Despite 
			diving the same site 12 times in a week, we are still enjoying it 
			and look forward to coming back in a couple of weeks.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
The conditions today were still bad. Roz had to be helped into 
			and out of the water at the wreck by guides from TWD who were there with other 
			divers. We had planned to do the second dive at Coral Garden but 
			were advised that the waves there would be even bigger so we did 
			Drop-off again instead. This did not really matter and it was 
			another very good dive. This was our last dive here as we leave 
			tomorrow. We washed our equipment back at the dive centre and were 
			taken back to the villa by about 12:30.

<p  class="diary-text">
We spent the afternoon lazing around by the villa. I spent a couple 
			of hours editing photos from the last few days. We walked back to 
			the dive centre to pay our bill for the last nine days. It came to 
			just over $800 for accommodation, diving, transfers, drinks and a 
			repair to Roz's BCD. It is incredible value for where we have been 
			staying and the amount of diving we have done here.
			</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			After walking back to the villa, we had a few drinks on our terrace. 
			There was someone else staying in the other room in our villa 
			tonight so we did not have it all to ourselves but he disappeared at 
			about 7:30. We walked down into the village about an hour later and 
			ate at Safety Stop again. Back at the villa we continued drinking 
			and got through most of a bottle of rum. Got to bed sometime after 
			1am.</p>
