        <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 11th June 
			- France v England</span>
			Left the hotel to look for breakfast at 9 but nothing was open. Went 
			back to the restaurant next to the hostel at 10 and spent an hour 
			getting an omelette each. As with a lot of places in Donetsk, the 
			service is friendly enough but they just can not cope with the 
			number of people here. We got the bus into the centre of town at 
			about 11:30 and spent a bit of time walking around before finding a 
			bar to sit in. We had decided to avoid the main gatherings of 
			England fans and found a place recommended in Lonely Planet - a 
			bar/restaurant whose name roughly translated as "3 Fat Guys". At 
			midday, it was uncomfortably hot sitting outside in the shade so we 
			had to sit inside. This was probably the nicest bar we had found 
			here and also had the cheapest beer and good food. It was never full 
			of football fans but there were plenty from both countries and was a 
			very enjoyable afternoon.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We 
			started making our way to the ground at about 5:30 (K.O. 7:00).&nbsp; 
			It was about a mile walk and although we did see a couple of minor 
			scuffles between some Russian and England fans, all the problems 
			predicted in the media never seemed likely to occur. At the ground 
			we had to split up as, due to the UEFA ticketing system, my ticket 
			involved going in through a different gate to everyone else. I 
			thought I would be in a different part of the ground but are seats 
			were very close and as there were a lot of empty seats we were able 
			to sit together anyway.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jUkKPfZlQoc/T9hF8trjcmI/AAAAAAAAEdM/RNAdE9Ce_0Y/s320/IMG_4097.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">The match was OK without being anything to get too excited about. 
			Both teams seemed happy with the 1 - 1 draw in the end and it was a 
			pretty good result for England. The atmosphere was not great. There 
			were a lot less England fans than usual at tournament games, 
			probably less than 500 French fans and the rest of the crowd seemed 
			to be made up mainly of Russians. We got out of the ground with no 
			problems and walked back to the restaurant next to the hostel where 
			we endured even worse service than this morning but were just about able to 
			get something to eat while watching Ukraine v Sweden. Went straight 
			back to the hostel when this game finished as Mark and Steve have an 
			early start tomorrow.</p>
			
			<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 12th June </span>
			Mark and Steve left at 6ish as they had a flight booked to Kiev. We 
			were travelling overnight by train and will join them tomorrow 
			morning.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We checked out of the hostel just before 11. We did not want to eat 
			in the same place as yesterday so we decided to go out to the train 
			station, collect our tickets, leave our luggage there and then get 
			something to eat. This did not go quite according to plan. We got to 
			the station and found the queue for the tickets. I had already 
			pre-booked the tickets using the Ukrainian Railways website and had 
			a 15 digit Cyrillic alphabet booking reference. In theory, 
			all I had to do was present this at the counter and collect the 
			tickets. The queue moved slowly as each person was dealt with 
			unbelievably inefficiently. I have no idea what some people were 
			doing but some transactions were taking about 20 minutes. Most of 
			the time nothing was being done but once the woman had started one 
			transaction, she could not serve anyone else until it was finished 
			even when it involved the person being served going off to get some 
			other piece of paperwork. When I eventually got to the front of the 
			queue after 75 minutes, it took 40 seconds for them to issue the 
			tickets. It then took us another half an hour to leave our rucksacks 
			in left luggage by which time it was 1:30 and there were no options 
			for eating anywhere near the station. We got the bus back into town 
			and eventually had our breakfast at about 2:30 at the same 
			restaurant we had spent most of yesterday in. </p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MBtgdChYYIc/T9hF-3JGt-I/AAAAAAAAEdM/h80nll1eo4Y/s320/IMG_0992.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">After eating a meal we 
			had another walk around Donetsk and went back to the stadium to take 
			photos. It was still too hot for doing much walking about so by 
			about 4, we bought a few things from a supermarket and got the bus 
			back out to the train station. We had a beer there before collecting 
			our rucksacks, buying a few more drinks and getting on the 19:10 
			overnight train to Kiev.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The train was very nice. We had booked two sleepers in a compartment 
			of four. Probably the best overnight train we have been on but when 
			we got on, it was like getting into a sauna. The train was sat in 
			the sun with no windows open and the air-con not yet turned on. We 
			waited on the platform until just before it departed and it did cool 
			down once the air-con was turned on but it did stay pretty hot. 
			There were loads of other England fans on the train although the two 
			in our compartment were from Wales. They were England supporters and 
			probably disliked Cardiff more than I did!&nbsp; It was a pretty 
			good atmosphere on the train and, despite the heat, we got to sleep 
			by about midnight.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fwWUmPdrB2U/T9ms5zy_TvI/AAAAAAAAEcw/k4ntuPCrp6M/s320/IMG_1017.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 13th June</span>Woke at about 6:30 
			by which time the air-con had been switched off again. The train 
			was due to get into Kiev at 7:28 and I think was only about 10 - 15 
			minutes late. We got the metro to where the apartment was located 
			and once outside, texted Steve and Mark to come an let us in. It 
			was another very good apartment - air-con, televisions, wi-fi, loads 
			of space - and seems complete luxury compared to the accommodation 
			of the last few days. It is also only a 20 minute walk from the 
			stadium where we play our next match on Friday.</p>

<p class="diary-text">After having 
			much-needed showers, we had breakfast and then set off to start our 
			sight-seeing. We got the Metro back into the centre and headed for the main square 
			which is also the main sight in Kiev. Unfortunately, this had been 
			completely taken over by the UEFA fan park and was filled with big 
			screens and loads of stalls promoting Coke, McDonalds, Carlsberg, 
			etc. After managing to get round the park, we walked away from the 
			main square and went to&nbsp; a couple of churches. They were both 
			quite spectacular - plenty of gold domes - and we spent an hour or 
			so wandering around them and climbed the bell tower of the first for 
			good views of the second.</p>

<p class="diary-text">After a couple of hours, interest in sight-seeing was starting to 
			fade and we headed back down to the main square for lunch. We 
			briefly visited the fan park to buy t-shirts and then went&nbsp; for 
			lunch. We went to the place where the next englandfans "event" will 
			be held as we we thought it would be a good idea to visit before 
			that started! We had a couple of drinks there with lunch and had 
			planned to return to the apartment. However, we went to have a look 
			at another couple of bars to see if they would be good for watching 
			the football later, and ended up staying out all day. The second bar 
			we came to was excellent and after sitting outside for one, we went 
			inside to get a good table for the Denmark v Portugal game. We ate 
			in there during the game before getting the metro home. We bought a 
			few bottles of beer on the way and watched Germany v Holland back in 
			the apartment.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 14th June</span>Once we had 
			got up and had breakfast, it was a fairly similar day to yesterday. 
			We went out at about mid-day and got the metro one stop further to 
			the river. There was not a lot of any interest at the river but we 
			wanted to get the funicular railway back up to the centre. This was 
			not as good as we thought it would be as it was totally packed and very hot without any good views. At the top we were back 
			at the second of the two churches we had been to yesterday. 
			</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VsmruJEN5HE/T9sctEpMmMI/AAAAAAAAEgA/sb-_Zi-0cqU/s320/IMG_1054.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We 
			walked to St Andrews Church and the spent an hour or so wandering 
			down the street that has a lot of souvenir&nbsp; stalls. It was all 
			quite pleasant but there was not too much that we haven't seen in 
			every other Eastern European capital city that we have been to.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We made our way back to the centre and walked out to collect our 
			Free Lions from the fans embassy which had been given a very poor 
			location this time. We had lunch in a restaurant near the main 
			square and then went back to the pub that we liked yesterday (Bar Kupidon, a bar with loads of photos of a bear taken in different locations). We had&nbsp; a beer outside again and 
			then went inside for the Italy v Croatia game. Steve went to try and 
			meet friends in the fan park when the game finished while Mark, me and 
			Roz got the metro back. We had a beer by the metro station while 
			watching the first half of Ireland v Spain and returned to the 
			apartment for the second half.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 15th June - Sweden v England </span>
			We were up early this morning to begin our sightseeing as we wanted 
			to visit "Kyevo-Pecherska Lavra", a site with loads of churches and 
			caves containing mummified monks. We wanted to get there early for 
			two reasons - firstly to avoid the crowds and secondly, Lonely 
			Planet said it was free to get in if you arrived before 9am! It took 
			us a while to find the entrance to the cave which was reasonably 
			interesting and then spent an hour or so wandering round some of the 
			churches. We got the metro back to the apartment by midday for 
			snacks and afternoon naps. The game tonight was not due to kick-off 
			until 9:45 so we did not want to go out too early!</p>
			

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NQiQcxM9098/T9y4Y4e_RaI/AAAAAAAAElk/TA_GALDgO4o/s320/IMG_1074.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We left the apartment again at 3 and went to a bar in the local 
			market. We had a few in there and then started to walk towards the 
			ground. We wanted to find somewhere to watch the Ukraine v France 
			game but as we got closer, everywhere seemed to be full or booked 
			out for private parties for the Swedes. It looked as if we were 
			going to have to watch it in an English bar paying London prices for 
			crap beer but managed to get the last table n a local place next 
			door. This was a much better option as it sold the same beer as 
			Kupidon at much cheaper prices. We would of watched the whole game 
			there but, due to the rain delay, we left at the start of the second 
			half, just after 9 and made our way to the ground (kick-off having 
			been moved to 10pm). There was a much better atmosphere at the 
			ground than at the first game despite us being totally outnumbered 
			by the Swedes. It was probably one of the best England games we have 
			ever been to and the win leaves us nicely on course for the 
			quarter-final in Donetsk!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We met up with Dartford Dave and his mate for a couple of beers 
			after the game and got back to the apartment sometime after 2am.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 16th June</span> We checked out of 
			the apartment at midday and got a taxi to the car-hire office in the 
			centre of Kiev. We had thought we would have to go out to the 
			airport but when phoning for directions, they told us we could pick 
			up the car from near to where we were staying. After sorting out the 
			paperwork we were given our car and headed off towards Chernihiv, 
			about 100 miles North of Kiev. We got off to a bad start when the 
			sat-nav tried to take us through the centre of the town which is 
			completely blocked off by the fan park. The sat-nav is just about 
			essential here as all the street names and road signs use the 
			Cyrillic alphabet and, outside of Kiev, not many people speak 
			English. Once we were out of the centre, there were no other major 
			problems and&nbsp; we reached our hotel in Chernihiv just after 3pm.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Nbt5dGQXspQ/T-KZIAky14I/AAAAAAAAEmI/gtsBg7aEFMo/s320/IMG_1105.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We had chosen Chernihiv as there are a few things to see and it has 
			reasonably priced accommodation compared to the host cities. We 
			wandered round the town and out to the park where there are several 
			more gold-domed churches. We were all getting to the stage where we had had 
			just about had enough of these by now but it was a nice enough town 
			to wander around for an hour or so. We went out about 8ish to a 
			restaurant/bar recommended in Lonely Planet and very good meals 
			thanks to a local who translated the whole menu for us. Also tried a 
			few of the local beers while watching the football. The football was 
			far more exciting than expected with both Russia and Poland getting 
			knocked out. A very enjoyable evening.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 17th June</span> We left the hotel by 
			6am as Mark was flying home today and needed to be dropped at the 
			airport by 8. Kiev airport is on the East of the city so was 
			en-route to Poltava, our next destination - an overnight stop on the 
			way back to Donetsk. Steve had done all the driving yesterday so I 
			did the first part of today's trip. About 50km South of Chernihiv, I 
			was stopped for speeding. It is not clear what the speed limit is a 
			lot of the time but I got stopped doing 97km/h we think the limit 
			may have been 80. After showing all my paperwork to one policeman, I 
			was taken to an office on the other side of the road where two 
			others studied my licence. They managed to tell me that I was 
			speeding and that I would be fined but after a few minutes they 
			seemed to get bored and decided I could go. It looked as if they 
			could not be bothered to fill in the paperwork and as I had not 
			offered a bribe, they gave up. The whole thing only took about ten 
			minutes and we got Mark to the airport with plenty of time to spare.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We said our goodbyes to Mark at the airport and the three of us 
			continued to Poltava. The roads here are no-where near as bad as we 
			had been led to believe and after a relatively uneventful journey we 
			arrived in Poltava around midday. We checked in to a hotel that we 
			had booked and spent a couple of hours catching up on sleep. Again 
			we had chosen Poltava because it is not a host city so is reasonably 
			priced.&nbsp; However, it is only about 85 miles from Kharkiv where 
			Holland play Portugal tonight. We had not planned to go to this but 
			a few weeks ago, Steve was able to get cheap tickets so we decided 
			we may as well go along - particularly as there is not a lot else to 
			do between England games.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L_p3ZN7vyKk/T-KXyR8wLzI/AAAAAAAAEl4/ollMInIBHmI/s320/IMG_1125.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We drove out of Poltova just after 3:00 and were in Kharkiv at 5ish. 
			We found somewhere to park about a mile from the ground and walked 
			to the ground to collect our tickets. We then&nbsp; got the metro 
			into the centre. The main square in Kharkiv is one of the biggest in 
			the world and should be worth seeing. However, as with Kiev, the 
			whole square had been taken over by the fan-park. We walked through 
			the fan-park but it was totally packed and particularly unpleasant. 
			The atmosphere was quite good but because of the crowds, we were all 
			keen to get out as soon as we could. We walked down to another 
			square, stopping for pizzas on the way and then got a metro back to 
			the ground. We were in our seats about 45 minutes before kick-off 
			and although in theory, the seats had a "restricted view", we could 
			just about see the whole pitch.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It was the first time Roz and I had been to a tournament game that 
			did not involve England and we did quite enjoy it. The game itself 
			was not bad, particularly the first half. It is a shame that 
			Portugal got through but apart from that it was a good evening out. 
			We were back at the car 20 minutes after the final whistle and on 
			our way before midnight. Got back to the hotel just before 2am - 
			earlier than expected but still a very long day!</p>
