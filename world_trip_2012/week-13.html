<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 20th August </span>Our third visit to Monad Shoal to see the thresher 
			sharks. We had been unsure whether or not to do this for a third 
			time but decided we are unlikely to ever see them again so got up at 
			4:15 for a final time. Although not as good as our first sight of 
			them, it was better than the second visit here. We saw two sharks, 
			one of them in particular was very close to us and stayed around for 
			a few minutes. Definitely worth getting out of bed for! (As the boat 
			left from in front of the dive shop we were in the water earlier 
			than on the other two trips. The dive started at 5:42 - our earliest 
			ever dive)</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ncaISGI6XiY/UDLv5oURw6I/AAAAAAAAFZo/JKXh9Vt-Nf4/s320/IMG_2095.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We were back at the dive centre by 7:30. 
			After breakfast, 
			we checked out of our room at Tepanee and carried our luggage to Blue 
			Corals where we had booked a room for two nights. Our room was not 
			ready so we left our luggage in reception and returned to the dive 
			centre for our final two dives here. The morning dive was to Bugtong, 
			a submerged pinnacle and the afternoon dive was to Deep Rock - 
			probably our favourite of the local sites. Both dives very enjoyable 
			as have been most of them here.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			After the last dive, we washed our gear and walked back to Blue 
			Corals where our room (complete with sea facing balcony) was now 
			ready. About five minutes after checking in, the rain was coming 
			into the balcony at about 45 degrees soaking everything and making 
			our sea view not very pleasant!</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The rain stopped after about an hour and we were able to go for a 
			walk around the island. We bought our souvenir thresher shark fridge 
			magnets and also found a shop selling bottles of coconut flavoured 
			rum. We stopped at Oscars for a beer and then had a few drinks on 
			our balcony. We ate at La Isla Bonita and finished the rum on our 
			balcony by about 11:30.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st August </span>We had breakfast at 8 in Blue Corals and then headed 
			back to the dive centre. We paid our bill both for the extra diving 
			we had done as well as the add-ons for day trips, etc. Also paid our 
			food and drink bill from Oscars for the last eight days. We spent an 
			hour or so sat outside the shop making use of their wi-fi before 
			collecting the rest of our gear and returning to the hotel. </p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qdidsT29gsA/UDYjG9Z16SI/AAAAAAAAFZ4/fbIlNZpIMw8/s320/IMG_2130.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We had lunch at Oscars again and I then spent half of the afternoon 
			trying to fix my plug adaptor which broke when trying to use a 
			Filipino socket. Gave up after about two hours and created a 
			home-made adaptor held together with sticking plasters. Not 
			particularly safe but seems to work!
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Today was our last day in Malapascua. We had a few beers again in 
			the evening starting with one on our balcony. We went for one at 
			Oscar's and then had a few more with our final visit to La Isla 
			Bonita. Once again, we had excellent meals. The food has been one of 
			the highlights of Malapascua, particularly after the week in Tioman.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			I sent another e-mail to British Airways while at Oscar's and by the 
			time we had finished eating, they had moved us on to direct flights 
			from Hong Kong to London and given us a choice of dates. I have no 
			idea why it took so long but they got there in the end.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd August </span>We were up just after 7, finished packing and took our 
			luggage to breakfast. We checked out as soon as we finished eating 
			and walked to the dive centre as they had arranged our transfer back 
			to Cebu. We got the boat from outside the dive centre just after 
			8:30 and were met by a taxi when we got to Maya 30 minutes later. 
			The taxi journey was quite scenic and was an enjoyable drive of 
			about three and a half hours. We got the driver to stop at a cash 
			point in Cebu City before dropping us off at the Southern bus 
			terminal.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			As soon as we got out of the taxi, we were put onto a local bus 
			heading for Moalboal. We took the last two seats so the bus pulled 
			out immediately. The bus journey was just under three hours. It was 
			not too bad at times but was very crowded for about an hour in the 
			middle of the journey and was very hot when it rained as everyone 
			shut the windows. We ended up in Moalboal earlier than expected at 
			about 3:30, and 
			got a motor tricycle out to Panagsama Beach where we had booked five 
			nights at the Quo Vadis Dive Resort. We checked in and were shown to 
			a room about 10 - 15m from the dive 
			centre. The beach here got completely washed away by a typhoon quite 
			a long time ago but the room we have is only a few metres from the 
			sea and is in an excellent location.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went for a walk around the Panagsama area - plenty of dive shops, 
			resorts, bars and restaurants. It seems a very nice place and I 
			think we have made the right decision coming here instead of Bohol 
			as originally planned. After watching the sunset from our balcony 
			and having showers, we went out for a pizza at one of the nearby 
			restaurants. Very good meals again. We had another drink on our 
			balcony when we got back (bottles of rum coast 80 peso - about 
			Â£1.25) but were still in bed fairly early as we will dive again 
			tomorrow.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 23rd August </span>First days diving with Visaya Divers, the dive centre 
			based in our resort. We were at the dive centre by 8:30 to fill out 
			the paperwork and show our cards, etc. We walked out to the boat and 
			had a 20 minute journey to Pescador Island, one of the best dive 
			sites in The Philippines. We dived in a group of four, led by Dhodho. 
			There was only one other diver on the boat so we all had plenty of 
			space.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eFk5cRIONM0/UDeYCVdCC8I/AAAAAAAAFaM/YVcvi1Fp-54/s320/IMG_2223.JPG"></a></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
Before we went down, it was obvious that the vis was better than 
			anything we have experienced for a while. Once we went down, we must 
			of been able to see for 40 - 50 metres. There were lots of schools 
			of fish, 
			particularly at the start of the dive - certainly a lot more than at 
			Malapascua. Our second dive of the day was another spectacular wall 
			dive at Tongo, about 5 minutes away from the dive centre. On this 
			dive we saw two turtles, the first we have seen since our arrival in 
			The Philippines.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The third dive of the day at 5pm was the house reef. This involved 
			walking over to the dive centre, putting on our gear and walking 
			straight into the sea. Within a few minutes, we were at the top of 
			the wall looking at another turtle. We saw five in total on this 
			dive which was probably the best of the day. We dived with Roly and 
			one other diver and were underwater for 86 minutes.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			So far we have been really impressed with the diving here. Not only 
			is the diving itself pretty good but because everything is close by, 
			the whole day is not taken up by two hours of diving as was the case 
			with Tioman and to some extent Malapascua. We were back at the 
			resort for two and a half hours between the first and second dives 
			(meaning I had time to go into Moalboal and buy a new plug adaptor 
			for the laptop). The house reef is far better than we were expecting 
			it to be and we can be diving there within about 10 minutes of 
			leaving our room. Also, the dive guides seem happy to just about let 
			you do what you want, so you can swim off and look at things or 
			spend as long as you want taking photos without them being too 
			concerned. They also allow very long dives which is ideal.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we were back from the third dive, it was gone 7. We had 
			a couple of drinks on the balcony while writing log books and went 
			out for another pizza.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0iyHD3KFQt0/UDs8BKF-NyI/AAAAAAAAFkc/DPE7wULbjJI/s320/IMG_2245.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 24th August </span>Another very enjoyable days diving. We did not go to 
			Pescador today but did two boat dives about 10 minutes up the coast 
			and the house reef again. The dives along the coast are all quite 
			similar. They are all spectacular wall dives with great vis and 
			plenty to see. The first five at Lo-ok was led by Dhodho again with 
			us and about six other divers of varying levels of experience. 
			Although the group was big, once again it meant that we could just 
			about dive on our own. We managed to see seven turtles on this dive 
			which is the second most that we have ever seen on a single dive 
			away from the Sipadan area. There were none on the next dive at 
			Tuble but it was still a nice enough site. For the third dive, we 
			were allowed to dive the house reef on our own. This was another 
			good dive. I spotted the first turtle before we had descended as I 
			was looking for the drop-off. We quickly went down and stayed with 
			it for a few minutes before it headed off into the shallows. We saw 
			one more during the dive and again, loads of pipe fish.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Had a similar evening to yesterday except that we went slightly 
			further away to eat and had curries instead of pizza.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fhz697TQa_A/UDs5hta1rvI/AAAAAAAAFkM/YhhPMXxHbJI/s320/IMG_2313.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th August </span>Three more dives. The first was the same dive at 
			Pescador island as we did two days ago. I thought this dive was 
			better than the first time we were here - there was more sun and 
			everything seemed a lot more colourful. The second dive was at 
			Talisay, the site next to House Reef. Another wall spectacular wall 
			dive and we saw another three turtles. The final dive of the day was 
			on the house reef again. Tonight we were led by Dhodho and went 
			North for the first time. Another 80 minute dive and we saw ten 
			turtles - a new record apart from dives at Sipidan! Also saw a 
			"hairy octopus" for the first time.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			As usual, we had a couple of drinks on our balcony while doing our 
			log books. Swansea v West Ham kicked off at 7:45 local time and we 
			were able to get commentary through the laptop. We listened to the 
			first 15 minutes and then went out to eat. If we had been just about 
			anywhere else in S. E. Asia, we would be able to watch this game but 
			The Philippines is not big on English football...... or any 
			non-American sport. We were back on the balcony to listen to the 
			second half (Swansea 3 - West Ham 0). Sunderland's game got called 
			off due to the rain so there was not too much interest in the rest 
			of the afternoons football. We had a few more drinks and went to bed 
			after the final scores had gone through.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 26th August </span>Just two dives today as we want to dry our gear before 
			we leave tomorrow. We had planned to have a day off diving but it 
			has been so good here that we did not want to miss out on another 
			couple of dives. Also, by doing a tenth dive this morning, we get 
			one free this afternoon! The first dive of the day was at Pescador 
			again. We dived a different part of the island this time dropping in 
			at "The Cathedral", a huge crevice in the rock dropping down to 35m. 
			It was a very spectacular part of the dive with a large swim-through 
			at the bottom. The rest of the dive was also very good.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GY4h4k5IdbE/UDtBn3MchPI/AAAAAAAAFks/FK3X1Dr7Sic/s320/IMG_2395.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We finished our diving here with a 90 minute dive along the house 
			reef. We were diving with Dhodho again and one other couple. We were 
			dropped off by boat a few 100m along from where we are staying. The 
			other couple were low on air after about 40 mins and got back on the 
			boat leaving us to swim back to the dive centre. We saw four 
			or five turtles in the same place we had seen a lot of them last 
			night.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The diving here has been excellent - probably better than we 
			expected it to be. Lots of turtles and very long dive times - we 
			have averaged just over 73 minutes per dive. This is another place 
			we want to come back to!</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had finished washing our gear by about 4:00 and did not do a lot 
			else for the rest of the afternoon. We had a similar evening to 
			yesterday (without the football), i.e. a few beers on the balcony 
			before going out for a pizza. We ate with Kari, the Finn who we 
			dived with on our first evening dive here and his girlfriend, and 
			then returned to our balcony to finish a bottle of rum.</p>
