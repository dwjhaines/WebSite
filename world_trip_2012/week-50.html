                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 6th May
                </span>We had a later breakfast this morning and then had a couple of hours
                watching the rain from our balcony. We packed up all our gear and checked out of
                the resort just after 11:00. The week here has gone very quickly. It has been an
                excellent place to stay - the room was really nice, the food good and the diving
                has been brilliant. We have also been lucky with the weather. I think it was
                poor the week before we arrived and this morning is the first really heavy rain
                we have seen.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were at the airport by 11:15 and checked in very easily. Usually small
                Indonesian airports are very chaotic but we went straight to the desk and had
                our boarding passes within a few minutes. We somehow managed to get away without
                paying excess luggage charges as well which was good news. The Lion Air flight
                left on time at 12:45 for the two and a half hour journey to Surabaya where we
                had a connection to Bali. We had a two and a half hour wait in Surabaya which
                went pretty quickly as we had proper internet access for the first time in over
                a week. We were able to upload pictures, update the diary and generally catch up
                on what has been happening in the last week.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SkFlA9xBawY/UY-eUzrf3gI/AAAAAAAALls/eF35dnbHkvw/s320/IMG_0039.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a one hour flight from Surabaya to Bali. This was a very enjoyable flight
                as we had excellent views of Java's volcanoes for most of the journey. We
                arrived in Dempasar on time at 6:30, spent about half an hour getting through
                the airport and were met by a taxi driver from the hotel we had booked. We were
                at the hotel on Poppies I in Kuta by 7:30 and after a bit of confusion about the
                reservation were in our room about 10 minutes later.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We dumped our luggage in the room and went straight out to stock up on a few
                things we needed. Kuta has some big supermarkets and we will not be near another
                one for a few weeks. We walked back to the room&nbsp; and had showers before
                going out to eat. One of the reasons we were keen on staying in Kuta tonight is
                so we could go back to the Italian restaurant we had eaten in a few times in
                November. However, when we got to it, it had been completely renovated, did not
                look anywhere near as good as it did before and was not due to reopen until
                Friday. We walked back to Bamboo Corner, another restaurant we have eaten in a
                few times over the years and ate there instead. We went for a couple of beers in
                Bali Agung after eating and were back in the room by 10:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th May
                </span>While in Ambon, we had used the internet to book a ferry ticket to Gili
                Air for this morning that included pick-up from Kuta. We were a bit unsure about
                how well this would work but everything went pretty smoothly. We were collected
                at 7:45 and, after collecting two more passengers, were driven to the ferry
                pier. We checked in and had breakfast before leaving on time at 9:00. The
                journey was quite enjoyable. The boat was half empty and the journey quite
                scenic as we called into Padang Bai and Lombok before getting to Gili Air.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-inN2IFDnet8/UY-Z7oZDfcI/AAAAAAAALlY/bPBRlMJ9Qn4/s320/IMG_0064.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Gili Air is where we learnt to dive nearly thirteen years ago and this is the
                first time we have been back since. It is another place that is not a great
                diving destination but is a nice island to stay for a few days and the diving is
                still OK. We had decided to dive with "Oceans 5" and found the dive centre by
                the jetty as soon as we got off the boat just before midday. We had not booked
                anywhere to stay but they had rooms behind the dive centre which were nice
                enough so we took one of those for four days. The room is about the quarter of
                the size of the one we had in Ambon but has air-conditioning and will be fine
                for four days.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a bit of time by the pool but with the temperature at around 40ºc, we
                could not stay there for long! We decided that we would do one dive this
                afternoon. There is a house reef right in front of the resort and at around 2:30
                we walked into the water with Hamdi our guide. Things got off to a bad start as
                Roz noticed drops of water on the inside of her camera housing after a few
                minutes of the dive. We surfaced immediately&nbsp; and I took the camera back to
                the room before we continued the dive. The dive was better than we were
                expecting. Not quite up to the standards of Ambon but a few things to see and
                better coral than we thought there would be.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the room after the dive and there does not appear to be any
                damage to Roz's camera. At 5ish, we went for a walk around part of the island.
                It is only a couple of miles all the way round. The area we stayed in 13 years
                ago (and 18 years ago) is totally unrecognisable. The dive centre has been
                knocked down and re-built, the rooms we stayed in have gone and there are loads
                more restaurants and resorts there. It is still very nice and it is no-where
                near being over developed yet.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had showers when we got back and then went out to eat. We had seen somewhere
                that did pizzas while we were out so went and ate there as we had missed out
                last night. Really good food while overlooking the sea. Back in the room by
                9ish.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 8th May
                </span>We had chosen to dive with Oceans 5 as they do two morning dives as
                opposed to most of the operators here that go out at 8:30 and 2:30. Here they
                have an additional dive at 11:30 so we can do two dives and be finished by
                lunchtime. We were diving on our own with Hamdy again today. We appear to be the
                only fun divers here but there were quite a few other divers on the boat for
                both of today's dives. There are a lot of students here from OW to IDC but the
                boat still had plenty of space and was pretty comfortable.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OL2qubZWkLU/UY-l3THV9tI/AAAAAAAALmI/KZcUBG2RNO8/s320/IMG_0115.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had said when we arrived that we would like to see turtles here and on the
                first dive at Shark Point we saw 13 or 14. They were mainly green turtles but
                there were three hawksbills as well. The visibility was excellent and it was a
                really enjoyable dive. I saw a black-tip reef shark while on the safety stop
                although Roz missed it as she was still busy looking at turtles. The second dive
                at Han's Reef was also good. Only three turtles, all together on the same
                pinnacle, but we also saw a leaf scorpion fish and a ribbon eel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the resort by 1:30. We had take-aways for lunch by which time it
                had clouded over so spent a couple of hours editing photos in the room. After
                the second dive we had been asked if we wanted to help with a beach clean-up at
                4pm. We had agreed thinking that we would be collecting rubbish from the beach
                but it turned out to be a dive to collect rubbish from the house reef. There
                were about eight of us, mainly the Oceans 5 staff, all with sacks which we
                filled in just under an hour underwater. Despite the fact that we were
                collecting rubbish, it was a free dive and still quite enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After the dive we went to the resort bar to do our log books. After a couple of
                drinks there, we went out to eat then had a couple more drinks on our balcony
                before getting to bed at about 10:30.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fCH51QZ2hwI/UY-hwJDtRwI/AAAAAAAALl4/zR78YHjYYI0/s320/IMG_0162.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 9th May
                </span>Two more dives today, both at sites just off Gili Trawangen. We went to
                Shark Point again for the first dive and again saw plenty of turtles Roz counted
                ten this time.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                At the start of the dive we went down to about 30m looking for sharks and had an
                eagle ray swimming around us for a few minutes. The second dive was at Sunset
                Point where again we were looking for sharks. This was another very good site
                for turtles - 9 this time - and we also saw something that we both thought was a
                ghost pipe fish but is apparently a leaf pipe fish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back by 1:30 and did not do too much for the rest of the day. We bought
                our boat tickets for the journey back to Bali on Saturday and went out for
                pizzas again in the evening.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 10th May
                </span>The same two dive sites today as yesterday. Saw two sharks on each of the
                dives and another 19 turtles in total. On the first dive, we had a rescue a
                giant grouper that had become hooked on fishing line at about 28m. This involved
                putting my hand down its throat and trying to dislodge the hook while Hamdi held
                it. After a few minutes of trying, I could not get it out but Hamdi eventually
                managed to free it. All this was taking place at 28m in current so we used up
                air and bottom time more quickly than usual but still got a 55 minute dive. We
                saw one white-tip swimming around in the deep and another smaller one under a
                rock higher up. Not so easy to get pictures of turtles due to the current and
                surge but still an enjoyable dive.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zRVjtDhaeuA/UY-pxOVUadI/AAAAAAAALmU/MyuaRxt-Urc/s320/IMG_0172.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive had plenty of turtles again. I think we have seen more
                hawksbills on this site than anywhere we have ever dived. Only one of the
                turtles we saw on this dive was a green turtle, the other six all hawksbills.
                Lots of other divers on this dive but still managed to have two sharks swimming
                fairly close to us. It was quite sad seeing the amount of destruction caused by
                dynamite fishing at the end of the dive. Some of the reef is in very good
                condition but the majority of it is totally wrecked.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                This was our last dive here and we have been reasonably impressed. The highlight
                has definitely been the large numbers of turtles and the superb visibility.
                Without those, the dives would not have been that good but it has been well
                worth coming over here for a few days.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did not get back to the resort until 4ish as the second dive was later today
                (due to Friday prayers). We had a couple of drinks on our balcony while doing
                our logbooks again and then went out to eat at the same place as we ate two
                nights ago. After eating, we returned to the balcony and got through about a
                bottle and a half of the rum we had bought in Kuta.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th May
                </span>We were up at 8 and hung our wet gear in the sun before going to
                breakfast. Everything was just about dry by the time we had to pack it up and
                check out at 10:00. Our boat was supposed to leave at 10:30 but did not turn up
                until after 11:00. It then waited about 15 minutes at Lombok and we eventually
                got to Amed at about 12:30, an hour later than scheduled. A driver from Tulamben
                Wreck Divers was there to meet us and take us to Tulamben.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            <p class="diary-text">We got to the dive centre just after 1:00. Our room was not ready when we
            arrived but was by the time we had been out for lunch. The rooms we had tried to
            book were all full for this week so we had been upgraded to one of the first
            floor rooms which is probably the best room in the resort. We have loads of
            space again and a balcony from which you can see the sea. It also has a back
            window from which we would be able to see Agung if it were not in cloud. The
            only downside to the room is that the Wi-Fi is not working and it seems
            uncertain when this will be fixed. Not good news for this weekends football.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for our first dive on the wreck just after 4:00. We did a similar dive
                to the ones we used to do at this time when we were here last year i.e. 40
                minutes on the black sand before getting to the wreck, and then 40 minutes on
                the wreck itself. We managed to find a leaf scorpion fish, ribbon eels, lots of
                mantis shrimps and a couple of long nosed hawk fish. No sign of the ghost pipe
                fish that always seemed to be around last year but we will try again for those
                tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We only spent about 30 minutes back at the room before going out for a second
                dive. This was the first time we have done an unguided night dive here. It was
                not as good as the first dive. There were a few bump-head parrot fish around but
                not too much of any note. My computer stopped working after 23 minutes of the
                dive which was not good. Still don't know if it is permanently dead or if
                removing the battery will fix the problem but I will need to borrow tools
                tomorrow to do that.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the room by 8:30ish and after quick showers, went out to eat at
                The Safety Stop. Neither of us could be bothered to stay up and watch the F. A.
                Cup Final which does not kick-off here until after midnight.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th May
                </span>Up at 6 for an early morning dive on the Liberty. We were in the water by
                6:30 but the bump-heads had already left by the time we were at the wreck. We
                did see one swimming around the wreck but when we were here last year, we were
                seeing up to 50 at this time of day. We managed to find a ghost pipe fish as we
                swam to the wreck and towards the end, had the bonus of a hawksbill turtle
                swimming around the rudder area. We have dived at this wreck more than 30 times
                and have never seen a turtle here before.</p>

                We had breakfast back at the hotel and I did then manage to fix my computer by
                removing and replacing the battery. I still don't know if the problem will
                re-occur but it seems OK at the moment. We did the second dive at Coral Garden.
                This was another very good dive due to finding two turtles. There was one large
                hawksbill turtle destroying coral down at about 23m. We watched him for 10
                minutes or so until he went up for air. As we headed back up the reef, we found
                another one coming down, probably the same one we had seen on the wreck earlier.
                We were back at the resort by midday and I spent a few hours sorting out photos
                from Ambon while Roz lay by the pool.</p>

            We did our third dive just after four as usual. This time, it took us nearly an
            hour to get to the wreck as there was so much to see on the sandy area to the
            right of it. We found the leaf scorpion fish from yesterday as well as a second
            one nearby. There were a few nudibranchs in the same area. We were looking for
            ghost pipe fish again when Roz spotted the big turtle we had seen on the
            previous dive. We had more time watching him eat before heading towards the
            wreck. On the way we found a wunderpus and stopped for more photos of the ghost
            pipe fish we had seen this morning. On the wreck there was a large Napoleon
            Wrasse which we swam with for about five minutes. One of the best dives we have
            ever done here!

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did not go out to eat until 9:00 as we wanted to stay up for the football but
                did not want to drink much. We ate in The Safety Stop again. We were going to go
                back to the TWD restaurant to use their Wi-Fi but The Safety Stop was showing
                the football so we stayed in there. We had a couple of beers in there while
                following the football on the internet. We got them to got them to put on the
                Man U v Swansea game at 11:00 but we only watched the first half. Once all the
                other games had finished, we went back to bed.</p>
