<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 2nd July</span> Left the hotel just before 9. The journey to Bruges 
			was slightly longer than I had expected but we were still there by 
			just after midday.&nbsp; We were staying at an Etap Hotel next to 
			the station. The room was tiny but very cheap considering how close 
			it was to the centre of Bruges.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
We went out at 2ish after getting lunch from the station. We did not 
			have a lot planned for our visit to Bruges apart from visiting the 
			bars. The two we were keenest on were De Garr which we had been to 
			before and 't Brugs Beertje which was closed the last time we were 
			here. We walked to&nbsp; 't Brugs Beertje which was closed again but 
			did look as if it would open at 4pm. We then went to De Garr to find 
			that it was closed until July 14th. This seems quite a common thing 
			for bars in Belgium for some reason - they randomly close for a 
			couple of weeks during what should be their busiest time of the 
			year. There were a few other bars listed in our guide book and we 
			headed for De Kuppe which was good enough for a couple of hours. We 
			went back to&nbsp; 't Brugs Beertje at about 4:30 and this was a 
			superb pub. Our guide book rated it as one of the top 12 pubs in the 
			world and it is definitely one of the best we have been to in 
			Belgium. The pub itself was really nice and the beer menu had about 
			400 different beers on it. We stayed in there for at least 5 hours 
			and do not remember leaving!</p>

<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 3rd July</span> We had breakfast at the station and went out on our 
			bikes at about 11:00. We cycled into the centre of Bruges and locked 
			up our bikes before wandering round the main squares and visiting a 
			couple of shops. We then cycled out through Damme to Sluis, a small 
			town just over the Dutch border. It was an easy ride of about 13 
			miles on a totally flat cycle path along the side of a canal. After 
			looking around&nbsp; the town, we had our first beer if the day in 
			the bar recommended in our beer guide. It took just over an hour to 
			cycle back and we were back at our hotel just after 3. This was our 
			final bike ride of the trip, so I packed Roz's bike into the back of 
			the car and left mine unlocked outside the station. It is in very 
			poor condition, needs two new tyres and is not worth carrying home 
			but it was still a sad moment when I left it! 
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			After showers, we went back into Bruges.&nbsp; Both the best bars in 
			Bruges were closed today as 't Brugs Beertje was also shut for the 
			day. We headed out to 't Poatersgat, another bar recommended by both 
			our guide books. This was another very nice place with about 100 
			beers on the menu. We could not be bothered to move from here so 
			spent the whole evening sampling the beers before leaving at about 
			11 in a slightly more sober state than we were in last night. My 
			bike had gone by the time we got back to the station!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 4th July</span> The final day of the first leg of this trip. We left 
			the hotel at 10ish and drove to Dunkirque. We had a couple of stops 
			to buy food and beer on the way and were at the port by about 12:45 
			in time for the 14:00 ferry. The ferry journey was uneventful as was 
			the three hour drive back to Kingsclere. Arrived in a wet Kingsclere 
			not long after 6pm.</p>
