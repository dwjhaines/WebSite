                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 16th </span>After nearly four weeks at home over Christmas 
			and New Year, it was time to begin the next leg of the trip. We had 
			stayed with Alex and Andi in Farnborough overnight and were up at 
			six (after about three hours sleep!) for our lift to a very cold 
			North Camp station. We were at the station by about 6:50 in time for 
			the 6:57 train to Gatwick. We were at Gatwick by 8 and checked in 
			for the 10:00 BA flight to Cancun, Mexico. Before check-in, I 
			realised that I had left the key to my luggage in Farnborough which 
			was not good news (although by the time we got to Cancun, Roz found 
			that she did have a spare). After getting rid of our luggage, we 
			headed to the BA lounge for breakfast. We were on the plane by 9:45 
			but had to wait for the plane to be de-iced so eventually took off 
			at about 10:40.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			The flight was half empty so we had plenty of space to spread out 
			again. We had a few glasses of wine with the first meal and then 
			managed to get a few hours sleep. The flight took about 10 hours and 
			we landed in Cancun at 2:45pm (six hours behind UK time). There were 
			long queues to get through immigration and customs but we were still 
			outside the airport about an hour after landing. We walked to the 
			bus station and got the 16:00 bus to Playa del Carmen where we will 
			be staying for the next four nights. The bus took less than an hour. 
			We walked from the bus station to Hotel Vista Caribe which was where 
			we stayed when we came to Playa four or five years ago.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had to change rooms due to the first one being above the main 
			pedestrian street making it quite noisy. They eventually let us have 
			the one next door which was a lot better. We are staying in one of 
			their apartments again so have a large bedroom and kitchen/living 
			area. We were both pretty worn out by the time we had got everything 
			sorted out and were in need of sleep. We went straight out for a 
			walk around Playa. The dive centre that we have used before was 
			closed and it was not obvious whether or not it was closed 
			permanently. Also, Dr Taco, the restaurant we ate in every night we 
			were here last time had closed which was probably more 
			disappointing! There&nbsp; were loads of other small restaurants and 
			market stalls selling cheap food. We had tacos from a couple of them and 
			walked back to the hotel by about 8:30.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 17th January </span>We were up by 8ish and had the breakfast that 
			is included in the price of the room. We went for a walk round a few 
			dive centres enquiring about diving tomorrow but could not really 
			make up our minds who to dive with. We could not find the Abyss Dive 
			Centre that we had a few recommendations for (it had moved from 
			where it used to be) so we returned to the room and sent them an 
			e-mail. Spent the rest of the morning lying by the pool.</p>

<p  class="diary-text">Just 
			before we went out to lunch, we got an e-mail from a Cuban travel 
			company. We are planning on visiting Cuba in a couple of weeks and 
			had used this company to book our hotel. The e-mail told us that the 
			booking had been unsuccessful despite the fact that we have 
			confirmation and have paid up-front. We sent them an e-mail asking 
			what they would do about it and went out for lunch. We ate&nbsp; at 
			a restaurant we had not been to before (tacos again) mainly due to 
			the tortoise logo! 
		</p>
	
<p  class="diary-text">
			Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon. Back at the room we 
			managed to get in touch with Abyss diving and decided we would dive 
			with them tomorrow.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We also exchanged a few e-mails with Cuba Travel Network. They 
			offered us a newer hotel that did not look anywhere near as good as 
			the one we had originally booked and in a much worse location. Once 
			Roz started complaining, they were suddenly able to confirm our 
			original booking so that panic was over.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we went out to eat it had become quite cold which we 
			were not really expecting here. Not exactly freezing but cold enough 
			to need layers other that t-shirts. We had another very good meal at 
			the same place that we ate last night and had another early night. 
			(We have decided that we are in need of a few alcohol free days 
			after the last week or so at home!)</p>

<p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 18th January </span>After breakfast, we made our way down to the 
			place on the beach where we were due to meet Dave, the owner of 
			Abyss Dive Centre (|They no longer have the shop in Playa which is 
			why we could not find them yesterday!). Dave arrived at about 8:30 
			and after a bit of waiting around, we were on our way to the dive 
			site just before 9:00. We were diving with Dave himself and one 
			other diver. We dived at Tortuga Reef and Sabalos, two sites that we 
			had dived last time we were here. Both dives were very good again. 
			At the first we saw five or six turtles and also had two sightings 
			on a bull shark. We were not that close to it and were not sure if 
			it was the same one twice or not but we were close enough to see it 
			clearly and make out that it was a pretty big shark. We had another 
			very close up view of a large hawksbill turtle at the start of the 
			second dive.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			One of the things we had been asking dive centres about yesterday 
			was the lengths of the dives as this has been an issue in Mexico 
			in the past. Diving with Abyss proved to be a good move as our dive 
			times today were 55 and 66 minutes. We will probably dive with them 
			again later on during our stay in Mexico.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we had got back to the room and started cleaning our 
			gear, Roz was not feeling well. She spent the afternoon in bed 
			feeling either too hot or too cold. The weather was still pretty bad 
			here - it had been freezing on the boat (although not too bad 
			underwater) and certainly not pool or beach weather. Apart from a walk 
			around Playa I also spent most of the afternoon in the room.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Roz was feeling a bit better in the evening and was up to coming 
			out. She was not however, up to eating anything so sat and watched 
			while I ate an "Alhambra" (very similar to tacos again) at El 
			Cahuamo.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 19th January </span>Roz, although still not 100%, was feeling much 
			better when we woke up and was able to eat some breakfast. At 9 we 
			were able to listen to Soccer Saturday on the laptop. Not quite as 
			good a time for listening to football as when we are&nbsp; in S. E. 
			Asia but Swansea and Sunderland both won so it was an enjoyable 
			couple of hours. We went to the beach when the football had finished 
			but it had clouded over by about 12:30 and started to get cold 
			again. By this time, Roz's temperature was back to normal and she 
			was able to eat lunch.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We did not have a lot else to do so spent 
			most of the rest of the afternoon in the room reading. In the 
			evening we walked to the bus station where we bought tickets for 
			tomorrow's 9:00 bus to Tulum and took out enough money to pay for 
			the hotel when we get there. Although feeling better, Roz was still 
			not up to eating Mexican food so we ate at the McDonalds opposite 
			the bus station and then spent an hour or so wandering round the 
			souvenir shops on 5th Avenue. Loads of stuff that we want to buy but 
			no way of carrying any more than we already have. We were back in 
			the room by 9ish.</p>

<p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 20th January </span>We checked out of the hotel at 8:45 and walked 
			to the bus station. It was a one hour journey to the centre of 
			Tulum. We got a taxi from outside the bus station to Piedra 
			Escondida, the hotel at the beach where we will spend the next four 
			nights. We were at the hotel by 10:30 and met Regan and Annette on 
			the beach - they got here two days ago and are staying in the room 
			next to us. After getting into our room, we spent most of the rest 
			of the day lying on the beach. It was reasonably warm on the beach 
			but still quite cold as soon as you got out of the sun.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			At 4:00, I went for a 5.2 mile run, the furthest I have run since 
			May. We started on the session at about 5:30. We had drinks on next 
			door's balcony before heading just up the road to a bar/restaurant. 
			Had an excellent meal and a few margaritas. I do not remember too much about the rest of 
			the evening!</p>
