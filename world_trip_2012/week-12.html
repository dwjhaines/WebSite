<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 13th August </span>Our Cebu Pacific flight left Singapore twenty minutes 
			early at almost exactly midnight. It was a budget airline and was 
			cramped with uncomfortable seats and limited legroom. We did however 
			manage to get about an hours sleep during the 3.5 hour flight. We 
			got through immigration in Cebu without any problems and collected 
			our luggage by 4am. We had arranged a transfer through Thresher 
			Shark Divers (TSD) and there was someone waiting outside the airport 
			for us. We had a three hour car journey to Maya and then a 30 minute 
			boat ride out to Malapascua. The sea was too rough for the boat to 
			moor on Bounty Beach so we were dropped on the opposite side of the 
			island and completed our journey with the two of us on the back of a 
			moped. We were eventually dropped at the TSD dive centre just after 
			8am.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We left all our gear at the dive centre and walked to the resort (Tepanee) 
			that we had booked. Our room was not going to be available until 
			midday but they let us have a fan room so we could shower and get a 
			few hours sleep while we waited. We returned to the dive centre to 
			fill in the forms etc at 11:30 and had lunch in Oscar's 
			Pub/Restaurant upstairs.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XjELdtGorJU/UCzIQ9OhGlI/AAAAAAAAFYc/4HVjgYkr3zw/s320/IMG_1806.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
By the time we were back at Tepanee our room was ready. The room was 
			very nice but certainly, the balcony did not have the sea view that 
			we were promised. Roz went back to the dive centre to complain and 
			also looked at other options but there are no sea view rooms 
			available where we are and the TSD did not know if they were able to 
			do anything about it (despite the fact that it was them who booked 
			the room).
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went out for a pizza in the evening. Malapascua is a lot smaller 
			than Tioman but has lots more eating options. It was nice to have 
			the option of a few places to eat again and the restaurant right 
			next to our hotel does superb Italian food. After eating, we went 
			back to Oscar's for a beer and were told that if we wanted to, we 
			could find another room somewhere else and TSD would give us the 
			money back for the room we had booked. However, by the time we 
			returned to Blue Corals, the room that Roz had seen earlier was no 
			longer available so it looks as if we are staying where we are for 
			the next week!</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1bNyRmd32hs/UCtm1Kv733I/AAAAAAAAFYE/oqIbp_1g4dc/s320/IMG_1751.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 14th August </span>The number one attraction of Malapascua is the thresher 
			sharks that can be viewed on early morning dives. We were at the 
			dive centre by 4:40 for our first trip out to Monad Shoal the 
			location of the cleaning stations where they can be viewed. We 
			boarded the boat with about 20 other divers and staff for the 20 
			minute journey out to the dive site and we were in the water just 
			before 6:00. At the dive site, you usually have to go down to about 
			30m and wait for them to turn up. We had hoped to see maybe one or 
			two of the sharks but saw the first at about 15m after less than 
			three minutes. We saw another three more at 18m and then descended 
			to the cleaning station where there were two more. A very good start 
			to our diving here!
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back at Oscar's for breakfast and headed off for the second 
			dive at about 9:30 (after showing a member of TSD staff round our 
			resort to show that not all rooms have sea view!). The next dive was 
			at Deep Rock a deep macro site. There was loads to see here 
			including frog fish and lots of crabs and shrimps that we have not 
			seen before. I also found a flamboyant cuttle fish - only the second 
			one of these that we have ever seen. Third dive was at a site close 
			to the previous one. Another muck dive but not quite as much to see. 
			As with Mabul, we have been unlucky with the weather here. There is 
			a tropical storm hitting the Philippines at the moment and we are 
			just about close enough to it to feel its effect. This means that a 
			lot of the island can not be dived due to the rough sea and there 
			are only a few sites that we can dive. It also means a 10 - 15 
			minute walk around the island to get to and from the boat every time 
			we dive.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we were back from the third dive, it was 5ish. We had a 
			few drinks on our balcony while planning what to do in the two weeks 
			we have when we leave Malapascua and then went out for a pizza 
			again. A couple more drinks when we got back and we were in bed by 
			about 11.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th August </span>A slightly later start this morning! We were in Oscar's 
			for breakfast by 8 and downstairs at the dive centre in time for the 
			9:30 dive. We had to walk across the island again as it is still 
			very windy. This also meant that we are still limited on dive sites. 
			We dived at Bantigue and Deep Rock again. Bantigue is in the same 
			corner of the island as the other sites we dived yesterday and was a 
			similar type of dive. The dive at Deep Rock was excellent again. We 
			failed to find the flamboyant cuttle fish but Roz found a similar 
			sized cuttle fish and once again, there was loads to see. </p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back slightly earlier today but did not do too much for the 
			rest of the afternoon/evening. We were both worn out after the last 
			few days and are diving early again tomorrow. We went out to La Isla 
			Bonita, a restaurant recommended to us by someone at TSD and had 
			really good curries. Were back in the room by 8:30.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LdvFtseJYVg/UC5IwYniy4I/AAAAAAAAFYs/HDSCa1KrqcU/s320/IMG_1881.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th August </span>Second trip to see the thresher sharks at Monad Shoal 
			so another early start. We went to a slightly different part of the 
			site - (old) instead of (new) - and the dive was not as good. It was 
			more like how we were expecting it to be here i.e. about 40 minutes 
			of waiting around looking for the sharks and then seeing one for 
			less than a minute as it swam past. At least our group did see one - 
			we were the only group on the boat that did.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Two more local dives during the day. The first at Quiliano was OK 
			and the third at Deep Rock was very good again. The good news was 
			that by the end of the third dive, the wind had dropped and the sea 
			was calm meaning that we could be dropped by boat right outside the 
			dive shop. It also means that we will be able to get to some of the 
			further dive sites tomorrow.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			In between the second and third dives, we booked a room for two 
			nights at another resort for next Monday and Tuesday. We had planned 
			to leave Malapascua after seven nights but will stay another two. We 
			both like it here and it gives us more time to complete the 15 dive 
			package that we have paid for without having to do dives that we may 
			not want to.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went for a couple of beers at Oscars before eating at La Isla 
			Bonita again. We returned to the room for a few more drinks on the 
			balcony and seemed to get quite drunk without drinking that much. 
			Got to bed sometime around 11.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uPmJXe_KwK4/UC9eK-8mMeI/AAAAAAAAFY8/k8V2PGWAhqk/s320/IMG_1982.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 17th August </span>We were able to board the dive boat in front of the 
			shop for today's day trip, an improvement on having to walk half way 
			round the island. The day trip was a two-tank trip with one dive at 
			the Dona Marilyn wreck, about 90 minutes North of Malapascua and the 
			second at Gato Island on the way back. Both dives were very good. 
			The 98m wreck was in good condition with plenty of coral on it and 
			Gato Island was another very nice site. Again, lots of coral, a 
			couple of large white tip sharks and a sea-horse.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back at the dive centre by 4ish and went out again at 5:30 
			to do the "Mandarin Dive" which turned out to be the best dive of 
			the day. We have done these before. Mandarin fish hide in the coral 
			and mate at dusk by floating up in the water for a few seconds. The 
			previous times we have been to see them, there have been very few of 
			them and they have been hard to see. Tonight there were loads of 
			them and we saw several mating pairs. After watching them for about 
			30 minutes, we did the second half of the dive (by now in darkness) 
			in an area famous for sea-horses. We saw seven of them. far more 
			than we have ever seen on a single dive before.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Once again, we were worn out after the the three dives so after 
			eating at La Isla Bonita again, we had an early night.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 18th August </span>Another day trip - this time with both dives at Gato 
			Island. We dived on our own with Danx as Balt, our guide from the 
			last few days has had to take time off. Two good dives again. The 
			first was very similar to the dive we did here yesterday but without 
			the strong currents. For the second dive, we went through the 45m 
			tunnel that goes all the way under the island. It starts at about 3m 
			on one side of the island and emerges on the other side at about 9m. 
			On both dives we saw large white tip reef sharks, frog fish and 
			loads of nudis. We were back at the dive centre by 2:30 - the good 
			weather and the fact that the boats can go right up to the dive 
			centre has made the diving here a lot more enjoyable for the last 
			couple of days! It means that the whole day is not taken up by two 
			hours of diving.</p>

<p  class="diary-text">
Did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We went to Oscar's 
			for a couple of beers in the evening and had a few more with our 
			pizza at Angelina's. We returned to the balcony by 9:45 so we could 
			follow the first day of the football season on the laptop while 
			drinking our remaining Bacardi (QPR 0, Swansea 5!!!).
</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 19th August </span>We had not arranged any diving for today and spent most 
			of the day recovering from last night. We went for breakfast at 11 
			but spent most of the rest of the day in the room. We did do the 
			sunset dive at Lighthouse again. Another very good dive with plenty 
			more mandarin fish and sea-horses. After showering, we returned to 
			the dive centre and had tea at Oscar's. Back in the room before 9pm.</p>
