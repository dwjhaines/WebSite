                            </span>Did not get out of bed until about 10:30 after too many nights of not
                            enough sleep in the last week. We had breakfast in the apartment during which
                            things started going wrong with the electric. The trip switch started tripping
                            every few minutes and sometimes could not be reset. Someone came round with
                            heaters and blankets for us but after a lot of trying, he could not sort out the
                            problem. Apparently the only electrician that can come is somewhere else today
                            so no-one could fix the fault. It got left so that half the apartment does have
                            electric but there is no light in the lounge, no hot water in the kitchen, no
                            heater in the bathroom and the air-conditioning units, which may or may not be
                            able to give us hot air, did not work at all.</p>

                        <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                            src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NoBMzI3Y_Ck/UVRTji9sGsI/AAAAAAAAKpM/qhlkR3IKdRg/s320/IMG_8431.JPG"></div>

                            We had a few hours of not doing much. As well as the cold, it was raining
                            heavily and walking into Kotor did not appeal much. At about 2:30, we tried
                            without success to call a taxi to come and get us. By 3:00 the rain had eased
                            off a bit and we could make the 25 - 30 minute walk into town. We went into the
                            old town and stopped for a drink in the first bar we came to.
                        </p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            By the time we came out of there, the sun had come out for the first time today
                            so we could spend a bit of time walking around, seeing the sights and taking
                            photos. We went to another bar before finding a restaurant to eat in. Once we
                            had eaten, we returned to our first bar for a couple more drinks. It was a
                            really nice bar - definitely the best we have found in Kotor -&nbsp; and we
                            would of stayed longer had the music not been too loud. We are all getting old!</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            We left the bar at 10:00ish by which time it was raining heavily again. We got a
                            taxi back to the apartment where we drank a litre bottle of wine before going to
                            bed.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            While in the last bar, we found out that John Hill had died in hospital. We knew
                            that he had fallen and broken his leg last week and although he had seemed to be
                            recovering, he died at 4pm this afternoon.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th March
                            </span>We had another late breakfast and set off for Podgorica just after 11:00.
                            We stopped in a couple of places on the way. First stop was Budvar. The
                            Montenegro Lonely Planet described the Budvar old town as a mini Dubrovnik. This
                            was a bit of an exaggeration as although it was nice in places, a lot of it was
                            run down and in need of cleaning up a bit. There was certainly nothing anywhere
                            near as spectacular as the Dubrovnik equivalent and I did not think it compared
                            to Kotor's old town.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            We drove from there 5km South to get views of Sveti Stefan, a small island
                            linked by a causeway to the mainland that is pictured on the cover of our guide
                            book. We did get very good views of it as we drove around but it did look a lot
                            more appealing on the book, with clear skies and bright blue sea. In the grey
                            cloud and murky green water, the hotel on the island looked as if it could be a
                            prison. We stopped for lunch at a restaurant on the main road overlooking the
                            island before continuing the rest of the way to Podgorica.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            We arrived in Podgorica just after 4:00 and easily found the hotel where we had
                            to collect our tickets. Unfortunately, the car park that we used on our previous
                            trip here was now a building site and we spent the best part of an hour driving
                            around trying to find somewhere else to park. Most places either had metered
                            parking (max 3 hour stay) or where not the sort of places we wanted to leave the
                            car. We eventually found a space and after conversations with a few locals,
                            agreed that we could leave the car there and did not have to pay anything.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            We had a few drinks before the game although it was only a few. It was Mark's
                            turn to drive and there is a zero tolerance to drink driving over here i.e. you
                            can not have any alcohol at all. We got takeaways on the way to the ground and
                            were inside by about 8:30.
                        </p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            The game was pretty good overall but disappointing about the way we threw the
                            game away by being crap in the second half. Overall, about what we were
                            expecting really after hearing the team.</p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            As with our last visit here, we were kept in the ground for about 40 minutes for
                            no apparent reason after the game. When we were eventually let out, we had a 10
                            minute walk back to the car and a just under two hour drive back to Kotor. We
                            were back in the apartment by about 1:30.</p>

                            </span>Weather was much better today so once we had all had breakfast, we headed
                            off to walk to the castle above the old town. Roz and I had been up here before
                            but Mark and Steve hadn't and we were keen to go up again anyway. We parked the
                            car just outside the old town, walked through to the starting point and started
                            climbing at about 11:30. It took about 45 minutes to get the top and we then
                            spent half an hour or so taking photos, etc. We walked down again headed back to
                            the apartment stopping at a supermarket for more food and drink on the way back.
                        </p>

                        <p class="diary-text">
                            We had a late lunch and a few drinks in the apartment before walking back into
                            the old town. We had a few more drinks in a bar and then a couple of litres of
                            wine with our meal in a restaurant before getting a taxi home.</p>

                            and walked down to where we had left the car yesterday (the road had been closed
                            and we had left the car at the bottom of the hill). It took us just under two
                            hours to drive back to Dubrovnik airport. We returned the hire car without any
                            additional problems and checked in for the 15:45 BA flight back to Gatwick. The
                            flight left about 75 minutes late and we arrived in Gatwick at about 7pm. |We
                            said goodbye to Mark and the three of us got the bus back to the car-park. We
                            drove back to Kingsclere, dropping Steve in Woking on the way and got back to
                            the house just after 9:00</p>
