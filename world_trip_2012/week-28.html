                Another quiet day without a lot to do. Spent a few hours by the pool, had lunch
                at Kaw Kwang and walked into Saladan in the evening.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">

                was our "visa run" . We were picked up from Kaw Kwang at 7:40. The mini-bus only
                had three other people in it which was good news. We picked up one more in
                Saladan but were on our way to the first ferry by 8. The journey to the border
                was not too bad. We collected another six people at Trang, filling the minibus
                but they were only with us for a couple of hours - we had a half hour detour to
                drop them off at the ferry pier for Ko Lipe.</p>

                Today was our "visa run". We were picked up from Kaw Kwang at 7:40. The mini-bus only had three other people in it which was good news. We picked up one more in Saladan but were on our way to the first ferry by 8. The journey to the border was not too bad. We collected another six people at Trang, filling the minibus but they were only with us for a couple of hours - we had a half hour detour to drop them off at the ferry pier for Ko Lipe.</p>
               
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the border at 12:45. It was a much smaller border than the one we
                crossed a couple of weeks ago. There was hardly anyone going through it apart
                from people on visa runs! The whole process went very smoothly. We got stamped
                out of Thailand and then walked about 25m to Malaysian immigration. We got
                stamped into Malaysia, walked to the next counter and got stamped back out
                again. We were in the country for about two minutes. We then walked back to
                Thailand and got another 15 day entry stamp. It all took about 10 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a lunch break before heading back and were on our way again by 1:30. The
                journey back was also pretty good. We were back to the first ferry by 5:00. The
                ferries took a bit longer than usual as it was peak time but we were still back
                in Kaw Kwang by 6:05. Not the ideal way of spending a day but probably better
                than we had expected. The mini-bus was only half full, the border was quite
                interesting and we got back in just over 10 hours. It could of been a lot worse!<br>
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the room, we had a couple of drinks and went out to eat at Hans but it
                was a relatively early night.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th December
                </span>We could not be bothered to do anything today, our last full day on
                Lanta. We spent most of the day by the pool or making use of the Wi-Fi in the
                restaurant. I went for my last run along the beach in the evening but it was
                generally a very lazy day.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to Hans restaurant to eat again and had a few drinks without getting too
                drunk. We had spent a lot of time discussing whether or not we should come back
                to Lanta in April but someone we talked to tonight said that the weather is bad
                by then and a lot of places will have closed for the low season. We may now
                change those plans again.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th December
                </span>We had a final hour by the pool and checked out of Kaw Kwang just before
                mid-day. Despite what we still have ahead of us, we were both quite sad to be
                leaving Kaw Kwang. If we had not already booked the room in Phi Phi, it would of
                been very easy to stay longer.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by a songthaew at 12:00 and driven to the ferry pier for the
                1pm boat to Phi Phi. We were told there (after being given our stickers) that
                one of the boats had broken down and we would have to wait for another. This
                seemed likely to be a big delay but another boat turned up by about 12:45 and it
                was only five minutes late departing. The boat was not full so was reasonably
                comfortable - they can be packed in the high season. The journey was only just
                over an hour.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the boat and walked directly to Phi Phi Scuba who we will be diving with
                during the next 10 days and have dived with a few times before. We agreed with
                them that we could dive on our own and do 70 minute dives which was exactly what
                we wanted. Most of their guides are DMT's and we decided after we were here in
                January that we would be better off on our own! We left all our dive equipment
                with them and walked the rest of the way to Phi Phi View Point Resort.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sM7Te3hxrsQ/UMHiERH6TKI/AAAAAAAAIp8/0-0Qpuwtmb4/s320/IMG_6440.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have stayed here twice before. We are getting a bit old for Phi Phi (and
                would probably not of enjoyed the centre much when we were the right age for it)
                but this resort has rooms high up on a hill away from the main centre of the
                island.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The balcony has excellent views and gets the sun all
                afternoon, so is a relatively peaceful place to spend our afternoons after
                diving. We were in the same room that we had stayed in last January. It does not
                have air-con but being on the hill means that it stays cool for most of the day.
                After carrying all our stuff up to the room, I walked down to buy sandwiches and
                we stayed on the balcony for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we returned to Phi Phi Scuba to pay a deposit and sort out what
                is happening tomorrow. We ate at Cosmic Pizza before returning to the room for
                an early night.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th December
                </span>Up at 6:30 and at the dive centre by 7:15. One of the reasons we like Phi
                Phi Scuba is that they dive early meaning you are back on Phi Phi by lunchtime.
                The dive boat was quite busy but the sites are not far away so this is not too
                much of a problem. The dives were at Ko Bida Nok and Malong to Palong with an
                hour or so in Maya Bay in between. Both dives were very good. The vis was not
                great but there were loads of fish around both sites. We saw plenty of turtles -
                one on the first dive and four on the second (Roz saw five).
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back on Phi Phi by 2:00. After washing our gear, we walked back to Phi
                Phi View Point buying sandwiches for lunch on the way. Spent the rest of the
                afternoon on the balcony or in the room. We walked back into the centre in the
                evening after a couple of drinks on the balcony. We sorted out our gear at the
                dive centre ready for tomorrow and ate at "Tom Yam" a Thai restaurant that we
                have eaten at before. A slightly later night than yesterday but we were still
                asleep by about 10:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 7th December
                </span>Up at 6:30 and at the dive centre by 7:15 again. We had booked to go on a
                three dive trip today to the sites nearer to Phuket. The dives were at the King
                Cruiser wreck, Anemone Reef and Shark Point. There was a reasonably strong
                current on the wreck meaning that we did not see much of the wreck itself - it
                was easier to stay in the area around the buoy line. As this is the area with
                the most fish anyway this did not work out too bad. A lot of the wreck has now
                collapsed making it quite a deep dive and this area is also the shallowest so we
                could stay down for 54 minutes without nitrox.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cpvkSaonWR8/UMRh7c8BJMI/AAAAAAAAIqY/aJwmF8DxqRQ/s320/IMG_6581.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Both the other two dives were very good as well. Loads of schools of fish on
                both sites as well as plenty of soft coral. We managed to find the sea-horse at
                Anemone Reef but not the ones at Shark Point. We had been on a smaller boat
                today with a lot less divers so the whole day was very enjoyable.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We did not get back to Phi Phi until 5ish so were not back at the room until
                gone 5:30. We had a few drinks on the balcony before going out to eat. We ate at
                Tom Yam again and then went to The Sports Bar for the football. This is not a
                place we would choose to drink in but it had four televisions showing different
                games so we could sit and watch both Sunderland and Swansea losing at the same
                time. We were back at the room sometime after midnight.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 8th December
                </span>Spent just about the whole day in the room or on the balcony. We have
                free Wi-Fi in the room so were able to spend the day catching up on e-mail,
                editing photos, etc. I went out to buy sandwiches for lunch and we ate at Cosmic
                Pizza again in the evening but did not go anywhere else.</p>
