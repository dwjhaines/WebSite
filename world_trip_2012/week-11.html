<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 6th August</span> Did not do a lot all day. We got up and had breakfast 
			at 10ish. I walked into Tekek again at midday, a round trip of about 
			five miles, this time to buy more bottles 
			of Bacardi from the duty free shop at the airport. By the time I had 
			carried four litres back to Bamboo Hill,&nbsp; I was totally worn out so slept for a couple of hours. We 
			went out at about 4:30 and handed in our forms at the dive centre as 
			we will do our first dives here tomorrow. We met Regan and Annette 
			for tea at 7 and were back in our room by 8:30.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th August</span> We had booked to do two boat dives with B &amp; J Dive 
			Centre. The diving around Tioman is not great compared to where we 
			have just been or where we will be going to but it is OK and we will 
			do a few dives while we are here. We were at the dive centre by 8:30 
			and all walked back to the jetty to board the boat. It was a bigger 
			boat than the ones we have been diving from recently and had about 
			18 customers and five staff on it. We dived with a Finnish guide - 
			Jukka - in a group of four.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qjD9zWNSLt8/UCe7r0xZ4zI/AAAAAAAAFUA/LgXyBbLSfj0/s320/IMG_4588.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
The two dives were nice enough without being too spectacular. We saw 
			a turtle on the first dive and the sites had plenty of fish and 
			coral. The vis was not great but there was enough to see to make the 
			dives worth doing. We were back at the dive centre by 3:00.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Roz and 
			I then dived the house reef in front of the dive shop on our own. 
			Doing this dive unguided and with our own equipment only cost RM40 
			(£8). We failed to find the resident turtle but again, there was 
			plenty of fish and it was all quite enjoyable.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We 
			all got drunk again in the evening. It was a similar session to the 
			one on Saturday - a few drinks on the balcony, a few more with tea, 
			a few beers at B &amp; J's bar and a few more Bacardi's before walking 
			home sometime around midnight.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 8th August </span>Another day of not doing a lot. Went out for breakfast 
			and spent some time on the beach but spent most of the day reading 
			or sleeping in the room.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Had problems finding anywhere to eat in the evening. Ramadan is 
			still taking place and a lot of places do not open until an hour or 
			so after sunset. Tonight, just about everywhere on the beach was 
			closed until 8ish when we ended up in same place as last night</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-phNbWQUFflQ/UCe7q162EAI/AAAAAAAAFUI/rOfoYPaWhTc/s320/IMG_1631.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 9th August </span>Three dives again today. Like on Tuesday, we did two 
			boat dives and the ABC House Reef. We dived from a smaller boat 
			today which was better as it had fewer people on it. We were led by 
			Christian and had a Malaysian couple with us making a group of six. 
			The first dive did not start well as the Malaysian girl had problems 
			with her ears and they aborted the dive after about 5 minutes. The 
			rest of the dive was better (for us anyway). Quite a nice site with 
			plenty of coral.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Everyone managed to get down for the second dive. Once again, a nice 
			enough site. We saw two hawksbill turtles, one of which we stayed 
			with for at least 10 minutes. As usual with hawksbills, it was not 
			the slightest bit bothered by divers and carried on eating the whole 
			time we were with it.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			For the third dive of the day, we repeated the dive we did on 
			Tuesday afternoon but this time with Regan and Annette. It was a 
			similar dive but this time we managed to find the cuttle fish as 
			well as "Gilbert" the resident hawksbill turtle.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			Once again, we were limited in where we could eat and ended up in 
			the same place we have been three times already since we have been 
			here. The lack of choice for eating is one of the only drawbacks to 
			Tioman we have found so far but it probably would put us off coming back 
			again. We were back in the room just after 9.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 10th August </span>Another three dives. The boat trip today was out to 
			Labas Island. The first site, at the island itself was excellent. 
			The vis was still not great but the coral was excellent and there 
			was plenty to see. The second site was supposed to be Tiger Reef but 
			it got changed to Golden Reef due to strong surface currents. As it 
			was, we were the only group that managed to get in the water at 
			Golden Reef as they had another change of plan when everyone saw the 
			problems we had getting in. Once down to about 10m, the currents 
			stopped and it was another very nice site although the dive time got 
			shortened due to the amount of air used getting down. Saw loads of 
			nudis on both dives.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8tCrf4CfhZ0/UCe7pQq65tI/AAAAAAAAFTw/3ooQ3igL7eE/s320/IMG_1713.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
For 
			the third it was just Roz and me again, the others being too tired! 
			This time, we found the turtle right at the end of the dive so spent 
			10 - 15 minutes watching him eat before we got out. A perfect way to 
			finish our diving here. We washed out all our equipment and left 
			half of it at the dive centre to dry and carried the rest back to 
			the room.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we were back at the room, it was already getting on for 
			6pm. We had time for showers and log books before going and joining 
			Regan and Annette for another evening on the Bacardi. As usual, we 
			had a few on their balcony before eating at the normal restaurant. 
			We had one beer in the bar before returning to the balcony to 
			continue drinking. Got back to our room about 2ish having somehow managing to hurt my 
			knee on the way back.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th August </span>Did not do a lot all day again. We went for breakfast 
			at 10ish and went out again to pay our bill at the dive centre at 
			lunchtime. We also bought new booties (ours are falling apart and a 
			lot heavier than the new ones we bought) and collected the rest of 
			our gear. Apart from that, we did not leave the room until the 
			evening. Lying in the room or sitting on the balcony is just as nice 
			as sitting on the beach so there was no reason to move.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			It was our last evening in Tioman. We finished the remaining Bacardi 
			on Regan's balcony, ate in our usual restaurant (squid sambal for 
			the seventh night in a row) and had a beer in the B&amp;J bar but it was 
			a relatively quiet and early night compared to yesterday.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th August </span>We were up just after 7 to begin what is likely to be a 
			26 hour journey to Malapascua in The Philippines. We left Bamboo 
			Hill at 7:30 and walked to the jetty, stopping for breakfast on the 
			way. The ferry back to Mersing was due at 9:00 but we got to the 
			jetty by 8:00. It is peak season and the Sunday return ferries often 
			fill up as well as being subject to last minute schedule changes. It 
			was essential that we got on the ferry so we were not taking any 
			chances. In the end, the ferry did turn up at almost exactly 9:00 
			and was not that full leaving ABC beach but it filled up completely 
			by the time it left Tekek.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back in Mersing just before midday and walked to the Indian 
			restaurant we had eaten in a couple of times a week ago, for lunch. We 
			walked from there to the bus station. We had tickets for the 3pm bus 
			and had about two hours to wait until we left. The bus journey from 
			there to Johor Bahru was only a bit longer than two hours. Johor 
			Bahru is right on the border with Singapore but it took another two 
			hours to get across the border. First we had to transfer to another 
			bus to take us to the border. We were dropped at Malaysian 
			immigration and had to walk through to get stamped out of the 
			country. We then boarded another bus which took us across the 
			causeway to Singapore immigration. Once again everyone had to get 
			off the bus to get stamped into Singapore before boarding the final 
			bus to take us into the centre of Singapore. Each step of this 
			process was fairly chaotic with long queues and no organisation. 
			Having to carry all our diving equipment did not make it any easier.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We finally made it into the centre of Singapore just after 7 and 
			walked to the MRT station to get the train out to Changi Airport. By 
			the time we reached the airport we had come to the conclusion that 
			we were getting too old for this type of travelling! It had been a 
			tough day and we were still 12 hours from our destination. At the airport, 
			we went to the Air Asia and British Airways customer service desks 
			to try and resolve issues we have with flights later in our trip. 
			Neither visit gave us a lot of hope that the issues would be 
			resolved.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We got the bus out to the Budget Terminal, ate at the McDonalds and 
			checked in for the 00:20 flight to Cebu. We had expected to have a 
			long time to kill at the airport, but in the end only had a 
			couple of hours. By the time we had checked e-mail for the first 
			time in a couple of days and gone through to departures, it was 
			already gone 11:00.</p>
