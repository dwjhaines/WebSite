                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 21st January
                </span>Did not do a lot all morning. Roz and I got a taxi into Tulum in the
                afternoon. We went to the bus station to check bus times for Thursday and found
                a bank to take out the US dollars to pay for our hotel (they charge 5% if you
                pay in pesos for some reason).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After stopping for lunch, we walked out to the ruins that
                the town is famous for. The ruins are not the most impressive ones we will see
                in Mexico but the location of them, on a cliff overlooking the sea made them
                quite spectacular. We spent about an hour walking around the ruins and another
                hour walking back to the hotel.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate out at the same restaurant as yesterday but had a more sober evening as
                we are all diving tomorrow. We were back at the hotel by 8:30.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 22nd January
                </span>Two dives today with Maya Divers, a dive operator based in a resort about
                10km from where we are staying. Regan had booked it all and arranged for us to
                be picked up at 8:30. By 8:50, no-one had turned up. The receptionist from our
                hotel called the dive centre who had no knowledge of having to pick us up. They
                sent a taxi to get us and we eventually arrived at the dive centre at about
                9:30. More good news once we got to the dive centre. A large group diving the
                cenotes had taken too many weights with them meaning there was not enough for
                us. We had to wait around while they went to borrow some from another operator.
                There were not enough weight belts around when they did get the weights so most
                of us had to dive with weights in our BCD pockets. It's fair to say that at this
                point we were very unimpressed with Maya Divers!!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Things did get better after this. We were taken out by boat to the first site.
                We dived in a group of seven, the four of us plus three others and were led by
                Jamie. He did a pretty good job considering that the group had very different
                levels of experience. He took the beginner up when he was low on air, let
                another pair go up on their own and made sure we had two decent length dives (68
                and 90 minutes). The dive sites were nothing too spectacular compared to other
                areas of Mexico but they were both enjoyable enough dives.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by 4ish and then had a similar session to the one on
                Sunday night.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 23rd January
                </span>It was cold and raining when we woke up. We did not do much all morning.
                At 1:45, Swansea played Chelsea in the League Cup semi-final second leg. I had
                hoped to watch this in a bar over the road from us but it was closed when I went
                to have a look at about 1:30. Instead, we bought a few beers from the
                supermarket and watched the game on the laptop in the bedroom. We managed to
                find a very good site showing the game although we did have to have the
                commentary in Danish. The result means an unplanned trip back to London for a
                couple of days at the end of February!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We carried on drinking on our balcony after the game - it was still cold and wet
                so there was not a lot else to do - and were eventually joined by Regan and
                Annette. We all went back to our usual restaurant at 7ish. Had a very good meal
                again and the usual selection of cocktails. We returned to the balcony for a few
                more drinks before getting to bed sometime around 11.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 24th January
                </span>Did not do a lot all morning again. The weather was better today so it
                was possible to lie on the beach. At midday, Roz and I said our goodbyes to
                Regan and Annette and checked out of the hotel. Regan and Annette are staying
                another couple of nights.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi into the ADO bus station in the centre of Tulum and bought tickets
                for the 13:20 bus back to Playa Del Carmen. We had lunch while we waited in the
                bus station and were back in Playa just after 2pm. We walked from the bus
                station to the ferry terminal and bought tickets for the 15:00 ferry to Cozumel.
                We arrived in Cozumel shortly before 4pm.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                From the ferry terminal, we walked a few blocks South to the Aldora Dive Centre
                who we have booked both our accommodation and diving with. They seemed a bit
                more organised than the last operator we were with! We filled in the paperwork
                and left all our dive gear in mesh bags that they provided. We had arrived a day
                earlier than expected but they managed to book us on to a dive trip for
                tomorrow. We were collected from the dive centre by Brent and driven to the
                Aldora Villas where we will stay for the next 7 or 8 nights.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked to a nearby supermarket to buy things for tomorrow's breakfast and
                lunch before returning to the room for showers. We walked into the centre of
                town, about a mile South of where we are staying, in the evening to eat (more
                tacos). After two successive nights of drinking, we were both worn out again so
                it was straight back to the hotel after eating and a relatively early night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 25th January
                </span>Today was our first days diving with Aldora. After breakfast, we were
                driven by Brent to a pier in town and were on the boat by about 9. We were
                diving with Edgar (guide) and one other diver. It took about 30 - 40 minutes to
                get to the first dive site Columbia Deep) and we were in the water by 10:18.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0_ErftmLkz4/UQW2Zh2oNoI/AAAAAAAAJKY/HOsXSav_QXg/s320/IMG_7014.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The dive was excellent, a huge improvement on the other dives we have done so
                far in Mexico. The visibility was superb, the scenery spectacular with lots of
                swim-throughs and there was loads to see. There were five or six turtles, eagle
                rays and a nurse shark. We had just over an hour surface interval, spent mainly
                on the beach before the second dive at Santa Rosa Wall. This was not quite as
                good as the first but was still a very good dive with another turtle, another
                eagle ray and another nurse shark.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Aldora had advertised that they give long dive times. We were given bigger tanks
                with 240 bar of air in so were able to stay down for 68 and 80 minutes. The only
                thing limiting our dives was our NDL's so we will probably use nitrox from now
                on.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the villas by 4 and after lunch went out to dive the house reef.
                Diving here is free while we are staying here. The dive was not wonderful and we
                certainly would not bother doing it again if we had to pay. There was a few
                things to see however and it was just about worth doing.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were both worn out again after the third dive. Roz had got up at 3am this
                morning to watch the tennis and was just about asleep as soon as we had washed
                our gear and had showers. I did walk into town briefly in the evening but it was
                another early night.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rVBj4pXwSFM/UQcDS_y3zcI/AAAAAAAAJK4/kQZBR-fueas/s320/IMG_7071.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th January
                </span>Two more dives today (using Nitrox this time). The dive boat picked us up
                from the Villas just before 8. We were in a group led by Liangosta and were with
                four other divers. Both dives were very good again. At the start of the first,
                we watched 8 nurse sharks circling for about 10 minutes. We also had another
                eagle ray swimming past and more turtles. The scenery was quite similar to the
                first dive yesterday with plenty of spectacular pinnacles and swim-throughs.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive was a long drift dive at 15 - 19m along the top of a wall. We
                still saw turtles, an eagle ray and a sleeping nurse shark as well as a lot more
                fish than on any other dive since we have been here. Also saw our first Cozumel
                Catfish of this trip. We were back at the villas earlier today.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, Roz spent an hour or so in the sun while I borrowed one of the free
                bikes and cycled out to the supermarket near where we stayed the last time we
                were in Cozumel. In the evening we had a couple of drinks before walking into
                town and eating at a restaurant recommended by Brent.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_NsFli7SzIM/UQcDQI8Tw3I/AAAAAAAAJKw/I2hRKAULXJg/s320/IMG_0088.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 26th January
                </span>A day off diving today. Roz was up at 3 again to watch the tennis. I was
                awake for some of it but managed to sleep through most of it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a slightly later breakfast than usual and then
                spent an hour or so making bookings for our trip back to London for the League
                Cup Final. We managed to get our flights all booked. It will mean leaving Mexico
                five days earlier than planned and flying to Fort Lauderdale. From there, we
                have return flights to London. We will continue our trip as planned once we fly
                back to America.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Once this was all sorted out, we had an hour or two in the sun. The weather
                finally seems to be improving and it is getting hotter again. We both cycled out
                to Mega supermarket to buy stuff for lunch which we ate outside our room again.
                Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Had a similar evening to yesterday and
                walked in to eat at the same restaurant.</p>
