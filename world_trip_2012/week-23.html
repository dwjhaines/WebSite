                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 29th October
                </span>Back to our normal routine here of two dives at the wreck with the
                another one elsewhere in between. The first early morning dive at the Liberty
                featured plenty of bump-heads as usual. We did the second at Drop-off which was
                very good again - we found two ghost pipe fish on the way to the wall.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                During the evening dive at the wreck, we managed to find a pygmy sea-horse. We
                had spotted a guide pointing it out to someone on the morning dive and were able
                to go back to the same piece of coral to find it.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Did not do much all day apart from the dives. We ate out at the Safety Stop and
                had another early night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th October
                </span>Four dives, and over five hours underwater, today. The first and last
                were our usual early morning and late afternoon dives at the wreck. Both of
                these were very good again - plenty of bump-heads in the morning and an
                enjoyable 50 minutes of muck-diving before hitting the wreck in the afternoon.</p>

            <p class="diary-text"></p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tey8nj4gLzI/UJSikLYokgI/AAAAAAAAHps/Lk0pBLyxSDo/s320/IMG_5149.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In between we had a trip to Kubu. We were driven to Kubu, about three miles away
                just before 10am. We were dropped there with four tanks meaning we could do two
                dives before being picked up again at 2:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The reef is split into two there and we did one dive on each of the two sides.
                We had dived here a few weeks ago with a guide but this was the first time we
                had done them unguided. The sites were not too difficult and both dives were
                enjoyable without being too spectacular. We did manage to find the frog-fish
                that we saw when we were here last time (with a bit of help from someone else's
                guide). There was a reasonable amount of coral and plenty of fish on both sites.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had completed the fourth dive, we were both totally worn out. It
                was Safety Stop again to eat and back in the room by about 8:30.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-msDGRVExNY8/UJZR47pT4HI/AAAAAAAAH6E/1dk-91u6Utc/s320/SEAsia_708.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 31st October
                </span>Just the three dives again today. Our early morning dive at the wreck was
                excellent as usual. We found another wunderpus as we were leaving the wreck
                which extended the dive to 90 minutes - our longest dive here yet.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to change rooms again after the first dive. When we booked a couple of
                weeks ago, we were only able to get the room behind the dive centre for four
                nights. The next two nights are in one of the rooms behind the TWD restaurant.
                These are not quite as good although the balconies have excellent views of Mt
                Agung. Just being a bit away from the dive centre is not quite as convenient,
                and there is no Wi-Fi in the rooms. We will probably cope for a couple of days.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Second dive was at Coral Garden again. Also a very good dive including a few
                minutes with the resident black-tip reef shark. For the third dive, we again
                spent about 45 minutes on the black sand before getting to the wreck. Again
                there was loads to see. A lot we had seen already and knew where to find but we
                did see a harlequin shrimp that we had not seen here before and were not
                expecting.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a repeat of the buffet meal at the villa tonight.
                We were taken up by car with a group of three who we have spoken to a couple of
                times in the last few days and were joined by another couple of people who are
                staying in the same place as us as well as the 11 Taiwanese that turned up
                today. Having a few people to talk to meant it was a much more enjoyable evening
                than the last one we went to and once again, the food was very good.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st November
                </span>Our last three dives at Tulamben today. We started as usual with the
                early morning wreck dive (slightly later than usual as we had to wait for the
                result of the Liverpool v Swansea game!). A very good dive as always. Not so
                many bump-heads today but we saw a couple of ghost pipe fish at the front of the
                wreck that we had not seen before and also had a frog fish pointed out to us by
                one of the TWD guides.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had breakfast at the restaurant before our second dive of the day at
                Drop-off. There was quite a bit of current here today and we could not get as
                far along the wall as usual. We also had to fight current to get back to the
                exit point and ended up ending the dive relatively early (67 minutes).
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive was very good again. We tried to re-find the harlequin shrimp
                without success but did find four ghost pipe fish. There was no current so we
                could enjoy our last trip round the wreck where we did manage to find the frog
                fish and the yellow box fish. We had considered doing another dive before
                leaving tomorrow but decided against it so washed all our gear and carried it
                back to the room to try and dry it before tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going out for the evening. We
                stopped at the dive centre to pay our bill before going out to Safety Stop to
                eat for the last time. We had a couple of drinks in there with the people we
                were talking to last night before returning to the room and drinking slightly
                more rum than we had planned to.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 2nd November
                </span>We were collected from where we were staying just before 10:00 for the
                journey back to Kuta. We had expected a three hour journey but it took less than
                three and we were in our hotel before 1:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had booked a room for three nights in Satriya Cottages
                on Poppies II about 50m from the beach. We went straight out for lunch
                (McDonald's!) after putting our luggage in the room and then walked out to a
                supermarket to stock up on drinks, etc. Spent the rest of the afternoon by the
                pool.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks again in the evening. We had a couple of beers on the
                balcony and then found an Italian restaurant that we have not been to before.
                The food in there was excellent and we will definitely be going back. We had a
                beer in Bali Agung, a bar/restaurant that has had about the cheapest beer in
                Bali since we started coming here, and returned to the room for a few more.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 3rd November
                </span>We had to change rooms this morning.&nbsp; The air-con in the first room
                seemed to be working but was not making the room cooler. After complaining
                several times, they moved us to another room. This worked out quite well as the
                new room was much better all round. It was another day of not doing much apart
                from reading or lying by the pool. I went for a run along the beach at 5ish. It
                was the first time I have run since June and also the first time I have run
                since hurting my knee in Tioman.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate out at the same Italian as yesterday (Casa Mancini) before heading off to
                try and find somewhere to watch the football. We saw the second half of Man U. v
                Arsenal in Bali Agung but did not want to stay in there for Swansea v Chelsea as
                it was going to close at half time. We looked at a couple of other places that
                were showing it but none of them had commentary and they were also likely to
                close before the end of the game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Everywhere in Kuta seemed to be very hot and we are both
                getting fed up with the local beer so we eventually gave up, bought another
                bottle of rum and returned to the room. Could not get the game on our tele but
                followed it on the laptop instead.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th November
                </span>Our last full day in Bali and another day without a lot to do. We will be
                on a live-aboard diving trip for most of the next two weeks so spent the day
                reading and making the most of the free time. We left the hotel in the evening
                to buy a few more things from the supermarket and to have a last look at the
                Kuta sunset. We ate out again at Casa Mancini and had an earlier (and more
                sober) night than the previous few.</p>
