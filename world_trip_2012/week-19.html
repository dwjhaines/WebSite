            Two local dives today. For the first, we were at the 
			dive centre by 8:30. The dive site was only about 10 minutes away by 
			boat so we were in the water by 9:00. Roz and I were diving on our 
			own with an Indonesian guide (whose name we did not find out) who 
			did not speak a lot of English. The dive was not too spectacular. We 
			were not expecting anything to match the diving at Komodo but there 
			was a lot less to see here than at other places we have dived around 
			Bali. It was still nice enough and the vis was excellent but just 
			not a lot to see. We had a few hours back at the resort between 
			dives during which time we made a few plans about what we will be 
			doing for the next few weeks.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back out again at 1:30. Again, the dive was not wonderful 
			but still reasonably enjoyable. We are in another place where the 
			diving does not take up the whole of the day meaning Roz has plenty 
			of time to visit the turtle hatchery! We had a few drinks in the 
			evening. We had a couple of beers on the balcony while writing up 
			log books before eating in the same place as yesterday. One more 
			beer when we got back to the room and were in bed by about 11.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 2nd October </span>
            Two dives today at Menjangan which were much, much 
			better than yesterday's. After watching three of the turtle 
			hatchlings being released on the beach, we had a one hour trip by 
			boat to get to Menjangan. The boat was half full (five people on a 
			boat that can take 10) so although it was small, there was plenty of 
			room. We were supposed to be diving on our own with Wayan but due to 
			a bit of confusion at the beginning, we were joined by Isabelle as 
			well. We saw five leaf scorpion fish at the start of the dive before 
			descending along a wall covered with soft and hard corals in very 
			good condition. Not a huge amount of fish but a really scenic, 
			relaxing, easy dive with lots of huge sea-fans along the way. Lunch 
			was on the boat before the second dive which was probably better 
			again than the first one had been. The whole dive was along a 
			spectacular wall, again with plenty of spectacular coral formations.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back at the resort by 3ish giving us plenty of time before 
			the turtle feeding at 17:00. Each evening, the hatchlings are given 
			handfuls of cut up fish and the hawksbill gets whole fish. You make 
			donations to the project when you go and see the turtles and another 
			if you want to release one of the hatchlings. </p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had a similar evening to yesterday but with a bit more to drink as we are not diving tomorrow.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pAQPvYd7ZfE/UG1OCB4YkmI/AAAAAAAAGZM/sqGLVxh1N4o/s320/IMG_3811.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 3rd October </span>
            A day off diving. We were not too hung-over after last 
			night's alcohol. I spent a lot of the day sat on our balcony editing 
			the photos from the Komodo trip while Roz was at the beach. We got 
			take-aways from a warung over the road for lunch but apart from 
			that, did not leave the resort until the evening.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			After turtle feeding time, we walked a couple of miles along the 
			main road to a Balinese temple. The temple was not the most 
			spectacular we have ever seen but there is some sort of festival 
			taking place at the moment and we managed to get into the temple for 
			a fifteen minute ceremony. We did not really know what was going but 
			there was plenty of chanting and preying and it was all quite 
			interesting.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were back at Reef Seen by 7:30 and ate in our usual restaurant 
			before a relatively early night.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 4th October </span>
            Two more local dives today but, before the first dive, 
			it was time for Roz to release one of the turtle hatchlings. She 
			selected one of the ones that are 2 - 3 months old and carried it 
			down to the beach. She put the turtle about six inches from the 
			water. It did not seem to know what to do at first but it 
			eventually made its way into the water and after a few minutes it 
			was swimming out to sea. 
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			The first dive was a beach dive just in front of the resort. This 
			was an OK dive without anything too exciting. The second dive was a 
			muck dive a bit further along the beach and was a very good dive. We 
			were dropped off by boat near a jetty and made our way back towards 
			the resort. It was a shallow dive so we were in the water for 85 
			minutes. Loads to see including four ghost pipe fish and another 
			frog fish.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			Did not do too much for the rest of the day. We did get a taste of 
			Balinese dancing in the evening. Local schools do a performance for 
			tourists that takes place in the restaurant area of our hotel. I 
			lasted about 10 minutes before returning to my beer on the balcony.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F28cD7ik1n4/UHFJNC_yWUI/AAAAAAAAGmo/owlwTCkO5EU/s320/IMG_3893.JPG"></a></b></font></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 5th October </span>
            We did two more dives at Menjangan today. We had been 
			unsure whether to dive again or not as the diving is quite expensive 
			here but agreed that it was somewhere that we are unlikely to return 
			to so thought we may as well go for it. This turned out to be a good 
			move as the first dive was the best we have done here. There were 
			strong currents but these bought in a lot of schools of bigger fish 
			including huge tuna and giant travallies. There were three other 
			English divers on the boat and at least two of them described it as 
			the worst dive they had ever done because of the currents. We kept 
			our views about the dive to ourselves! The second dive was also good 
			- very similar to the dives we did on Tuesday in roughly the same 
			part of the island.
			</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had a few drinks again in the evening - a couple of beers on the 
			balcony before going out, a couple more with tea (at the same place 
			for the sixth night in a row) and a few more when we got back. Both 
			quite pissed by the time we got to bed sometime around midnight.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KpwPsH9WLWc/UHFIg4ykIRI/AAAAAAAAGmc/iR11beHmHFM/s320/IMG_3960.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 6th October </span>
            After breakfast, Roz released a second turtle. This one 
			was a bit keener on getting in the sea than the first one and headed 
			off with very little help. The turtle hatchery has definitely been 
			the one of the highlights of Roz's trip so far!</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We paid our bill and stocked up drinks from the supermarket by the 
			hotel as we did not know how easy it would be to buy things in 
			Tulamben, our next destination. We said our good-byes to Amanda and 
			Adrian and were collected by a car from Tulamben Wreck Divers just 
			before 11. We had a three hour drive to get to Tulamben and were in 
			our room just behind the dive centre by 2:00. We had booked to stay 
			here for five nights but were thinking about staying longer. Once we 
			saw the room, we were both fairly sure that we did want to stay 
			longer. It is a big room with a large fridge and is a few metres 
			away from the swimming pool. It is just over the road from Bali's 
			most famous dive site, the Liberty wreck and we should be able to 
			dive very cheaply here. As we have all our own equipment, and are 
			happy to dive without a guide, dives should only cost about £5 each. 
			We ate at the TWD restaurant and then spent an hour or so by the 
			pool.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had planned to go out at 7:30 to try and find somewhere showing 
			the Sunderland v Man City game. However, all the electric went off 
			in Tulamben at 6:20 and was still off when the game kicked off. We 
			had a few drinks while sat on our balcony and went out anyway at 
			about 8:30. The electric returned at about 8:45 by which time we 
			were sat in "The Safety Stop". There was a T.V. in there so we were 
			able to watch the second half. We waited in there after the game to 
			see if they would have the Swansea v Reading game at 10:00. They 
			didn't so we returned to the room and followed the game on the 
			laptop while listening to Soccer Saturday.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 7th October </span>
            Did not do a lot in the morning. We had decided not to 
			dive today as we wanted to have a few drinks with the football last 
			night. We had quite a late breakfast and stayed in the room or by 
			the pool until midday. We were told at breakfast that there would be 
			a cremation ceremony taking place in Tulamben today. In Bali, the 
			cremation is something to be celebrated. Many people are cremated at 
			the same time and over a thousand people turned up to this one. It 
			was a strange ceremony but fascinating to watch - we were there for 
			about three hours in total.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QFZmXysyauo/UHF7ttQD3KI/AAAAAAAAGm4/_vj5hOIFMuQ/s320/IMG_3999.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
Initially there was a procession with everyone going to the 
			cremation walking through the centre of the village towards the 
			cemetery. Most people were dressed in traditional costumes and were 
			carrying some sort of offering so this in itself was a very 
			colourful sight. When we got to the cemetery, a wooden platform had 
			been set up. Two large bulls made from something like papier mache 
			were carried in and put on the platform. A large funeral tower was 
			then carried into the cemetery containing the bodies. The bodies 
			were taken from the tower via a very precarious looking set of steps 
			while live chickens were thrown into the crowd. The bulls were then 
			cut open and the bodies were placed inside as well as most of the 
			offerings. This all took a couple of hours and seemed very chaotic 
			and disorganised.
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wQYvbBow_Tk/UHF9tNCBK4I/AAAAAAAAGnA/dDTgtDkzON4/s320/IMG_4018.JPG"></a></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We 
			were expecting some sort of service or announcement but once the 
			last of the offerings had been placed around the bulls the whole 
			thing was lit and went up in flames within a couple of minutes. The 
			whole thing had been very bizarre but also very interesting to 
			watch.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had not expected this to have taken up so much of the day - we 
			did not get back to our room until 4ish. We went out to eat (at The 
			Safety Stop again) quite early as we had missed lunch and had a 
			fairly early night.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We think we have managed to book an additional four nights here 
			meaning that we will stay until Monday 15th. However, someone else 
			is booked into our room from the 11th and the place is pretty full 
			so we are not 100% sure what is happening.</p>
