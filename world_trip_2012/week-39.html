                </span>After waking up I went through all my luggage again looking for my phone.
                Still no sign of it. I sent Caroline at Casa Carolina an e-mail asking if
                someone could look in the safe. We had an excellent breakfast and headed off to
                the dive centre by 9. We filled in all the paperwork but could not go out due to
                the wind and waves again. We were told to come back at midday when there was a
                50-50 chance that we would be able to dive.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel. Spent most of the morning reading - Roz on the beach
                and me in the room (it was too windy for me on the beach). I had an e-mail from
                Caroline saying my phone had been found in the safe (meaning a drive back to
                Xcalak for me). We returned to the dive centre at 12:00 but if anything the
                weather had got worse. Even if we could of gone out, the conditions did not look
                particularly appealing and I was not that bothered that we could not go. We will
                try again tomorrow. We went into Mahuhual for lunch and returned to the hotel
                again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                With not too much else to do, I made the 150km journey to Xcalak and back to
                collect my phone, an uneventful journey. I was back at Balamku Inn by about
                3:45, a round trip of about 2.5 hours.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked to "Travel Inn", one of the local restaurants in the evening. This was
                a nicer restaurant the ones we usually eat in and we had a pretty good meal.
                However, since we have been in Mexico it has almost seemed that the less you pay
                for a meal, the better the food so we will be back on the cheap Mexican food
                tomorrow!</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-G24kbgc_p4I/USP6UjtT4hI/AAAAAAAAJz0/0trlKwHRY08/s320/IMG_7443.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th February
                </span>A slightly better day weather wise today although still not great. The
                wind had dropped sufficiently for us to be able to dive but we had a few heavy
                rain showers and it was still pretty cold at times.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove to the dive centre after breakfast and were told we could dive. There
                were only two other customers on the boat together with the guide and two DMT's.
                Although we all dived on one group, we were mainly with the DMT's while the
                guide looked after the other two. The two dives were better than expected given
                the conditions of the last couple of days. The vis was good and although there
                was not a huge amount to see, there was enough to of made the diving worth doing
                - the highlight being a large hawksbill turtle on the first dive. It rained
                heavily during the surface interval but other than that, the weather was not too
                bad throughout the trip.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We hung up our gear at the dive centre and went into town for lunch again. The
                town centre in Mahahual is a bit strange. Most places are there purely to cater
                for the cruise ships that turn up about every other day. From being only a
                handful of tourists around yesterday, today there were several thousand
                (although most of them do not venture outside of the port area apparently).
                Apparently restaurants have menus with different prices so everything is more
                expensive on the cruise ship days. The place where we got our pork sandwiches
                did not seem to be too badly affected by this however and once again, we had a
                superb, very cheap meal. We returned to the dive centre to collect our gear and
                then drove back to the hotel.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent a couple of hours back at the room listening to the evening's football
                from home and reading. We drove back into town in the evening and ate at Nohoch
                Kay again. After driving back to the hotel we had a couple of drinks in the room
                before bed.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mlki-YJXz6s/USeAFBBSL1I/AAAAAAAAJ7k/dw_u7q9CoN4/s320/IMG_7461.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th February
                </span>I was awake at 6:30 and for the first time since we arrived here three
                days ago, it was warm enough to sit on the balcony as the sun came up. It is a
                bit of a shame that we have had one of the nicest balconies that we have ever
                had and we have not been able to use it at all in the evening. We had breakfast
                at 8 and spent the rest of the morning on the balcony or on the beach.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                This is the third place we have stayed that have been quite similar i.e. small
                hotels right on the beach (Tulum and Xcalak being the other two). This has been
                by far my favourite of the three. It is less than half the price of Tulum (for
                room, food and everything else) and is in a much better location for shops and
                restaurants than Xcalak. Of the three, it is the only one we would probably
                consider coming back to.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out at midday and began our journey back towards Cancun and
                ultimately, back to London. We had a 300km drive to Playa del Carmen where we
                had planned to stay the night before continuing to Cancun tomorrow. Once again,
                the journey was uneventful with good empty roads most of the way. We stopped for
                empanadas in Tulum at the same stall we had lunch at almost a month ago and
                arrived in Playa at about 3:30. We had no definite idea about where we were
                going to stay in Playa but as we drove in, spotted a motel type place. Roz
                checked the rooms while I turned the car round. It is a bit old but well located
                and is fine for one night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking in, we walked out to the supermarket to get a couple of things
                for tonight before returning to the room for showers. We had a few drinks in the
                room before going out souvenir shopping. We bought a few things from the
                souvenir shops on "Fifth Avenue" and then ate at a restaurant round the corner
                from the hotel. We returned to the room and finished the Bacardi I had bought in
                Chetumal.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st February
                </span>We checked out of the hotel at mid-day and continued driving North. We
                reached Cancun airport within about an hour, again a straight-forward uneventful
                journey. We returned the hire car to Alamo without any problems and walked to
                the terminal to check in for our flight to Fort Lauderdale. We had a couple of
                hours to kill after checking in. We ate lunch after going through to the gates
                and spent the remainder of our Mexican money in the souvenir and duty free
                shops.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Our flight left on time at 15:55 and we landed at Fort Lauderdale about 90
                minutes later at 18:20 local time. We got through immigration a lot quicker than
                expected and were outside the airport by 7:00. We had booked to stay at a
                Holiday Inn Express about a mile from the airport. Roz phoned the hotel
                and their shuttle bus picked us up about 15 minutes later.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After showering, we went out for a walk around the shopping mall over the road
                from the hotel. There was not a huge amount of shops there but it did have
                everything we needed. We both need to buy warmer clothes for our trip back to
                England and there were a few cheap outlet shops. I managed to buy jeans. Roz
                will go back tomorrow when she has worked out what size she needs to buy over
                here. There was also a large supermarket there which will be useful when we go
                back to the same hotel on our return from London on Monday. Unfortunately, the
                pizza restaurant that we were looking for had closed down so we made do with a
                sandwich from Subway before returning to the hotel.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd February
                </span>We had breakfast in the hotel before heading back to the mall to continue
                our shopping. Roz bought shoes and jeans (and a hat!). Things are a lot cheaper
                here than at home. Two pairs of jeans and Roz's shoes have cost a total of $40
                (about £26) They did not seem to be too many cold weather coats around so I will
                have a t-shirt and a thin hoody when I arrive in London! We booked the shuttle
                bus back to the airport for 1:00 and arranged a late check-out for 12:30.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We packed our luggage so most of it can be left in the hotel until we get back
                next week. We checked out at 12:30 and left our big bags in the luggage room
                meaning that we can travel to London and back with hand luggage only.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were picked up at 12:45 and were in the airport not
                long after 1:00. We were through security at the airport by 1:30 and went in
                search of the American Airlines lounge. Unfortunately they do not have one at
                Fort Lauderdale meaning that we had a three hour wait in the seats by the gate.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We tried to get on an earlier flight as ours was slightly delayed and we did not
                have much time for our connection but this was full. Our flight eventually took
                off about 30 minutes late at 5:00. The flight took about three hours and we
                eventually got off the plane in Dallas at 7:25 local time, an hour before our
                flight to Heathrow. There were lounges here so, after a bit of a dash around the
                airport, we were able to get a couple of drinks before boarding the plane. The
                flight left roughly on time at 8:30. We had a few bottles of wine on the plane
                before falling asleep at about 11:00 (5am UK time).</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23rd February
                </span>We were served breakfast after about four hours sleep and landed at
                Heathrow slightly early just after 11am. We got through the airport remarkably
                quickly and got the Heathrow Connect train into Paddington. We got into
                Paddington by 12:30 and were due to meet Cathy an hour later. Roz had a coffee
                while I went out to try and buy a coat without any success. We headed to The Mad
                Bishop and Bear just after 1:00 and Cathy joined us 30 minutes later.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After a couple of pints, we got the tube across to London Bridge and had a 10
                minute walk to "Think London Bridge" where we had booked a two bedroom apartment
                for the weekend. We were initially told that our room was not going to be ready
                for 1 - 2 hours but after about 15 minutes of arguing and a few phone calls, we
                were given an identical room that was ready. Why they did not do this as soon as
                we got there I have no idea.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I had showers and at about 4:30 we went off on a
                pub crawl. We stopped for a pint at The Horseshoe Arms which was around the
                corner from London Bridge and then got a train to City Thames Link on the other
                side of the river.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planed a walk that involved eight pubs and ended up back at London
                Bridge. We managed to complete all eight pubs - Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, The Old
                Bell, The Black Friar, Doggetts, The Founders Arms, The Old Thameside Inn, The
                Mud Lark and finally, The Market Porter. We stayed in the Market Porter until it
                closed, stopped for one in The Wheatsheaf and then walked back to the apartment.
                A very enjoyable evening!</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 24th February
                </span>I was up at 9ish and walked to Tesco to buy food for breakfast. We cooked
                breakfast in the apartment and headed out for the day at about 11:30. We got the
                train from London Bridge to Charing Cross and were at The Harp by 12:00. I had
                still not managed to buy anything warm to wear but yesterday was not too bad and
                I could not be bothered to do anything about it today. We had a couple of pints
                in The Harp before moving to The Chandos for a couple more.

                We had no great desire to drink in the pubs around Wembley but Julie, Becky, etc
                had been taken by bus directly to the ground so just after 2:00, we got the tube
                up to Wembley Park. We met up with them all in The Torch and stayed in there for
                a couple. The Torch had not got any better in the fifteen or so years since we
                last went in it - we did the right thing in drinking in London before coming out
                to Wembley! We left the pub at about 3:15 and were in our seats by about 3:45,
                just before kick-off.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The game itself could not of gone much better from a Swansea point of view. From
                very early on, it was very one-sided and it always looked as if they would win
                it comfortably. We had excellent seats so had a perfect view of everything. Once
                Swansea scored the second goal, the game was just about over and the third goal
                at the start of the second half confirmed it. Not the most exciting of games but
                no-one in the Swansea end was complaining. Final score Bradford 0, Swansea 5 and
                Swansea had won their first ever major trophy.

                We left the ground as the celebrations came to an end and made our way back to
                Wembley Park still not really believing what had happened. We got the tube back
                to Charing Cross by 7:30 and had a drink in the first pub we could find that was
                open (The Bear and Staff).</p>

                We had thought about another pub crawl but it was getting colder now and a few
                pubs in the area were closed on a Sunday evening. We were close to The Moon
                Under Water on Leicester Square so went in there for a drink and ended up eating
                there and staying for the rest of the evening. There were a few Swansea fans in
                there but it was mainly filled with Bradford fans. They were all enjoying
                themselves despite getting beaten and there was an excellent atmosphere in the
                place. We left the pub when it closed at 11:00 and got the train back to London
                Bridge.

                We would probably of carried on drinking if anywhere had still been open but
                everywhere seemed to have closed at the same time which was probably for the
                best! We were back in the apartment in time to see the highlights of the game on
                TV and got to bed at around midnight.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Once again, a very enjoyable evening and a superb day. We were always sure that
                we would come back for the final but were not 100% sure that it was the most
                sensible thing to do. However the 48 hours or so we will have had in London have
                been excellent and coming back has definitely been worth while.
