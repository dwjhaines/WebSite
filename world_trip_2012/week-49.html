                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 29th April
                </span>Our flight to Ambon left on time at 1:30. The flight was about three
                hours. I was asleep before the plane had taken off and managed to sleep almost
                all the way. We got to Ambon at 6:30 local time and were met by a driver from
                Maluku Divers who took us to the resort about 10 minutes away. We had breakfast
                as soon as we arrived and filled out all the paperwork before being shown to our
                room. We were told that we would be able to start diving on the second dive of
                the day at 11:00 which was a bit of a bonus - we had not expected to start until
                this afternoon.
            </p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-glIrsuxxEUs/UYdZN1Y8PEI/AAAAAAAALXE/Gl5BRIxdx2w/s320/IMG_9057.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The resort consists of a dive centre and ten bungalows. There is not really any
                beach but the rooms all have big balconies facing the sea. We have the room
                furthest from the dive centre but it is only a couple of metres away from the
                sea. The rooms are really nice with plenty of space as well as our own "camera
                stations" with plenty of sockets for charging batteries, etc. It is definitely a
                step up in quality from similar places we have stayed in before in Indonesia.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The first dive was a bit disappointing. Ambon is famous for its muck diving but
                we did not really see anything. There were quite strong currents which made it
                difficult to look for things and it was not that enjoyable a dive. We had lunch
                back at the resort before the afternoon dive at 3:30. This was better. We saw a
                couple of frog fish, a sea-horse and two ribbon eels but it still was not a
                wonderful dive. We are hoping for better tomorrow!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz had her new camera on the second dive. She had taken the empty housing down
                on the first dive to check it was OK before taking the camera underwater.
                Everything seemed to be working which was quite a relief given the amount of
                hassle we had been through to get the camera.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th April
                </span>A much better days diving today. We left the resort by van at 8:45 as the
                sea was too rough just to walk out to the boat. We were taken to a jetty about 5
                minutes away where the two dive boats were waiting for us. We were on the same
                boat as yesterday. Once again, we were diving with Semuel, an Indonesian dive
                guide. We had one other diver with us today for the first two dives and one more
                for the final dive. We stayed out on the boat for the first two dives, returned
                to the resort for lunch and then went out for the afternoon dive. I think this
                will be the pattern for the next few days.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nsSSvu1s-qs/UYdZWbgCebI/AAAAAAAALXg/rbD5jljU1JA/s320/IMG_9174.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first two dives were at "Laha 3" and "Rhino Point". These were both
                excellent dives - proper muck diving.&nbsp; We saw all sorts of rare and weird
                fish - rhinopia, stone-fish, demon stingers, as well as sea-horses, cuttle fish,
                shrimps, ribbon eels, etc. There was a lot less current than yesterday so it was
                easier to stop and look at everything and take pictures.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive of the day was at "Jetty Air Manis" which
                was also good if not quite as good as the previous two. We saw a couple of
                sea-moths here as well as leaf scorpion fish and stone fish again. This site
                also had a bit of coral reef so the end of the dive featured plenty of more
                normal looking fish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the resort at 5ish so had a couple of hours sorting out cameras
                and photos, etc before the evening meal which is served at 7:30. After eating,
                we were back in the room by 9:00. There is not much to do at the resort in the
                evening, but as most people here are spending more than four hours a day
                underwater, most people are asleep by 10:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 1st May
                </span>Another very good days diving. We had a very similar day to yesterday
                apart from the fact that we also did a night dive. The three day dives were at
                "Nama Slope", "Nama Pos" and "Air Manis" again with lunch back at the resort
                between the second and third dive. We were diving with Tim and Kat again and
                were still being guided by Semuel.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jHxWGKcryVg/UYdZMHp9hPI/AAAAAAAALW8/3h9srud58YU/s320/IMG_9360.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first dive had sea-horses, lots of small cuttle fish and spearing mantis
                shrimps. The start of the second dive was excellent with two giant frog fish, a
                smaller frog fish and three leaf scorpion fish. The second half of the dive was
                spent looking for and photographing boxer crabs. We have only ever seen one or
                two of these but saw three on this dive. The third dive of the day was not as
                good but we still saw another sea-horse and a few nudibranchs.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The night dive at "Kampung Baru" was probably the best dive of the day and one
                of the best night dives we have ever done. It was just us, Kat and Semuel on
                this dive and there was loads to see. We saw three star-gazers, loads of
                cuttlefish including one flamboyant, plenty of shrimps and crabs, one of the
                smallest frog fish we have ever seen and a Spanish dancer. An excellent end to
                the days diving.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                A later night than usual tonight due to the night dive. We were not back at the
                resort until gone 9:00 and not back in the room until after 10:00!</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LmJuby8cX3U/UYdZT06zYbI/AAAAAAAALXM/G-G9y59rIQo/s320/IMG_9524.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd May
                </span>Three more pretty good dives today. A few of the people we have been
                diving with have either left or are about to leave so we were on the small boat
                today with one other couple, Tan and Liling from Singapore. We were still led by
                Semuel who has been an excellent guide so far. The three dives today were at
                "Laha 1.5", "Kampung Baru" and "Rhino City".
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive of the day was probably the best. We were
                diving near a pier and there was loads of rubbish and junk n the water but also
                loads of stuff living amongst it all. There was one metal cabinet of some sort
                that we could easily of spent the whole dive at. It was full of morays, yellow
                box fish of all sizes, shrimps and a stone fish sat on the bottom. We also saw a
                harlequin shrimp.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Loads of stuff on the second dive as well including a filamented ghost pipe fish
                which we have never seen before. On the third dive we were looking for the
                rhinopias again but we got pushed away from them by the current. Parts of this
                dive were not great but it improved towards the end and it was a very good dive
                for photographing things. We decided against another night dive so had finished
                by 5:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd May
                </span>Another similar day and another good days diving. We did four dives again
                today including the night dive. We did the first two dives with Tan and Liling.
                These were their last dives again as they leave tomorrow. The afternoon dive we
                were on our own with Semuel although we were diving with another group. The
                first dive at "Pantai Parigi 2", was not that good. There is some reef diving
                here but the reefs are no-where near as good as elsewhere so they are fairly
                pointless. We did see a pygmy sea-horse but not too much else of any great
                interest.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WPbplTvrisA/UYdZU_xXucI/AAAAAAAALXY/r3eU_75QsN0/s320/IMG_9760.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The second dive at "Jetty Dark Blue" was back to muck diving and was a lot
                better. The end of the dive around the pier was excellent. We saw four frog fish
                in total including one tiny orange one which was probably the highlight of the
                dive. The third dive at Quarter Point was not has good as the second but was
                still pretty good. Roz counted five ribbon eels and there were a lot more
                nudibranches than we have seen here so far.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The best dive of the day was the night dive at "Laha 1.5" - also known as "The
                Twilight Zone". We were guided by Lily for this dive. We had one other diver in
                the group although she went and joined another group for some reason early in
                the dive leaving just the three of us.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Again, there was loads to see on this dive. All sorts of weird creatures,
                shrimps and crabs. Again, the frog fish were probably the highlight. We all
                managed to find one. Roz managed to find a Hairy Frog Fish which has not been
                seen here for a few weeks and we have only ever seen one of them before. It was
                another late night and we were not back in the room until 10:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 4th May
                </span>There are not many people left at the resort now apart from six Russians,
                us and Noriko from Japan. We were diving with Noriko today (the Russians have
                their own boat) and were led by Lily again. The dives were OK today without
                being as spectacular as some of the others here. We dived "Laha 3", "The Tower"
                and "Laha 1.5".</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-m6sjlBzTrR0/UYdZXqibxXI/AAAAAAAALXo/M46vwgSCzkI/s320/IMG_9855.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On the first dive we saw a couple of sea-horses and a purple rhinopia. We were
                keen on seeing rhinopia again as we hardly ever see these and they are an
                incredibly strange fish to look at. The second dive was not that good. We
                were&nbsp; shown loads of tiny nudibranchs and crabs that were only just
                visible. It was impossible to get photos of them as they were so small and I
                think I have seen enough of such things now.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive back at our favourite Ambon site was pretty good although not as
                good as the other dives here. The current had picked up a bit again, making it
                harder to look at things. There was still plenty to see including four harlequin
                shrimps. A couple of these were smaller than any we have seen before. We also
                saw another frog fish and plenty of snake eels and the small yellow box fish
                again.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had not planned to do a night dive today but between the first and second
                dives, Lily persuaded us that conditions would be good to do a night dive at the
                house reef in front of the resort. This turned out to be very wrong! We went
                into the water at about 6:30 and had to abort the dive after about 35 minutes.
                The current was too strong to be able to look at anything and there was a risk
                of us being carried off the site (albeit a very small risk). We all managed to
                get split up on the way back to the resort so not a great dive all round.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After we had eaten, we returned to the room to follow four hours of football on
                the internet. The connection was not good enough for radio and certainly not for
                streaming video but it was just about good enough to keep track of what was
                going on. We finished what we had left of our bottle of Sang Som while following
                the Championship games on the balcony, and moved inside for the Premier League
                games. Eventually got to bed at about 1am.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 5th May
                </span>We could only do the two morning dives today as we fly out of Ambon
                tomorrow lunchtime. As it was our last day, we got to choose the dive sites so
                we went to Rhino City and Pantai Nama Pos again. We were guided by Semuel again
                today and also had Noriko with us. Also on the boat was a Swiss couple who had
                arrived at the resort yesterday.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had chosen the first site as it was our last chance to see the rhinopia. We
                could not find them at the start of the dive and I had just about given up on
                seeing one but Roz spotted one when we were up in the shallows after about 40
                minutes. There were also quite a lot of bigger nudibranchs in the shallow part
                of the reef.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Pantai Nama Pos was just as good as when we did it the first time. We saw cuttle
                fish, nudibranchs and three large frog fish. The giant green frog fish was
                excellent again. We saw a couple of boxer crabs right at the end of the dive -
                an ideal way to finish our diving here.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the resort, we washed and hung up all our gear before having lunch. For
                the first time in a week, we had a few hours with not a lot to do so I was able
                to spend the afternoon sorting out some of the many photos we have taken since
                we got here. We spent a couple of hours in the restaurant in the evening but
                were still back in the room before 10:00.</p>
