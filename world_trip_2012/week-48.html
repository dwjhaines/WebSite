                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 22nd April
                </span>A bad start to the day. As we were getting ready to go in for the first
                dive, I noticed water in Roz's camera housing. It was fresh water from the rinse
                tank so the camera may dry out and be OK but it will probably need replacing.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Things did get better after that. We did our last dive in The Similans at
                Christmas Point. This was a pretty good dive again although probably not as good
                as some of the dives yesterday. We headed North from The Similans to Koh Bon
                where we did two dives at Koh Bon Ridge.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">This used to be the best place in Thailand to see manta
                rays and they were just about guaranteed to be here in March and April. However,
                there have been very few around in the last couple of years and we did not see
                any on either dive. We went further out along the ridge than we have been on the
                second dive and again, both dives were enjoyable despite the lack of mantas.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DgIZ0hUN5EA/UXetWIdPObI/AAAAAAAALJo/vWOU9jE0SXw/s320/IMG_8825.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The final dive of the day was further North again at Koh Tachai Pinnacle.
                We have had some horrendous dives here in the past due to the strong currents
                but the conditions today were better than we have ever had here and this was the
                best dive of the day.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                It was possible to swim all round the pinnacle and over the top whereas in the
                past we have had to shelter on one side or the other to avoid current. There
                were loads more fish here as well than previous years including travally,
                barracuda and a huge school of batfish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Another quiet evening back on the boat and we were in bed before 10:00.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 23rd April
                </span>We had travelled overnight to Richelieu Rock, a dive site about three
                hours North of Tachai. This is about the best dive site in Thailand and we were
                to do three dives here. Wake-up was at 6am so that we could complete the three
                dives and have time to get back to Tachai for the fourth dive of the day. All
                three dives at Richelieu were superb.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wxnmz-QwSI0/UXlSNicXHAI/AAAAAAAALKA/WaryYvxOh0k/s320/IMG_8865.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have been very lucky with the conditions on this trip so far and the luck
                continued today. The visibility was very good for al three dives. The numbers of
                fish on the site was incredible with huge schools of snapper, fusiliers and
                smaller bait fish. The were large numbers of travallies and tuna hunting in
                amongst them all as well as all the macro stuff such as the sea-horse, ghost
                pipe fish and harlequin shrimps. Probably the best days diving we have ever had
                at this site.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had an early lunch before travelling back to Koh Tachai. Here the conditions
                had changed a lot since yesterday - the strong currents that we were used to at
                the site were back. It was a bit chaotic getting down the rope to the top of the
                pinnacle but we all made it and managed to have a reasonably enjoyable 47 minute
                dive.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8iHZTNTfAyY/UXu1yO5_UNI/AAAAAAAALU0/IsPoXNNmN-8/s320/IMG_8928.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 24th April
                </span>After the last dive yesterday, we had continued travelling South to the
                Boonsung Wreck near Khao Lak. We did both the last two dives of the trip here
                this morning. The dives were very similar to each other. Not as good vis as
                further North but all the usual stuff on the wreck - nudis, morays, scorpion
                fish, etc. Also plenty of big schools of fish swimming around just above the
                wreck.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                &nbsp;We were out of the water after the second dive by 11:15 and had an hour or
                so to dry our equipment while we had lunch, paid for our nitrox, exchanged
                e-mail addresses, etc. We were back at Tap Lamu pier just after 1pm. It was the
                end of a very good trip. We had been unsure about whether or not to do another
                Similans trip as we have done them the last few years during shorter holidays.
                The diving on this trip however, was better than it has been for years. We had
                better weather, better vis, more fish and longer dives. It was a good crowd of
                people on the boat again and the whole trip had been very enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were taken by minibus back to Phuket. We had booked four nights at a hotel in
                Kamala, somewhere that we have not been to before. The place we stayed at before
                Christmas has become more expensive so we needed to find somewhere else. Kamala
                seems nice enough although not as nice as Nai Yang. The hotel is just as good
                however, and we have a better view from our balcony. We had a quick walk around
                the area outside the hotel and spent the rest of the day on the balcony or in
                the room.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had not had any alcohol for the last 11 days so decided to have a few
                tonight. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before going out to eat and
                then a couple of bottles of Sang Som in the room when we got back.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 25th April
                </span>A frustrating day trying to find a replacement for Roz's camera. At about
                11:30, we got a very slow local bus into Phuket Town and then another out
                to a couple of big shopping centres that had been recommended to us. It soon
                became obvious that it was not going to be possible to just replace the camera
                as it is now out of date. The newer models do not fit in the underwater housing
                so we will have to replace that as well but very few places actually had any
                housings. The only option appears to be buying a Canon S100 which is a good
                camera but is not really what Roz is looking for. We gave up by about 2:30 and
                got a taxi back to Kamala. After sending a couple of e-mails, I went back to
                Patong to look at the shopping centre there. This trip involved a lot of
                walking, a lift there on a motorcycle and a taxi back but it was also not very
                successful. I did find a cheaper camera and housing but this gets mixed reviews
                so we are not sure about this one.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back in Kamala, we booked ourselves onto a local diving trip for tomorrow and
                returned to the room to think about the options again. We ate in the hotel
                restaurant which was a much better meal than the one we had last night.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 26th April
                </span>I opened my birthday and anniversary cards before having breakfast and we
                walked to the dive centre (about 50m away)&nbsp; for 8:45. We were diving from a
                long-tail boat which left from the beach in front of our hotel. We were diving
                on our own with Matthew, a Maltese DM. We did both dives at Ko Weao, a site we
                have dived before from Nai Yang. The diving here is not the same quality as the
                Similans but both dives were good enough and it was an enjoyable way to start
                the day.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by about 2:00 and after we had showered and cleaned
                our equipment, we headed back to one of the shopping centres we had been to
                yesterday. Roz had used my camera on the dives this morning and got on
                reasonably well with it. The S100 is a similar model to mine so we decided that
                this was the best option. We thought that once we had made the decision, it
                would be reasonably straightforward but it ended up being a lot more stressful
                than it should of been. We got a taxi to the Central shopping centre and needed
                to go to two shops - one for the camera and one for the housing. We checked that
                the camera was still available from one shop before going to the Canon Centre
                for the housing. Here we were told that they did not have the housing and they
                would have to order one. Roz was close to tears at this point and it looked as
                if we had made a wasted trip. We told the shop assistant that we had been told
                yesterday that they did have the housing and after a bit of a discussion, he
                went off and found the last one in a cupboard.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once we had the housing, it was back to Banana IT for the camera. At one point,
                it looked as if we would not be able to get the camera as they did not have any
                boxed up. They eventually let us buy the one that was on display, the last one
                that they had as this camera has now been superseded by the S110. So, after a
                lot of hassle, we finally had both the camera and housing. The prices of both
                the housing and the camera had gone down since yesterday for some reason and we
                paid about £100 less than we were expecting to pay for the two items. It was
                gone 4:00 by this time and we had not had lunch so we went to McDonalds as this
                was the nearest option.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d1xwmAI0QDY/UXu1mDNGe9I/AAAAAAAALUs/6BrsFPNbWio/s320/IMG_9049.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus back to Patong and a taxi from there to Kamala. We were back at the
                hotel again by about 6:00. We had a couple of drinks while I opened my birthday
                presents and a couple more on the balcony before we went out. We had chosen the
                restaurant we wanted to eat in tonight but when we got there, it was closed.
                This did not work out too badly as we found another place which did the best
                food we have had since getting to Thailand. We got through a bottle of Sang Som
                with our meal and then went back to the room and continued drinking while
                watching a DVD of the League Cup Final. I fell asleep sometime around 12:30. A
                very enjoyable day all round!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 27th April
                </span>We woke at about 8:30 to find that our room had no electricity. It was
                not something that could be sorted out quickly so we had to move to the room
                next door. This did not work out too badly as the room we moved to is the one
                nearest the sea and has excellent views of the beach. The last couple of days
                have been quite hectic but today we did not have a lot to do so most of the day
                was spent in the room. I went out to get a hair cut in the afternoon and we also
                walked out to the post office to send home a box of things that we don't need to
                carry with us any more (mainly Roz's old camera and housing and a couple of my
                birthday presents).</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks again in the evening. We ate at the same place as last night
                before going back to the room to listen to Soccer Saturday.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 28th April
                </span>We had agreed a late check out when we booked the hotel so spent most of
                the day in the room without too much to do again. We had to change rooms again
                at midday but spent most of the day either reading in the room or making the
                most of the Wi-Fi.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We booked a taxi to take us to the airport at 5pm and an hour later we had
                checked in and gone through immigration. We were heading for Ambon via Jakarta.
                Our first flight was on Air Asia. This left just about on time at 7:30 and we
                arrived in Jakarta at about 10:30. We went through immigration, collected our
                luggage and got a shuttle bus from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Here we checked in
                for the 1:30 Lion Air flight to Ambon. By the time we had got something to eat,
                we only had about an hour to wait for the flight.</p>
