                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 3rd June
                </span>Back to doing three dives today. We were the only people diving again and
                this time, we were the only ones on the boat for both dives. The first dive was
                back at Pescador Island and another 35 - 40 minutes with the sardines. |They
                really are superb to watch. We went round the East side of the island when we
                left them and saw two more turtles by the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The afternoon dive started about 100 metres from the dive
                centre and ended in front of Chili Bar. We were led by Roly, the other dive
                guide here for this dive. We went in search of pygmy sea-horses again without
                success but did find two leaf scorpion fish and another turtle. We dived the
                house reef on our own again just after 4:30. We did the Southern part of the
                site again where there seems to be a lot more fish and we also saw three
                turtles.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After a day without alcohol, we had a few drinks again tonight. We ate at Chili
                Bar again and then came back to the room and drank a half bottle of rum on the
                balcony.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vOg5GyAbxaM/UbVQb013SgI/AAAAAAAANQM/NlQ2bOMpOqU/s320/IMG_1776.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th June
                </span>Another excellent dive at Pescador to start the day. Again we were the
                only two on the boat and we were led by Roly. We entered at the cathedral and
                swam all the way back round to the area with the sardines. We saw the electric
                clam again, the two frog fish, a yellow box fish and a turtle on the way. By the
                time we reached the sardines, I was down to 50 bar but still spent 15 minutes
                watching them before surfacing (on 20 bar). Roz spent 5 - 10 minutes longer
                watching them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The afternoon dive was at Kasay where we saw seven
                turtles. We also saw another three turtles on our evening dive on the house
                reef. One of these was a hawksbill, the first we have seen since getting to The
                Philippines.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate at Chili Bar again in the evening. The food in there is excellent and I
                don't think we will be trying anywhere else for the rest of our stay here. We
                had slightly more rum than usual when we got back to the room and don't clearly
                remember going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th June
                </span>Probably the best days diving we have had here. There were two other
                divers on the boat today but we were still diving on our own with Dhodho.
                Pescador seems to get better every day that we go there. The sardines were as
                good as ever today and there was a huge amount of fish along the wall after we
                had left them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The afternoon dive was at Talisay. We saw two ornate ghost
                pipe fish here, something we have not seen many of recently, and eleven turtles.
                On our evening dive on the house reef, there was quite strong current but we saw
                another seven turtles. At one point when we turned round, there seemed to be
                turtles everywhere. There seem to be a lot more around in the last couple
                of days due to the low tide.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Beer on the balcony while doing log books, pizzas at Chili Bar and a half bottle
                of rum when we got back. Another enjoyable evening!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th June
                </span>Our last days diving in Moalboal - we head to Malaysia tomorrow. We just
                did the two boat dives today. The resort is starting to get busier and there
                were four other divers on the boat but once again we were diving on our own with
                Dhodho. Pescador was as good as ever and we had our last look at the sardines.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at Kasay for the afternoon dive and Roz counted another ten turtles
                so a good dive to finish with (this bought the total number of turtles seen in
                The Philippines to 109!).</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went to Chili Bar for the final pizzas of our stay in The
                Philippines. We ate with Andrew and Chris, a couple of Canadians who have
                been on the boat with us for the last couple of days. We had a few beers there
                and did not leave until after 11. We had a few more drinks back at the room
                before getting to bed sometime around 1:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th June
                </span>Our flights out of Cebu had been moved so that instead of flying at
                midday, we were not leaving until 20:15. We had arranged an airport transfer
                with the dive centre and also a late check-out for 3pm. We did not have much to
                do all day apart from paying our bill and drying all dive gear.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up at exactly 3:00 for the three hour journey back to Cebu
                Airport. The nine days here has gone incredibly quickly and we have both really
                enjoyed staying here for a second time. The diving has been excellent again and
                we have really enjoyed the food - even if it has been mainly pizzas. With very
                cheap alcohol as well it really is an ideal place to stay.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were at the airport just after 6:00. We were heading for Kota Kinabalu via
                Manila and checked in for both flights without any problems. The first flight to
                Manila was a bit late but we were still in Manila by 10pm. We cleared
                immigration and went through to international departures to wait for our 11:40
                flight to Kota Kinabalu. There were quite a few problems at Manila due to an
                earlier storm. Lots of planes had been diverted from Manila to Clark and these
                had to be moved back to Manila before anyone could go anywhere. We were
                initially told we would have a 45 minute delay but we did not take off until
                after 2am - a delay of about two and a half hours.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th June
                </span>We eventually landed at K.K. at 4ish. We had booked a cheap hotel two
                minutes from the airport for one night and there was someone from the hotel to
                meet us after we had collected our luggage. By the time we had checked into our
                room it was about 4:30am. We both went straight to sleep.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We slept until 9:30 when we got up for breakfast. As soon as we had eaten, we
                checked out of the hotel and got a taxi into K.K. where we had booked two nights
                at the Le Meridian, a slightly nicer hotel. We were able to check straight into
                a room which is probably the nicest we will stay in now for the rest of the
                trip. It is certainly luxurious compared to where we will be staying next!</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour or so by the pool and then walked out to the Scuba Junkie
                office to sort out our diving for tomorrow. We had pre-booked a days diving so
                we took all our gear over there and filled out the paperwork. We stopped and had
                roti canai for lunch on the way back to the hotel before going to sleep for a
                couple of hours.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We stayed in K.K. thirteen years ago with Dave but a lot of it is unrecognisable
                from the place we stayed then. It is now quite a modern city with plenty more
                building work going on. We went for a bit of a walk round the night market
                before eating in the evening. This is probably one of the places that has not
                changed much since we were here last. It was all very colourful and interesting
                but we ended up eating in an Indian restaurant across the&nbsp; road from our
                hotel.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th June
                </span>Three dives in the "Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park" today. We walked to
                the dive centre stopping for roti canai for breakfast on the way. We were the
                only two customers on the boat and were guided by James from Newcastle. The
                dives were nothing special. Kota Kinabalu is not known for great diving and we
                did not have high expectations and the sites were certainly no-where near as
                good as where we are heading tomorrow. They were all still quite enjoyable and
                we did see a few big schools of fish, a few more bat fish and two more turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in K.K. by about 3:30 and carried all our wet
                gear back to the hotel to wash.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few drinks in the evening. Our room had good views of both the town and
                the sea so we bought a selection of drinks from the supermarket and spent most
                of the evening sat by our window. We only left the room briefly to eat at
                another Indian restaurant.</p>
