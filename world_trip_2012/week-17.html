			We left Kingsclere at 4:30pm and were at Heathrow just 
			before 6. The car was collected from Terminal 3 so within about 10 
			minutes of getting there, we had checked in and were on our way to 
			the BA lounge again. We had three and a half hours in the lounge, 
			the second half of which we spent watching the Man City champions 
			league game.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had boarded the plane by 10 and it took off a few minutes late at 
			about 10:30.No upgrades this time meaning that we were sat in 
			economy, but the flight was quite empty and we had plenty of space 
			so it was still quite comfortable. The service seemed to be a lot 
			better than it had been in business class and we got through quite a 
			few bottles of wine before falling asleep.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DCxlDS5Thtk/UFr4q4Xo2TI/AAAAAAAAGFE/IVgTYwKPcFo/s320/IMG_2945.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 19th September </span>
			We landed at Bangkok at 3:30pm and, after getting 
			through immigration and collecting our luggage, we got a taxi to the 
			Holiday Inn Express. We got a room on the 18th floor so had an 
			excellent view of Bangkok including the National Stadium.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We also 
			had a perfect view of another football ground that 
			is opposite the hotel. We went out to buy crisps and drinks (from 
			Tesco!) and then returned to the room to watch 
			บีอีซี-เทโรศาสน เอฟซี V บุรีรัมย์ ยูไนเต็ด BEC - (Tero Sasana FC. V&nbsp;Buriram United.) in the Toyota League Cup 
			quarter final 2nd leg. The game finished 2 - 2 meaning that บีอีซี-เทโรศาสน เอฟซี (managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson) were knocked out on away goals.</p>

<p  class="diary-text">
			<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);letter-spacing:normal">
			By the time the game had finished, it was almost 9:00. We walked out 
			to Siam Square and ate at Ban Khun Mae - probably our favourite 
			restaurant in Thailand. We drank a bottle of Sang Som (Thai whiskey) 
			with the meal and returned to the room where we drank another couple 
			of bottles. Got to bed sometime around 2am.</span></p>
			
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 20th September </span>
            Did not do a lot today. We got up for breakfast at 10 
			but then slept until about 12:30. We went out for a walk to Panthip 
			Plaza looking at cameras again and then walked back to the MBK for 
			lunch in the food hall. It rained quite heavily for a couple of 
			hours in the afternoon. By the time we went out in the evening, the 
			Siam Square area was completely flooded. We needed to buy malaria 
			tablets but getting to the pharmacist took a lot longer than 
			expected due to having to wade through puddles. By the time we got 
			to Watsons, the pharmacist had left for the day so we had to return 
			to the MBK where we got what we needed from Boots. We thought about 
			eating at MBK again but the food hall was closing up as we got there 
			so we returned to Siam Square (by which time a lot of the water had 
			gone) and ate at Ban Khun Mae for the second night in a row.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st September </span>
            After what seemed like only a few hours sleep, we were 
			up at 4am as we had booked ourselves onto the 6:15 flight to Bali. 
			We checked out of the hotel and got a taxi to the airport without 
			any problems and had checked in and gone through security by about 
			5am. We had breakfast before boarding the Air Asia plane which left 
			on time. The flight took just over four hours and we landed in Bali 
			at 11:30 local time. Everything went reasonably smoothly at the 
			airport and within an hour we got got through immigration, collected 
			our luggage and had managed to withdraw money from both of our 
			accounts.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We were staying the night at a Holiday Inn that is only about 500m 
			from the airport. This was booked using the loyalty points that I 
			get for using my credit card. We had planned to walk to the hotel 
			but realised that we would have to go quite a long way round and 
			ended up getting a taxi for about £2. We had to wait about 20 
			minutes for our room to be ready but it is an excellent hotel with a 
			very nice pool right next to the beach. Spent the rest of the 
			afternoon lying by the pool.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-acB4REVyvj8/UFxmfNN3V7I/AAAAAAAAGFc/b-3m6iW9z5w/s320/IMG_2971.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
At 
			5:30, we walked into the centre of Kuta which is about 1.5 miles 
			away from where we are staying. There is a footpath that goes all 
			the way along the top of the beach so we were able to take in the 
			views of the sun setting on the way.
</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We left the beach when the sun disappeared and wandered round the 
			Poppies lanes for half an hour or so looking for bars or restaurants 
			that we used to visit when we have stayed here previously. A lot of 
			places have changed beyond recognition or been completely demolished 
			and rebuilt. We managed to find a pizza place that we have been 
			going to for years and ate there again before walking back to the 
			hotel.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			By the time we were back at the hotel we were both totally 
			worn out. The combination of the alcohol consumed in the last week 
			together with the travelling and the lack of sleep seems to have 
			caught up with us. We tried (without success) to book ourselves 
			somewhere to stay for tomorrow and had an early night.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 22nd September </span>
			We had breakfast at 9ish at a restaurant about 5 
			minutes walk away along the beach and spent an hour or so back at 
			the hotel before checking out at 11. We got a taxi back to the 
			airport and checked in for the 1:35 Lion Air flight to Labuan Bajo 
			(from where we get on our live-aboard on Sunday). The flight left 
			about 40 minutes late which was not too bad and we landed in Labuan 
			Bajo just before 4pm. We got another taxi into the centre of town 
			and were dropped off at the Gardena Hotel which was where we stayed 
			when we were here 12 years ago. Some of the rooms at the Gardena are 
			quite nice and most of the really basic ones have superb views. 
			Unfortunately, the only room they had was very basic and had no view 
			at all. We decided not to stay so I waited on the main road with all 
			our luggage while Roz went in search of a better option. After about 
			an hour she returned in a bemo having found a room further up the 
			hill from the town. I got into the bemo with the luggage and it took 
			us back up to "Seirama Villa Alam".</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LYNnd1EP69o/UF73rj752MI/AAAAAAAAGFs/dW14ZZIennU/s320/IMG_2994.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
The 
			room was still quite a long walk up the hill from the road but once 
			there, the view looking down at the harbour and across to Komodo was 
			excellent. The view we had from the Gardena 12 years ago was one of 
			the best we have ever had but this one probably beat it. Our "room" 
			room consisting of a small air conditioned bedroom and a large open 
			terrace/balcony with an open air kitchen and a bathroom&nbsp; We sat 
			on the terrace and watched the sunset before having showers. We then 
			had a couple of drinks on the balcony before walking back into town.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
			We had hoped to find somewhere showing the Swansea v Everton game 
			but the only place&nbsp; showing football was showing a game from 
			Scotland and they did not have the required channel. After we had 
			given up on that, we walked to another restaurant to eat before 
			returning to the balcony to follow the rest of the football with the 
			laptop and a very intermittent internet connection. We had a few 
			more drinks and got to bed just after 1am.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Njt8esMftEw/UGglfeQ3D-I/AAAAAAAAGGA/mo8wkIwMbN4/s320/IMG_3044.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 23rd September </span>
            Another day of not doing a lot. Breakfast was bought to 
			our balcony at 9 and apart from going into town for meals, we spent 
			the whole day lazing around on the balcony or sleeping. We walked into town at 
			1ish and ate at the Gardena's restaurant. This was the place where 
			12 years ago we had got drunk and were talked into learning to dive 
			by Steve and Lilian!
			
<p  class="diary-text">
			We went back into town in the evening and both had Italian meals at 
			The Lounge. By 9pm we were back on the balcony and had a slightly 
			earlier night than yesterday.</p>
