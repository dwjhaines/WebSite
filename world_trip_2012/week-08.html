<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 16th July</span> Yesterday, we had booked tickets for the 9:30 bus to 
			Tawau. There is nothing to see or do in Tawau but it is one of the 
			easiest places in the world to pick up Indonesian visas which we 
			need for later in the year. We left the hostel after breakfast and 
			left a lot of our luggage, together with all of our dive gear, 
			across the road with Scuba Junkie (we will be back here in a weeks 
			time). It was a 10 minute walk to the bus station and the bus left a 
			few minutes late just after 9:30. We got into Tawau at about 11:15 
			and walked to the MB Hotel which we had booked for two nights. We considered 
			going straight to the consulate but decided to have lunch first and 
			set off at about 12:30.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O8HTuLWrDy0/UAQRgrRL_MI/AAAAAAAAE34/TTwlvseZQ44/s320/IMG_0710.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We started walking to the consulate but when we had to stop and ask 
			directions, we found that it had moved from the location stated in 
			Lonely Planet and we had to get a taxi out to it. We got there just 
			before it reopened after lunch and found about 100 people sat around 
			waiting. When it did open, we were shown straight to the visa counter 
			and after filling out all the paperwork and paying about £35 each, 
			we were told that the visas would be issued today. We had expected 
			to have to come back tomorrow at the earliest so this was a bit of a 
			bonus. We sat/stood around waiting for just over an hour but by 3pm, 
			we had our passports back together with the visas. We got a bus back 
			into Tawau and were back at the hotel by 4.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			The downside to us getting the visas so quickly is that we have 
			booked two nights in Tawau and there really is nothing to do here. 
			Lonely Planet describes Tawau as Sabah's least memorable city and 
			our hotel is paid for until Wednesday! It is a very Muslim city so 
			there are no bars (although we are still on our week without alcohol 
			so this is probably a good thing) and there are no sights to see at 
			all. Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. The one good thing 
			about Tawau is that good hotels are very cheap so spent most of the 
			rest of the day in our room. Went out for another Indian meal at 
			7:30 but were back in the hotel an hour later.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lDyN67pzT3w/UAfscn7mnMI/AAAAAAAAE4E/Dc-sBOpRPuY/s320/IMG_0720.JPG"></a></b></font></div>

<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 17th July</span> Quite an enjoyable day spent doing very little. We left 
			the hotel to walk to the bus station after breakfast. We wanted to 
			buy tickets for tomorrow's bus to Sandakan but were told you could 
			not buy tickets in advance and should just turn up in the morning. 
			This was a bit disappointing as it was the only thing we had to do 
			today. We wandered round Tawau and posted some postcards before 
			returning to the hotel. We went out again for lunch before walking 
			to the highlight of Tawau - a mosque with a giant crab in front of 
			it! The roundabout with the giant crab also had a giant lobster and 
			a giant fish. Exciting stuff!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Spent most of the rest of the day reading in the room while catching 
			up with e-mails and sorting out underwater photos, etc. Like last 
			night, we went out to eat at 7:30 and were back in the room an hour 
			later.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 18th July</span> Left the hotel at 7:30 and walked to the bus station 
			where we got the 8:00 bus to Sandakan. The bus was old and not quite 
			as luxurious as some buses in Malaysia but was less than half full 
			so was reasonably comfortable. The journey took almost seven hours 
			which went pretty quickly. I read for the whole journey and finished 
			my book about 10 minutes before we arrived. The bus station is 2.5 
			miles outside Sandakan. We were quoted RM15 by a taxi driver which 
			seemed too much so got a minibus instead for RM1 each.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">The minibus dropped us in the centre and we had a five minute walk 
			to our hotel. We had booked two nights at the Sheraton. This hotel 
			only opened two months ago and is not yet finished.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6qxpcgt_4eE/UAi62Lc-6QI/AAAAAAAAE80/KITL4WZHQyc/s320/IMG_0747.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
There is still 
			building work going on and some parts of it - e.g. the gym, the gift 
			shop and the top six floors - are not 
			yet open. However, the pool is finished, some of the rooms are finished and 
			the views are superb. At £40 a night, it is probably the best value 
			place we will stay on the entire trip. It is certainly an 
			improvement on the place we stayed in last time we were here. It will be well outside our 
			budget when it is completed!
</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had time for about an hour by the pool before heading out to look 
			around the town. We had stayed here 12 years ago with Dave and 
			remember that everything shut at about 6pm. Things have changed a 
			bit since then but it is still not the most lively of places. We did 
			find a few Chinese restaurants by the waterfront that were quite 
			nice to sit and have a beer in (our alcohol free week is now over). 
			We had one drink before returning to the hotel for showers and then 
			went back to the same restaurant to 
			eat. We had a few more beers with our meal and in another place 
			closer to the hotel. We then returned to our room&nbsp; where we got 
			through a couple of bottles of local "apple rum".</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 19th July</span> Another day of not doing a lot. Had a very good 
			breakfast in the hotel (included in the price) and then spent a few 
			hours by the pool. Left the hotel briefly for lunch and again in the 
			evening to go to the same Chinese restaurant as last night. Had a 
			few beers again but gave the apple rum a miss tonight.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 20th July</span> We checked out of the hotel just before 11 after 
			explaining to the receptionist how to use the credit card machine! 
			We had booked a two day trip to a lodge on the Kinabatangan River 
			and the minibus from Barefoot Lodge was waiting for us by the time 
			we had got outside the hotel. We stopped in Sandakan to pick up a 
			Dutch family doing the same trip as us and then had a 2.5 hour 
			journey to Sukau. The lodge is fairly basic, not quite up to the 
			Sheraton standard, but has a really nice eating area overlooking the 
			river and will be fine for a couple of days. We had lunch and then 
			had a couple of hours to kill before our first river cruise at 4pm.
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Zv2TBJuCNO0/UAvJ0QJYuEI/AAAAAAAAE9Q/dfYt4zMu1jw/s320/IMG_0784.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">
The 
			reason to come to this area is to view the wildlife and the package 
			we have booked includes four river cruises at&nbsp; various 
			different times. The first cruise was excellent. We saw four 
			orang-utans which we were not really expecting to see. There were 
			two on their own and one mother and baby. This was more than some 
			people on our trip had seen when visiting Sepilok. We also saw a 
			family of about 20 proboscis monkeys that can only be seen in 
			Borneo.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			The highlight of the trip was twenty minutes viewing a herd of about 
			25 - 30 pygmy elephants. As the name suggests, these are slightly 
			smaller than other species of elephants but were still a fair size. 
			We had hoped to catch a glimpse of these animals and had been led to 
			believe that sightings were quite rare. However, we were able to 
			watch them eating at the side of the river from a couple of metres 
			away, not in the slightest bit bothered about us being there. We had 
			been unsure about how much we would enjoy doing this trip but this 
			experience on its own made it worth coming.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back at the lodge for tea at 7 but the planned night river 
			cruise get postponed until tomorrow due to the amount of debris 
			floating down the river following recent storms. Spent the rest of 
			the evening in the eating area and had an early night.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 21st July</span> Three more cruises today, the first before breakfast at 
			6am. This one was no-where near as good as the one yesterday. We did 
			see another orang-utan and more monkeys but not too much else apart 
			from a few birds. We did a 30 minute "jungle trek" during which we 
			saw two leaches and not a lot else. We had been advised that we 
			needed walking boots and leach resistant socks for this walk. Roz 
			borrowed a pair of shoes from another guest and I did it in sandals 
			and British Airways socks. We both seemed to survive!</p>

<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CUDvsQkyzTo/UAvJ0w1UxWI/AAAAAAAAE9U/hUPxOPF8-lE/s320/IMG_0840.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
After 
			breakfast, we had quite a bit of time to kill as the next cruise was 
			not until 4pm. We spent the time sat around in the dining area and 
			briefly lying in the sun. The second cruise was better. We saw 
			mainly monkeys - both proboscis monkeys and long tailed lemurs. 
			However, unlike yesterday, we were on a small tributary of the main 
			river so were much closer to them and were able to get some 
			reasonable pictures even with our cameras. We were back at the lodge 
			for tea and went for the night cruise just after 8. This was quite 
			good again. We saw a few owls and some other birds which were not 
			that spectacular but also saw a couple of tiny kingfishers. One of 
			them&nbsp; let us get to within about a metre of before it flew off.
</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back at the lodge by 9:30 by which time the restaurant area 
			was closed off so had showers and went to bed.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			All the cruises today were unlikely to match the experience with the 
			elephants yesterday but there has been enough to see to keep us 
			interested and it has been an enjoyable couple of days. We had been 
			unsure how long to stay here but the two nights and four cruises was 
			probably about right. What we have seen has been very good but there 
			is probably no reason to have stayed here any longer.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 22nd July</span> Up at 7:15 for breakfast and we were then transferred 
			by minibus, together with a Dutch couple to the main road between Sandakan and 
			Semporna (everyone at the lodge was 
			Dutch for some unknown reason). We had expected to be the only ones there but there were 
			about 15 - 20 people there by 9:00 all waiting for the bus to 
			Semporna. The bus arrived at 9:00 and was almost full already but the 
			four of us had places reserved so all got seats without any 
			problems. The journey was quicker than expected and we got back into 
			Semporna just before 1. We checked back in to the Scuba Junkie 
			backpackers to find there was a power cut so no fan or air-con.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch in a Chinese restaurant. All the Indian ones are closed 
			during the during daylight hours day at the moment as Ramadan started yesterday. We had a 
			few things to do in Semporna before we head to Mabul tomorrow for 10 
			days. We got more cash out so we could pay Scuba Junkie another load 
			of money. We will owe them a lot when we get back from Mabul and 
			giving them cash saves on the credit card fees. We retrieved our 
			dive bag so we could sort out our equipment and I also went out and 
			got my hair cut. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the day. The electric came back on at about 4:30. We 
			went back to our usual Indian restaurant for tea&nbsp; and walked to 
			the supermarket to stock up on diet coke for our stay in Mabul. We 
			were back in our room by 9.00.</p>
