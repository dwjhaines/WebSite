                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 13th May
                </span>We were up before 6 to do our early morning dive on the wreck again. We
                were in the water a few minutes earlier than yesterday and just caught sight of
                about 25 - 30 bump-heads as they were moving away for the day. When we were here
                in October, getting in the water before 6:30 meant that the bump-heads were
                still on the wreck. Now, there seem to be a lot more divers in the water by that
                time and they seem to moving away earlier. We did see the turtle on the wreck
                again and it was still a good dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                For my birthday, Roz had bought me a one day course with Jeff Mullins, a
                professional underwater photographer who lives just outside Tulamben. Jeff
                collected me from the dive centre at 8:30 and took me back to his house. The
                morning started with Jeff looking at the photos I have been taking and what
                settings I have been using and then spending some time going through what I
                could do to make improvements. This all took about three hours and I was back at
                TWD for lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch We went for a dive at a site that we have not dived before and spent
                an hour and a half or so taking pictures and trying out the new settings. Jeff's
                wife, Dawn, came along as well to act as the "spotter" and Roz also joined us on
                the dive. The dive was pretty good with plenty of stuff to see. Roz managed to
                see another turtle - Jeff and Dawn who have been diving here for years had never
                seen one at this site.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After the dive, we all went back to the dive centre and spent an hour or so in
                our room writing out the details of the settings on stickers to go on the camera
                housing. They stayed and chatted for a while and left at about 5ish. The whole
                day had been quite interesting and&nbsp; I now need to see whether or not my
                pictures will get any better!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for another dive as soon as Jeff and Dawn had left. It was our usual
                evening dive but it was already getting dark as we went in the water and was a
                night dive by the time we reached the wreck. There were plenty of bump-heads
                around towards the end of the dive as they all started getting back to the wreck
                for the night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate in a restaurant a few doors down from where we are staying and were back
                in the room before 9:00. I was asleep within about 10 minutes of getting back.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 14th May
                </span>Back to our usual routine of two morning dives and one evening dive
                today. We did the first dive on the wreck at 6:20. This was an enjoyable dive
                without seeing anything too notable until about the 75th minute when Roz spotted
                two harlequin shrimps. They were in about 2m of water by the entry/exit point
                and she spotted them just as we were about to surface and get out.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2hTjCz1UXws/UZcPqpfIZEI/AAAAAAAAMRU/e4GGxvffyCc/s320/IMG_2085.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                For the second dive, we went back to Coral Garden. At this site, someone has
                placed a temple type thing in the sand surrounded by bells and other temple
                related statues, etc. It all looked quite interesting when we dived here a
                couple of days ago but we got side-tracked by turtles before we had a chance to
                look around. We were able to spend some time looking around this today. It was
                certainly different to anything we have seen underwater before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The third dive back at the Liberty was very good again. It was really good
                conditions on the wreck tonight with very little current. We were on the black
                sand for about 50 minutes and then had half an hour on the wreck, 15 minutes of
                which were spent with the hawksbill turtle that we have see round here a few
                times in the last couple of days.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to have a day of diving tomorrow so had a few drinks in the
                evening. We had a couple while doing logbooks and looking at photos before going
                out to eat in the same place as last night. When we got back to the room we got
                through a couple of bottles of rum on the balcony and do not remember going to
                bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th May
                </span>Spent the morning recovering from last night and catching up on sleep. By
                lunchtime, the weather had deteriorated and it was raining heavily again. It was
                been pretty poor since Sunday night and has rained every day since then.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">Although we had not planned to dive today, we did not have
                a lot else to do, so just before 4:00 we did another 90 minute dive at the
                wreck. It was a similar dive to last nights but without the turtle this time.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Despite the amount of sleep we had last night, we were worn out again after the
                dive. We ate at The Safety Stop and were in bed before 9:00.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th May
                </span>Another good days diving. On the first dive, we saw the bump-heads back
                on the wreck again. There was a group of about 20 - 30 that appeared to be
                leaving the wreck as we got to it but they turned round and stayed. There were
                others there as well making 40 - 50 in total. They stayed around the rear of the
                wreck with us for about 30 minutes before moving off. There were hardly any
                other divers around so this was an excellent start to the days diving. We
                continued round the wreck and saw two turtles during the remainder of the dive.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                For the second dive, we planned to dive Coral Garden. There was a strong current
                as soon as we got in. We battled against it for about 10 minutes before giving
                up and drifting with it. Eventually, we got back to the wreck and ended our dive
                there. By 4pm, the current had gone and we were able to do our usual late
                evening dive without any problems. Saw all the usual stuff and had another five
                minutes with a turtle on the wreck.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate at Warung Komang, the place just down the road from the dive centre and
                had another early night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 17th May
                </span>A very similar day to yesterday. We had another 30 minutes with the
                bump-heads on the wreck. There were not as many as yesterday and when we got
                there, there were as many divers as there were bump-heads. However, as with
                yesterday, they stayed on the wreck and once the other divers had moved on, we
                had them to ourselves for about 15 minutes. Just the one turtle this morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                For the second dive, we went to The Drop-Off. When we were here last year we
                were diving here every other day. This year, we have been enjoying Coral Garden
                so had not made it here yet. It was a nice enough and we did see three of the
                bump-heads again, but there did not seem to be as much here as when we were here
                before and we will probably stick with Coral Garden for our last two days.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The evening dive was very good again (despite me having one of the heavy tanks)
                with another 15 minutes with the turtle at the end. We had a couple of beers
                while we did our log books before going out to The Safety Stop to eat. We had
                another drink on the balcony when we got back but were still asleep before
                10:00.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 18th May
                </span>Another very similar day apart from the fact that we dived Coral Garden
                instead of Drop-Off. We had plenty of time with the bump-heads again on the
                first dive despite there being a lot of other divers around when we went in.
                Coral Garden was very good again - loads of fish and about seven ribbon eels.
                The evening dive was almost a repeat of last nights with another 15 - 20 minutes
                with "Wreck Turtle". The evening was also very similar to yesterday with a few
                beers and a meal at The Safety Stop.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ztVbKCNdPWs/UZ8lQslFtnI/AAAAAAAAMSM/uz0uY55Hkyk/s320/IMG_0966.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 19th May
                </span>Today was our last day of diving in Tulamben. We were at the wreck before
                6:30 as usual. We had decided not to spend so long with the bump-heads today and
                go deeper to see more of the wreck. However, once the other divers had moved on,
                we were left on our own with a group of about 20 of them and did not want to
                leave. We ended up staying for about 30 minutes again and were probably closer
                to them than we have been before. The rest of the dive was OK although the vis
                was not great and Wreck Turtle was nowhere to be seen.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Second dive was at Coral Garden again. This was a nice enough dive apart from
                some strange down currents after about 15 minutes. They did not last long
                however, and the rest of the dive was enjoyable with plenty of fish.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Our final dive was our usual evening dive. We did not spend so long on the slope
                tonight, we thought we would spend more time on the wreck with the turtle. The
                vis was terrible when we got to the wreck and although we did manage to find the
                turtle, we lost her after a few minutes when she went up for air and could not
                find her again</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the dive centre, we washed our gear and hung it up to dry. We paid our
                bill for the last nine days' accommodation and diving and by 8:00 were on our
                balcony with drinks. We had a couple before going out to eat at The Safety Stop
                again. The last fixtures of the Premier League started at 11:00 and they were
                happy to put it on the tele. Neither Swansea or Sunderland were on either of the
                channels showing football but we stayed in there watching Newcastle v Arsenal
                and following all the other games on the laptop. We left there at 1am and
                returned to finish a bottle of rum on the balcony again. Got to bed sometime
                around 2:00.</p>
