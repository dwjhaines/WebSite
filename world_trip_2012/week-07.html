<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 9th July</span> After a few days at home, we left for Heathrow at 
			about 4:30 for the start of the second leg of our trip. We got to 
			Heathrow without any problems and were checked in for our flight to 
			Singapore by about 6:30. Because of British Airways' recent takeover 
			of BMI, our BMI silver cards have been transferred to BA meaning 
			that for one year, we have BA silver status. This is something that 
			we would never be able to get normally and is already proving to be 
			a big bonus. We were upgraded to "economy plus" for this flight and 
			also had two hours in the BA lounge before the flight. We are not 
			usually big fans of airport lounges but this one was very good and a 
			big improvement on having to sit in the main part of terminal 3. 
			After a few drinks in the lounge, we boarded the plane which left on 
			time at 9:15.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We would not usually pay the extra for economy plus but the extra 
			leg-room and bigger seats meant we had a very enjoyable flight. We 
			had quite a few more drinks before falling asleep and managed to 
			sleep well for about 5 or 6 hours.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 10th July</span> Arrived at Changi airport just after 5pm. We were 
			through the airport quite quickly and after taking out money, we got 
			the MRT train to City Hall. It was a 5 minute walk from here to the 
			Carlton Hotel where we had booked a room for two nights. After 
			showers, we went out to eat. We walked to the area we had eaten in 
			the last time we were in Singapore. The food centre that we had been 
			to before had been replaced by a new shopping mall but we found 
			another one slightly further away that served Indian food and beer 
			which is what we were looking for. After our first roti canai of the 
			trip and a few beers we walked back to the hotel. In our room, we 
			started to work out how much we had drunk over the last six weeks 
			and came to the conclusion that we needed a week or so without any 
			alcohol. We reached this conclusion while consuming most of one of 
			the litre bottles of Bacardi we had bought from duty free!</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 11th July</span> We did not do a lot today. We got up at about 11 and 
			went out for breakfast before returning to the hotel. There was 
			nothing that we really wanted to see or do in Singapore so spent 
			most of the rest of the day lazing around the hotel and using the 
			internet to make some bookings for later in the trip. We did go out 
			for a walk around the area near the hotel. It is quite well located, 
			just across the road from the Raffles Hotel and near the Padang. We 
			walked over to Little India in the evening&nbsp; for tea.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_wi_3NORI8Q/UAOQuyd6XqI/AAAAAAAAE3Q/J-tUeuzYipM/s320/IMG_0471.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 12th July</span> We went out for breakfast at 8 and checked out of the 
			hotel just after 9. We got the MRT back out to the airport and 
			checked in for the first of our two Air Asia flights - the 11:40 to 
			Kuala Lumpa. This flight was on time and we arrived in KL an hour 
			after we took off. We collected our luggage at KL, cleared 
			immigration, and then queued to check in for the 3:40 flight to 
			Tawau. When we had done all this we had a couple of hours to kill so 
			had lunch (McDonalds) and then walked around getting information 
			about buses for when we get back here in three weeks time.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The second flight was also on time and uneventful. We arrived in 
			Tawau just after 6:30 and cleared Sabah immigration. We were met 
			outside the airport by the taxi from Scuba Junkie and were in 
			Semporna by 8:30. We checked into a room at the Scuba Junkie Lodge, 
			dropped off our luggage and went out to eat in one of the nearby 
			Indian restaurants. We went back to the room for showers after 
			eating and also to prepare our diving equipment for tomorrow when we 
			will do our first dives of the trip.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 13th July</span> After a quick breakfast, we went across the road to 
			Scuba Junkie at 7:15 and completed the required paperwork. We had 
			booked a few days diving at the sites around Semporna as we had not 
			visited these before. Today we were booked on a three dive trip to 
			Mataking. We left Semporna at about 8:30 and had a one hour boat 
			trip to Mataking. There were about 12 customers on the boat 
			including four snorkelers as well as three dive staff. We were put 
			in a group with three others, all from England and were guided by 
			Edgar. </p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_ygaU9XTUXE/UAORIN6t2HI/AAAAAAAAE3c/KjG14R8byjY/s320/IMG_0473.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">The 
			first dive was at a small wreck and was a lot better than expected. 
			We saw our first turtle after four minutes and saw 13 in total on 
			this dive. We were not expecting that many in this area. The second 
			dive was not so good - a similar site to the Kepali House reef but 
			with no-where near as much to see. The third was very good again 
			with another 8 turtles and four frog fish. All in all, a very good 
			days diving to begin the trip with.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in Semporna by 5:30 and after showers, we spent an hour 
			or so trying to sort out our Santander bank accounts which Santander 
			appear to have blocked for some reason. Roz was able to unblock hers 
			but I could not unblock mine as I apparently could not answer my 
			security questions correctly! We ate at our usual restaurant and 
			went back to the hotel to do log books etc before a relatively early 
			night.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 14th July</span> Another day of diving from Semporna, this time to Mantabuan, another island to the North of Semporna. Today, apart from the 
			guide Nas, we were the only divers on the boat although there were 
			three snorkelers and Shane, their guide. (One of the snorkelers was 
			a German who had been at the England v Italy game in Kiev three 
			weeks ago!) The dive sites were similar 
			to yesterdays but not as good. It was not bad diving, just not quite 
			as good as Mataking. We still saw another frog fish and six turtles 
			as well as plenty of other stuff and it was another enjoyable day.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ngY0CxxP8P8/UAORHvGWbaI/AAAAAAAAE3Y/UDwBijABpQE/s320/IMG_0602.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">
The best dive of the day was when we returned to Semporna and we did 
			the night dive in the harbour. We returned to the dive shop at 6:00 
			and left about 15 minutes later, getting into the water at 6:45. We 
			were the only two customers doing this dive with Jake (or Jack?) but 
			the owner of the dive shop was also diving. We had been told about 
			this dive last year but had been unable to fit it in. It was one of 
			the best night dives we have ever done. I am not normally a big fan 
			of night dives but there was loads to see here in amongst all the 
			rubbish in the harbour. We saw three sea-horses and an electric clam 
			which we have never seen before. There were a few cuttle fish of 
			various types and sizes, octopus, crabs, a Spanish dancer, etc. Our 
			longest dive of the day at 77 minutes and it went remarkably 
			quickly.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in Semporna by 8:30 and, after washing the gear and 
			having showers, we ate in our usual restaurant and were back in the 
			hotel by 10:00.</p>
			

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1FjLXNLeu4/UAvJsBdXPmI/AAAAAAAAE9I/iHbYE1jpTws/s320/IMG_0688.JPG"></div>
<p align="justify">
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 15th July</span> Our third and final days diving from Semporna. This time, we went to Sibuan, about 30 minutes away from Semporna by 
			boat. Three more dives with Nas and Ted, a former Scuba Junkie DMT. 
			It was the same boat as we were on two days ago but with less people 
			- four other customers - so we had plenty of space. The dives were 
			very good again - with plenty of turtles. Roz counted 12 making a 
			total of 40 for our three days of diving. Also plenty of frog-fish 
			again as well as a devil ray which is quite rare to see here.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in Semporna relatively early today by about 4:30. We 
			washed our gear and had showers before settling our bill at the dive 
			centre. We walked to a different cash-point machine and found that 
			we could both get money out which was a surprise but good news. Did 
			not do a lot for the rest of the day apart from another Indian meal 
			and had another early night.</p>
