    <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday, 30th July</span> Another three local dives. We were supposed to be 
			going back to Siamil today but the boat we were supposed to be on 
			had engine problems delaying departure and the sea was rough 
			following storms the last two nights. I not sure which of these 
			contributed the most to the trip being cancelled but it meant 
			another day of diving around Mabul/Kapali.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tZSysG9KxOE/UBplzVB7oCI/AAAAAAAAFCM/ts6PUqh3-aQ/s320/IMG_1384.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
Our 
			diving team from the last few days has completely broken up - Brett 
			and Heather have left and Dave was guiding at Sipadan today. We were 
			guided instead by Ella (an instructor from Stockport) and were also 
			with Katherine who we have been on the boat with a few times in the 
			last week. The first dive was Kapali House Reef again. This is a 
			site we have dived a few times and is always quite enjoyable 
			although there does not seem to be as much to see as last year.
</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The 
			second site was Cleaning Station, a site we 
			have not dived before just a bit further along from House Reef. 
			Towards the start of the dive, there was an area where once again, 
			there seemed to be turtles everywhere. Like yesterday, they were 
			mainly big sea turtles and were not in the slightest bit bothered 
			about having divers very close to them.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The third dive after lunch 
			(with Kimberley replacing Katherine in our group) was back at Mabul 
			and another site we have not dived before - Nudi Nook. As the name 
			suggests, this site had loads of nudibranchs - something that we 
			have not seen so many of on this trip.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had been considering trying to do a fourth dive on some of the 
			days we were diving locally. However, doing at least three or four 
			dives a day for the last eight days has been quite tiring and we 
			decided against doing an extra dive this evening. Getting back by 
			4:30 and having an hour or so on the beach has been quite enjoyable 
			and we have plenty more diving to come in the next few months. 
			Although not quite as tired as yesterday, we had another relatively 
			early night. We did go to the bar for a beer before tea and stayed 
			in the restaurant for an hour or so after eating but were still back 
			in the room by 9ish.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mNbIj_eIELY/UByF31rS6nI/AAAAAAAAFNE/ubfA5lHB5nA/s320/IMG_1426.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 31st July</span> Our fourth and final trip to Sipadan. The guides on the 
			boat were Apek and Khai. There were only three other divers on the 
			boat - Philipe and Sybille from Switzerland and Begum&nbsp; from 
			Turkey. The other couple on the boat were snorkelling so the seven 
			of us dived in one group. The last three nights, there have been 
			severe storms and heavy rain in the area. They have only lasted a 
			couple of hours each night but they have had a dramatic negative 
			effect on the visibility. As soon as we jumped in for the first 
			dive, it was obvious that the diving was not going to be as 
			spectacular as on our first three trips here.
</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It was however, still a very good days diving. We dived Barracuda 
			Point, South Point, Coral Garden and Barracuda again. The dives at 
			Barracuda were the best ones again particularly when we found the 
			school of chevron barracuda on the last dive. Roz counted more 
			turtles than on any other day we have been here - 46 including 3 
			that were spotted form the surface. </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Before tea, we went for a couple of beers at the Borneo Divers bar 
			on the beach. After eating, we went upstairs to the Scuba Junkie bar 
			and joined everyone else from today's trip for log book signing etc. 
			After an hour or so in there, we returned to our balcony to finish 
			the duty free Bacardi.</p>
			
<<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-25qTnLffaEw/UByHKYeJ1FI/AAAAAAAAFNU/_GU5Lp8nCXU/s320/IMG_1464.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 1st August</span> Another day of local dives. We were back diving with 
			Debi again and had Peter with us for the first two dives. We are 
			limited at the moment in which sites we can dive. Although the 
			weather is good, it is still windy and one side of the island can 
			not be dived due to the big waves. We went back to Kapali for the 
			first dive and chose to dive at Cleaning Station again. There was 
			plenty of turtle activity in the same place as last time and we 
			spent about 15 minutes here before moving on. The second dive was 
			back at the Sea Venture Oil Rig and like last week, this was done in 
			strong current. Not the best of sites in these conditions! The third 
			(on our own with Debi by this time) was a 70 minute dive at Awas 
			again. The seahorse had moved on and there was not too much to see 
			in the sandy part of the dive but there were a couple more turtles 
			at the end and it was still reasonably enjoyable.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Got back to our room to find a 1 metre long monitor lizard in our 
			bathroom. Five or six members of staff appeared at our room to stand 
			around thinking about how to remove it before Debi walked in and 
			chased it out!</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			Again, we were worn out from the diving so had an early night.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd August</span> Our final day of diving from Mabul. It was a late start 
			this morning (9:45 on the jetty) so we had time to pack and check 
			out of our room before the first dive of the day. Choice of dive 
			sites was still limited by the weather so it was similar diving to 
			yesterday. Today, we were led by Ryan and were joined by Montserrat 
			and John, a loud and annoying American. We were relieved that his 
			first day here coincided with our last as we would not want to have 
			spent too much time on the boat with him!</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			First dive was Kapali House Reef which we were not that 
			pleased about but it turned into quite a good dive. We did not see 
			too much of any interest but did see three turtles which we were not 
			expecting here. Second dive was at Nudi Nook which we enjoyed again 
			and saw another four turtles. The third dive of the day (and our 
			last here) started at Froggies and covered four dive sites due to 
			the strong currents. We went all the way past Paradise I &amp; II and 
			were eventually picked up on Panglima. Enjoyable enough dive despite 
			the current and the worst vis so far. We saw another five turtles 
			bring the total to 251 in the 14 days we have done with Scuba 
			Junkie.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GEaP0blcoEQ/UByGTYPL5vI/AAAAAAAAFNM/XTpFcAApNtQ/s320/IMG_1531.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">
We were back at the jetty by 4:30 and left Mabul before 5. It was 
			sad to be leaving despite the fact that we are continuing to travel. 
			It is still the best place we have dived and has been a superb place 
			to stay again. Yesterday, Carys (one of the managers) had said we 
			should stay and work as dive masters for Scuba Junkie. We were not 
			sure how serious she was but they are short of staff at the moment. 
			It may be something to think about next year. Either way, I think we 
			will be back here before the end of our trip.
</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in Semporna before 6 and hung up all our dive gear to 
			dry in the gear room. I managed to get my regs fixed by Tino, the 
			owner of Scuba Junkie. They had started leaking after two days of 
			diving from Mabul and I had to use shop regs for the rest of the 
			time there. They could not be repaired on Mabul but Tino managed to 
			sort them out in about 15 minutes which was good news.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We walked to the SeaFest Hotel where we had booked a room for 
			the night. We had a few beers in the room before going out to eat in 
			our usual Indian restaurant. We had hoped to meet up with Peter 
			again but he was not in the bar so we returned to the room after 
			eating and had a few more drinks before getting to bed at about 
			1:30.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd August</span> Got up at about 9:00 and had breakfast at the hotel. We 
			had managed to get a late checkout from the hotel so kept the room 
			until 2pm. We had stayed here as there is a pool and we do not get 
			our transfer to the airport until 4pm. After we had checked out at 
			2:00, we left our bags at the dive shop and went to get money out. 
			My card is blocked by Santander again so had to have another 10 
			minute phone call to them to try and sort it out.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to the dive shop, paid our bill, collected all our gear 
			and re-packed our luggage. It was gone 3:00 by this time. We had 
			roti canai for lunch before getting picked up from the shop at 4:00 
			along with three others from Mabul who are on the same flight as us.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It took just over an hour to the airport in Tawau and after checking 
			in, we had about an hour to wait before boarding the Air Asia flight 
			to Kuala Lumpa. The flight took off on time at 7:00pm and landed 15 
			minutes early at 9:30. We bought bus tickets for a 7:30 bus tomorrow 
			morning while waiting for our luggage and then started walking out 
			towards the Tune Hotel about 5 minutes walk away. We stopped at the 
			food court to get something to eat on the way and were checked into 
			our room just after 10:30. The Tune Hotel is a budget hotel chain -&nbsp; 
			there is only just enough room for our luggage to fit on the floor 
			beside the bed. It is not the sort of place you would want to stay 
			for any length of time but as we are only in KL for less than 10 
			hours, it is ideal.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 4th August</span> Got up before 7 and checked out of the hotel. We walked 
			back to LCCT where I managed to take out money and we also 
			bought breakfast to eat on the bus. We were travelling to Mersing so 
			that we can get a ferry to Palau Tioman (Tioman Island) tomorrow 
			morning. There are no direct buses from the airport so we had the 
			choice of getting a bus into the centre of KL or going to Malacca 
			and changing there. We chose the second option. Although slightly 
			longer, the first option would of involved getting across KL which 
			would not of been that easy with all our luggage. In Malacca, 
			everything goes in and out of the same bus station.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			Our bus left on time at 7:30 and got into Malacca at 9:30. We had no 
			problems getting tickets for the 12:45 bus to Mersing so had three 
			hours to kill at the bus station. We spent nearly all the time in 
			McDonalds as it was air-conditioned, had free wi-fi and was just 
			round the corner from the bus ticket office. The bus left slightly 
			late but made up the time and got into Mersing at 5:15.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			It was only a few minutes walk from the bus station to The Emperor 
			Hotel, a fairly basic Chinese hotel in the centre of Mersing. Once 
			again, it is fine for a night and at RM55 is pretty good value. We 
			left our luggage in the room and went for a walk around the town. 
			Not too much to see and do again. We bought ferry tickets for 
			tomorrow and returned to the bus station to buy tickets for the bus 
			back to Singapore in eight days time. I also got my hair cut. We 
			returned to the room for showers before going out to eat at an 
			Indian restaurant. We were back in the hotel by 9, luckily just in 
			time to watch the tennis from the olympics.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 5th August</span> We were up by 7 and went out for roti canai for 
			breakfast. We left the hotel just after 8 and walked down to the 
			jetty for the boat to Tioman. The original time for the ferry had 
			been 8:30. We knew that the time had changed to 9:30 but wanted to 
			get there early just in case. As it was, we needn't have bothered as 
			the boat was late getting in and did not leave until about 10:15. 
			The journey over to Tioman was uneventful and we were dropped off at 
			ABC Beach at about 12:30. We walked to Bamboo Hill Chalets dropping 
			off our dive gear at B&amp;J Dive Centre on the way.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Nn-OUScGc-A/UCe7pcwIqsI/AAAAAAAAFT4/mzYt_W8gHFA/s320/IMG_1563.JPG"></a></div>
<p class="diary-text">
We 
			had booked one week at Bamboo Hill. The room is basic but we had 
			chosen it as it is on the side of a hill at the end of the beach and 
			has superb views.&nbsp; Tioman seems a pretty nice place. It is 
			quieter and less developed than we were expecting but there are 
			plenty of shops and restaurants and it is a duty free island so the 
			alcohol is cheap!
</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch in a restaurant by the beach and then I walked to and 
			from Tekek, the main village on the island while Roz lay on the 
			beach. I bumped into Regan and Annette in Tekek as they had just 
			arrived from Singapore (Tekek is not a large place and the airport 
			is in the centre of the village). </p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We met up with Regan and Annette at 6 and started on their duty free 
			Bacardi while sat on their balcony. The restaurants here let you 
			take your own alcohol in as long as you are buying soft drinks so we 
			carried on drinking during tea. We stopped for a couple of beers in 
			the B&amp;J bar before returning to the balcony for a few more drinks. I 
			vaguely remember walking home but have no idea at what time!</p>
