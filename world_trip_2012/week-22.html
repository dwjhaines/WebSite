                When we decided on Ubud, we had also booked five nights in Amed. We had looked
                at a couple of places but eventually decided to go back to Jemeluk Beach. We had
                booked a room at Jukung Bali, the same place we had stayed before. We really
                liked it there in 2007 and it is close to Eco Dive, a dive centre that we were
                also very impressed with. We also booked a transfer through Jukung Bali and they
                picked us up from Ubud just before 11.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey took about two hours so we were in our room by 1:00. The "resort"
                only has four rooms. We were not able to book the one we had last time but were
                in the slightly smaller one next to it. It is just as nice, and right on the
                beach, just slightly smaller. We went and got lunch from the warang we have
                eaten at a few times before and then walked to Eco Dive to sort out our diving
                for the next few days. When we were here five years ago, they gave us big
                discounts as we were dive-masters and also let us dive unguided. We were not
                able to get exact price details as the owner was not there but they seemed happy
                to let us dive on our own again and told us to come back tomorrow at 9:00.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours back at the room and went out for a walk again at
                about 4:30. We had been told of a ceremony that was taking place on the beach
                but could not see anything going on so walked up a hill to see the sun setting
                behind Mt Agung.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We briefly met John, the owner of Eco Dive but did not
                really get any closer to finding out the cost of diving. We know it will be
                relatively cheap - just do not know the exact price for anything!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate out at "Diver's cafe" and were back in the room by about 9:00.</p>

                After four days off, it was back to diving today. The local diving is done from
                the small Indonesian fishing boats, known as "jukungs". We set up our gear in
                the dive centre and it was carried down to the beach by the local porters
                (similar porter system to Tulamben).</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5xutmtFt5dI/UIfwGN2aNDI/AAAAAAAAHUI/y-46167mIfw/s320/IMG_4782.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a boat journey of about 15 minutes to the first site "Bunutan". This was
                a drift dive i.e. the boat dropped us in the water, we drifted with the current
                for 70 minutes and the boat was there to pick us up where we surfaced (despite
                the SMB bursting!). The dive was pretty good and we were back to diving in warm
                water again which was a relief. There was a spectacular area of garden eels at
                the start of the dive before the current picked up and plenty to see along the
                way.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to the dive centre to change tanks before going back out on the
                boat for the second dive. This was at "Pyramids". It was another drift dive
                through a load of structures that have been placed in the water to create
                artificial reefs. The currents had died quite a bit by the time we did this dive
                so we could go a bit more slowly . Roz nearly lost a fin getting back into the
                boat and I had to put my gear back on and go down to 5m to retrieve it. Despite
                this, it was another enjoyable dive and we ended up surfacing immediately in
                front of our bungalow. We will happily repeat both of these dives before we
                leave here. We rinsed our gear and had lunch at the dive centre before returning
                to the Jukung Bali for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we ate at a restaurant about 5 minutes walk from where we are
                staying and had one of the best, and cheapest, meals we have had in Indonesia.
                We will definitely by eating there again.</p>

                Today's dives were both at "Cafe Garam" which is the house reef of the other
                place we had looked into staying at. We walked to Eco Dive by 8:00 and were
                driven about three miles down the road to the village of Amed. We were dropped
                by the dive centre with all our gear and four tanks and were told to phone when
                we wanted to be picked up again. After a quick look at the beach, we set up our
                stuff and walked into the water.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5K5O_hgmDM0/UIkHwGDAIkI/AAAAAAAAHUc/9Wx46gySvw4/s320/IMG_4864.JPG">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had not dived this site before but it was a fairly simple site to navigate.
                There is very little coral here but a lot of metal structures have been placed
                on the black sandy slope creating a series of artificial reefs. They do not
                cover a huge area so it was easy enough to cover the whole site in a single
                dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did two dives, both of which were quite similar and
                both of which were over 80 minutes. There was a lot to see living in the
                structures. We found five ghost pipe fish on the first dive and another two on
                the second. We saw at least four juvenile angel fish, four stone fish all in the
                same structure, and loads of shrimps in a cleaning station made up of a pile of
                tyres. All round the site, there seemed to stingrays darting around as well as
                plenty of butterfly fish and red tooth trigger fish. Both dives were very
                enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by Eco Dive a few minutes after we called them and were back
                at the dive centre before 1:00. We walked back to our room stopping off at
                GaneshAmed (where we ate last night) for lunch. Another afternoon of not doing
                much. We ate out again at GaneshAmed in the evening and were back in our
                bungalow by 8:30.</p>

                Today we did a repeat of the two dives we did on Tuesday... this time, both
                dives were better. We had been talking to John before we went out and he advised
                us to go deeper at the start of Bunutan instead of following the obvious route
                round the corner of the bay. This turned out to be good advice. Turning the
                corner at 30m instead of 20m made a huge difference. There was a lot more fish
                there and we saw a white-tip reef shark swimming around. Towards the end of the
                dive, we saw a big school of jack fish that we spent about five minutes with. We
                started the second dive slightly further South than on Tuesday so ended further
                South as well. This meant that there was more to see as well as the pyramids and
                we also had the two closest encounters with turtles we have had since getting to
                Bali.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The rest of the day was spent in much the same way as yesterday.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QxS3_NFECHI/UIqRnlpLWGI/AAAAAAAAHVA/s5k5avzxSMk/s320/IMG_4958.JPG">

                An almost identical day to yesterday! We did the same two dives again and they
                were just as good as yesterday. The shark and the jacks were in the same places
                at Bunutan. At Pyramids, we only saw one turtle - it was the second turtle that
                we saw yesterday. Yesterday we only saw it briefly but today we spent 15 minutes
                watching it eat and swimming up to the surface. This was right at the end of the
                dive and was a perfect ending to four very good days of diving here.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the dive centre, we paid our bill. They had been very vague about the
                prices but the bill came to less than we were expecting - Rp1,730,00 (just over
                £115) for eight dives each. This included a replacement mouth piece for Roz's
                regs and a t-shirt to replace the one I bought here five years ago.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The diving here was not quite as cheap as at Tulamben but considering that each
                day we either needed a boat or a car journey, it was just as good value. We were
                really impressed with Eco Dive when we came here five years ago and they have
                been just as good again. The diving has been excellent and we are already
                wandering if we can come back here sometime later in the trip - probably
                sometime next May.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The rest of the day was similar to all the other ones here. We returned to Eco
                Dive in the evening to collect the rest of our gear and say our goodbyes. We
                also booked a transfer back to Tulamben for 9:00 tomorrow. We ate at GaneshAmed
                for a final time and were back in our room by 8:30.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 27th October
                </span>
                We checked out of our room just before 9:00 and were back in Tulamben by 9:30.
                We were able to check into our room behind the dive centre straight away.
                Although the room in Amed was very nice, it was good to be back in
                air-conditioning again.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After unpacking, we went off for our first dive of the day. We had decided to
                dive the wreck again even though we knew it would be busy at this time. There
                were a lot of other divers around but it is a big enough dive site for this not
                to matter too much. We had planned to do two dives today but managed to get a
                third one in. We dived at Coral Garden for the second at 2ish and back at the
                Liberty for the third as it was getting dark. All three dives were very good
                again. We had borrowed proper booties from the dive centre which made getting in
                and out of the water a lot easier - ours are designed for diving from boats, not
                beaches. We really should of done this last time we were here!</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going out to eat. We ate at
                Safety Stop while watching the first of the afternoons football matches. We had
                planned to return to our balcony to follow the rest of the afternoon's football
                but the Wi-Fi at the resort was not working.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We decided to go for a drink at the TWD restaurant, about
                20m down the road instead. This was closed when we got there but the "security
                guards" let us watch the television and drink our own rum which did not work out
                too badly. We stayed in there for the second game and also the Man. City v
                Swansea game which kicked off at half past midnight. I don't remember too much
                about the latter stages of this game but it was getting on for 3am by the time
                we got back to our room.</p>

                Did not do a lot all day. We were not particularly hung-over but were both tired
                after five days of diving and a late night.</p>
