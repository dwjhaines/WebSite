            We had a few more hours on our balcony before being 
			picked up by the crew from Black Manta at about 11:00. We were 
			driven down to the harbour and taken by zodiac out to where Black 
			Manta was moored. Most of the other guests were already on board. We 
			were shown to our cabin and spent 30 minutes or so unpacking and 
			setting up our gear.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lpqsmC_sn24/UGgpUSWq24I/AAAAAAAAGGQ/ulnGg0Q1OkA/s320/IMG_3162.JPG"></div>
<p align="justify">
            The boat itself is excellent. We have an en-suite cabin with 
			probably as much space as we have had on any live-aboard. The dive 
			deck is huge for the amount of divers on the boat and there is loads 
			of space for sitting around in the dining area and sundeck as well 
			as a large air-conditioned lounge. We had lunch at 12:30 before a 
			long briefing and the first dive at 2pm.
</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			There are about 17 divers on the boat. We were put into a group with 
			Brad (from America) and Jurg (from Switzerland). The group was led 
			by Stanny, an Indonesian guide. The first dive was the check dive at 
			the first dive site we came to out of Labuan Bajo. This was not that 
			good a site and the vis was pretty poor but still enjoyable enough. 
			The second dive at 5:15 was better. This was a sunset dive so it was 
			just about dark by the time we got back out of the water. This site 
			was right on the edge of the Komodo National Marine Park where we 
			will do all the rest of our dives on this trip. It was much better 
			than the first one with quite a lot to see (frog fish, ghost pipe 
			fish, nudi's, a Spanish dancer and a group of bump-head parrot 
			fish).</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			Back on the boat, dinner was served at 7:30. After an hour or so of 
			sitting around in the dining area, everyone had gone to bed by about 
			9:45 while the boat continued moving to the Southern Komodo dive 
			sites. So far the trip seems pretty good. The food 
			is excellent and Cedric, the tour leader, seems to have everything 
			pretty well organised. The level of service on the boat is certainly 
			higher than anything we have had before in Asia and is more 
			comparable to the luxury boats in the Red Sea. Our towels get dried 
			for us between each dive and there was hot chocolate handed to us at 
			the end of the last dive!</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-copuFush1hE/UGgpc4eh6xI/AAAAAAAAGGY/p-kk4UCkISs/s320/IMG_3127.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th September </span>
            First dive of the day was Torpedo Alley, just off Rinca, 
			at 7:30. We had been told that the water would be colder on the 
			Southern Komodo sites so we borrowed full length wet-suits for 
			today's dives. As soon as we hit the water, we realised that this 
			was a very good move!
</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			The water temperature was about 24º which, although only a few degrees cooler than what we are used to, 
			feels a lot, lot colder. Once we were used to the temperature, the 
			dive was excellent. This was proper muck diving again - a black 
			sandy slope covered in strange fish. The highlight was probably a 
			tiny white frog fish but we also saw a juvenile flamboyant cuttle 
			fish, two robust ghost pipe fish, some huge nudi's that we have not 
			seen before, a fingered dragonet and spent about five minutes 
			watching a mimic octopus.</span></font></p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wyBF8ps9644/UGgqBy6mhKI/AAAAAAAAGGk/j0fB0am_1Yk/s320/IMG_3147.JPG"></a></font></div>
<p align="justify">
            It was back to the boat for breakfast 
			and we then went up to the beach to look at five Komodo Dragons. 
			These huge lizards only exist in this part of the world and we will 
			be doing a walk to see more of them later in this trip. However, we 
			had not expected to be able to see them like this. We were taken by 
			the zodiacs up to where we could see a group of dragons on the 
			beach. 
			Although they are very dangerous, they will not go into cold 
			water, so we could stand in the sea a few metres away from them 
			knowing that they could not get to us.
</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			The second dive of the day at Cannibal 
			Rock was not as good as the first but we did see three turtles. The 
			third dive at Pink Beach was particularly poor. It was still cold 
			and the vis had dropped to five metres or less. After 48 minutes we 
			aborted the dive. It was not worth staying any longer.</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			The fourth 
			dive of the day was a night dive and was very good. Loads to see - 
			mainly similar sort of stuff to what we saw on the first dive of the 
			day. All in all, a pretty good days diving but it is supposed to get 
			better (and warmer!) tomorrow.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th September </span>
            We had made it up to the Northern Komodo dive sites by 
			this morning meaning that we could go back to wearing shorties. The 
			first dive was at Batu Balong. As soon as we hit the water, you 
			could tell there was a huge improvement on yesterdays conditions. 
			The water was blue, and vis was incomparable to what it had been 
			like yesterday afternoon. While we had been exceptionally unlucky at 
			Pink Beach, I think we were very lucky here with perfect visibility 
			and no current. The dive site was excellent. We saw a few sharks but 
			it was the sheer number of fish around the island that made the dive 
			very enjoyable.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pk5J6FZGAXQ/UGkYX6065LI/AAAAAAAAGG0/AxVhflmLfCk/s320/IMG_6796.JPG"></a></div>
<p align="justify">
            The second dive at Shotgun was also very good. Once again, the 
			currents were no-where near as bad as they can be here and it was a 
			fairly easy dive. We saw more sharks as well as hawksbill turtles 
			and right at the end, a manta ray. We saw it briefly swimming past 
			as we were looking at a turtle and we were then able to watch it at 
			a cleaning station for a minute or two before it swam off.
</p>
<p align="justify">
			The third 
			dive was at Castle Rock and we did have some current for the first 
			time. There was an unbelievable number of fish at the start of the 
			dive including schools of giant travallies -&nbsp; some of the 
			biggest we have ever seen. There was another shark in the middle of 
			all the fish but it was the sheer numbers of fish in all directions 
			that made the dive memorable. This was the first (and probably last) 
			time we had tried using reef hooks - not a great success. They may 
			be useful when you get used to them or if the current is stronger 
			but they seemed more hassle than they were worth on this dive.</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			We were told by Cedric and Stanny, our guide, that the night dive 
			here would not be very good. They were both right! <br>
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PGuUgqKJbik/UGlVVDYnMnI/AAAAAAAAGHE/--slBCjG6M4/s320/IMG_3328.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th September </span>
            First dive of the day was at Crystal Rock, one of 
			Komodo's most famous sites. This was spectacular again and we did 
			manage to make use of our reef hooks with more success than 
			yesterday. On the second dive (Golden Passage) there was quite a 
			lot to see but a lot of the dive was spent photographing pygmy 
			sea-horses which got a bit boring after a while. There were several 
			sharks around and we got a distant glimpse of an eagle ray.
</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			The third dive was back at Castle Rock and was the best dive of the 
			live-aboard so far. At 3:00 we were told that there was very little 
			current and were given the option of waiting for the current to pick 
			up so there would be more to see. We chose to wait and did not go in 
			until 3:55 by which time there was no current at all! This did not 
			spoil the dive. Once again there was a huge number of fish around. 
			We did see sharks again but the large schools of fish swimming round 
			us for most of the dive, particularly the school of fusiliers in the 
			last 10 minutes were really spectacular. The complete lack of 
			current meant we could just stay in one place and watch them all.</p>
<p align="justify">The night dive was slightly better than last nights!</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 28th September </span>
            We started today at Makasar Reef - also known as Mantas 
			on da Moon. The whole site - about a mile long - is at about 9 - 12 
			metres and the bottom is bare and covered in rubble making it 
			resemble the surface of the moon. It is also a site famous for 
			mantas. We jumped in at one end of the reef and drifted with the 
			current past a series of manta cleaning stations. Our group saw 8 or 
			9 mantas in total during the dive.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-o-M6EPBSH_k/UGlem5HJJQI/AAAAAAAAGHY/hFeat7R9aBw/s320/IMG_3421.JPG"></div>
<p align="justify">
            The second dive was at Tatawa Kecil. This is where ReefSekers lost 
			divers a couple of years ago and the current was looking strong as 
			we got ready to dive. However, we managed to stay in the shelter of 
			the island for most of the dive and were never affected by it that 
			much.</p>
<p align="justify">This was another excellent dive with loads to see. We dropped 
			down to about 24m to watch three sharks swimming around. When we 
			moved from there we saw a hawksbill turtle. While we were all 
			looking at the turtle, another manta glided over us. This came 
			closer to me than any had on the previous dive. We saw a group of 
			about four or five bump-head parrot fish go past while watching 
			everything else. Because of the amount of time we had spent at 24m, 
			most of the group were getting quite low on air so we spent the last 
			third of the dive in a shallow coral garden. Here there was another 
			hawksbill swimming around which kept Roz entertained for 10 minutes 
			or so.
			</p>
<p align="justify">
			The third dive was quite a fast drift dive for about 1.5 miles along 
			the side of the island. We did spot a few turtles as we flew along 
			the reef (Roz counted six). The dive ended on a quieter reef with 
			nice coral again and no current. The fourth dive was supposed to be 
			a sunset dive but by the time everyone had decided what they were 
			doing and got themselves ready, it was just about a night dive. It 
			was however lots better than the night dives of the previous two 
			nights! We had decided not to bother with the mandarin fish which 
			Brad and Jurg were keen on seeing so left them at the top of the 
			reef. Within a few minutes, Stanny found a hairy octopus. He was 
			very excited about this and we spent about 20 minutes watching it 
			before moving on. There was loads more to see including another frog 
			fish and a pair of harlequin shrimps. Definitely one of our better 
			night dives.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th September </span>
            Our last day of diving on this live-aboard. We did two 
			dives in the morning. Both of these were pretty good without being 
			overly spectacular. On both dives there was very nice coral and 
			plenty of fish but not quite the same amount to see as on some of 
			the previous days dives.</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			We had expected to do two dives and have a trip to see the Komodo 
			dragons on Rinca in the afternoon but we were given the option of 
			doing a third dive at Wainilu (the location of yesterday's night 
			dive) instead of the dragons. We had been on the dragon trip twelve 
			years ago so took the option of the third dive instead despite the 
			fact that we fly at 10:05 tomorrow morning. 
			This was a good decision 
			as the third dive was one of the best of the trip (and the dragon 
			adventure sounded every bit as boring as it was twelve years ago!). 
			Only four us did the dive - me and Roz together with two of the 
			Asian divers. Everyone else had either come down with some sort of 
			bug or went to see the dragons. I was keen to see the harlequin 
			shrimps again. They had moved from where they were last night but 
			the guides managed to find them again. We also saw, three more frog 
			fish, two ribbon eels, two ornate ghost pipe fish and a sea-horse.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Zs4xyyHI9QM/UGlj1KlcEGI/AAAAAAAAGHs/BikHs5hYtIU/s320/IMG_3622.JPG"></div>
<p align="justify">
            We just about had the boat to ourselves when we got back from the 
			third dive. We were able to wash all our gear and get it hung up to 
			dry while waiting for everyone to return from seeing the dragons. 
			Once everyone was back on board, we returned to the harbour in 
			Labuan Bajo. It was not too lively on the boat - five of the 
			eighteen guests having come down with the bug - so after eating, we 
			went ashore to a "party" taking place in the harbour. Four of us 
			went as well as some of the Indonesian crew. We stayed there for 
			about an hour and were back on the boat by 10. Got to bed after 
			spending an hour or so looking at photos with Stanny.
			
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1TjoHuYRXBY/UGlj1VmVXsI/AAAAAAAAGHo/tI9CWQjXscw/s320/IMG_3626.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th September </span>
            We were up at 6:30 and had an hour and a half to pack 
			up our equipment and have breakfast before we had to leave. We left 
			the boat via the zodiacs again and then were transferred from the 
			pier to the airport. It was the end of a very good trip. The boat is 
			one of the best dive boats we have ever been on. The diving has been 
			excellent, the food good, and it has been a very good group of 
			people. We are already looking forward to coming back onto the same 
			boat for another trip in November!
			</p>
<p align="justify">
			Fourteen of us from the trip were on the same Trans Nusa flight back 
			to Bali at 10:30. The check-in was all a bit slow but we all got 
			checked in eventually and the flight left on time. We were back in 
			Bali by about 11:30 and after waiting around for a while for our 
			luggage, were met by a driver to take us to Reef Seen at Permuteran. 
			The journey to Permuteran took about four hours including a couple 
			of photo stops. It was a scenic route straight through the centre of 
			Bali with temples, lakes and mountains to look at on the way. We 
			arrived at Reef Seen just after 4 and were shown to our room. We met 
			up with Amanda who is one of the managers here and who used to swim 
			in Tadley with Roz. We had been carrying an underwater camera 
			housing for her from England so she was pleased to see us! Once 
			again, we have a nice room that just about has a sea view from the 
			balcony. The balcony is also about 10m from the turtle hatchery 
			which has over 400 baby olive ridley turtles and one fully grown 
			hawksbill. Plenty to keep Roz entertained for the next six days!</p>
			
<p align="justify">
			Again, we were both worn out from both the last week's diving 
			and the travelling today. We spent an hour or so catching up on what 
			has been happening in the world as we had internet access for the 
			first time in a week, and went out to eat at a restaurant just 
			behind where we are staying. We were both asleep just after 9.</p>
