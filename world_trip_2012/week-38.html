            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 11th February
                </span>We checked out and left the hotel by 7:30. We had a few problems finding
                our way out of Campeche but were on the right road by 8ish. We drove directly to
                our first set of ruins at Edsna and were parked by 8:45. Edzna was a smaller
                site than some of the others but still had a few impressive buildings. We were
                the only ones at the site when we went in and only saw a few other people the
                whole time we were there. We were not able to climb up the biggest of the
                building but were able to climb a few of the others.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Edzna at about 10:00 and had quite a long drive to our next site. We
                were heading across to the East coast of Yucatan as we will be returning to the
                beaches in a couple of days time. It took us four hours to get to Becan with a
                stop for breakfast on the way. Becan was a similar size to Edzna and was again
                very good. We were able to climb the main building here although later found a
                sign saying that they would rather you did not do so. There were ropes to help
                you climb here which they probably should remove if they do not want people
                climbing on them!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Both of these sites were very good to visit although we are probably reaching
                the limit to the amount of ruins we can look at. Just visiting two in the same
                day means that they start blurring into one. We left Becan and continued driving
                to Chetumal giving two Spanish hitch-hikers a lift for most of the way. We got
                to Chetumal at 5:30ish. We had not booked anywhere to stay here as we had not
                been sure how far we would get today but we found a motel type place on the
                outskirts of the town centre which was fine for the night. We walked into the
                town centre to eat and were back in the room by 8:00.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 12th February
                </span>We left the hotel at about 8:30 and drove to a big supermarket. We will
                be spending most of the next week (from tomorrow) at a couple of quite isolated
                beaches. The first one in particular is a long way from anywhere and we wanted
                to stock up on food and drink while we had the chance. We sat and had breakfast
                in the supermarket car park and then drove to our sixth and final set of ruins
                at Kuhunlich about 50km back the way we had come yesterday.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QivNZRtn9Bk/USEt1plvwbI/AAAAAAAAJqI/n_IwV9774RA/s320/IMG_1597.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about 30 minutes at this site. These were not as spectacular as some of
                the others we have been to and we have now got to the point where we have seen
                enough! We drove from there to Lake Balacar which is on the way to where we are
                staying tomorrow. Again, we had not booked anywhere to stay but we were there by
                lunchtime and after looking at a couple of places, got a room at The Laguna
                Hotel. The room was a bit basic but had a big balcony with a superb view of the
                lake. We did not leave the room for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After sorting out some washing, we spent the rest of the
                afternoon reading on the balcony. We ate in the hotel restaurant in the evening
                and had a few drinks on the balcony before going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 13th February
                </span>Woke up and realised that we had underestimated the amount of alcohol
                that we needed to buy yesterday. More than half of it was gone already! We were
                still only 25 miles from Chetumal so I drove back to the supermarket to
                replenish our supplies before we left Balacar.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img
                src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p7iDzs-Oqog/USEtyoIrKyI/AAAAAAAAJqA/0-vTHqDhAfU/s320/IMG_1603.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We filled up with petrol (and got ripped off by the pump attendant) and started
                heading for the coast at 10:30ish. We stopped in Mahuhual to pay a deposit at
                the place we will be staying in from Sunday and then continued South to
                Xcalak. We did not have to far to go today but a lot of the roads we were on
                were un-surfaced or full of pot-holes so it was quite slow going. We arrived at
                Casa Carolina at 1ish. This is a small place with four rooms right on the beach.
                We have a room with a kitchenette and a balcony with a view that is even better
                than last night's.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We are hoping to dive here on at least one day but there are very strong winds
                here at the moment and these have prevented boats going out for the last four
                days. We have provisionally booked to dive tomorrow but will not find out until
                9am whether or not it will be possible. Did not do a lot for the rest of the
                day. Casa Carolina is a really nice place to stay on an excellent beach. The one
                drawback is that it is quite a long way from any shops or restaurants. We had to
                drive into Xcalak to eat but did have very good meals at Toby's Taco Night.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 14th February
                </span>We were up an hour earlier than planned due to my phone still being set
                to Cuban time! We sorted out our dive gear and went to breakfast at 7:30. We
                found out just before 9:00 that the wind had dropped sufficiently for the boat
                to get out over the reef so we were able to dive.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by boat from the small jetty right in front of where we are
                staying. We had chosen to dive with the smaller of the two dive centres in
                Xcalak and it was just the captain and Luis, our dive guide on the boat. It took
                about 15 minutes to get to the first dive site and involved a South
                African style trip through the surf to get through a small gap in the reef. It
                was easy to see why this had not been possible yesterday! We were not that
                impressed with the first dive. The vis was poor and there did not seem to be a
                huge amount to see anyway. We were back to diving with aluminium tanks again
                which felt a lot more comfortable than the steel 120's we had been using in
                Cozumel.</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zd8JVMCkoAE/USEtyLLme2I/AAAAAAAAJp4/czmE36RFMcg/s320/IMG_1613.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had most of the surface interval back at the hotel before going out to do the
                second dive which was a lot better. There was more current on this dive but a
                lot more fish. There were big schools of tarpon at the start. We have seen a few
                of these before but never in such large numbers. There were also large schools
                of jacks and tuna which did not seem bothered by divers at all. After this dive,
                we booked a second days diving for tomorrow. Although the dives were not great,
                it is easy diving and the sites are not too far away. Getting picked up by boat
                and coming back between dives is ideal.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the room by 1:30 and, after washing our gear, had lunch on the
                balcony. The rest of the afternoon was spent reading on the beach which we had
                to ourselves as the other rooms were all empty until the evening. We drove back
                into Xcalak to eat in the evening. We ate at Sylvia's (next door to Toby's) and
                had excellent tacos again. There was quite a long wait for the food to come and
                we had just about decided that we would not eat here again but as soon as we
                tasted the tacos, we knew we would be back again tomorrow. We had a few more
                drinks on the balcony before going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 15th February
                </span>We were picked up from the jetty again at 9:00. Both dives were very good
                today. The first had some spectacular caves and a long chimney. The second
                seemed to have a lot more fish than our other dives here and we also saw four
                turtles. The rest of the day was similar to yesterday. We spent the afternoon
                reading on the beach.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got eaten by mosquitoes. I usually do not bother with insect
                repellent; I would rather have a few bites. However, within a few minutes of
                sitting on the balcony at 6ish, I was getting more bites than I think I have
                ever had at one time before. Even after putting deet on, I was getting bitten
                through my clothes and on any spot that did not have deet on. Roz was only on
                the balcony a few minutes before we had to go and sit in the room.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Sylvia's for the shrimp tacos again and were able to sit on the
                balcony again by the time we got back. We finished the wine we had bought in
                Cuba and got through quite a bit of the other alcohol we had bought and do not
                remember going to bed.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 16th February
                </span>Did not really do a lot all day. We were not too hung-over but there is
                not a lot to do here when not diving apart from sit around and read. Both of us
                are covered in bites from the five minutes on the balcony last night! We went to
                Sylvia's for shrimp tacos for the third evening in a row and were back by 8.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 17th February
                </span>We left Casa Carolina at 11:00 after the Liverpool v Swansea game
                finished. The internet access here was not fast enough to be able to watch the
                game which was probably for the best!</p>

            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4_loo-5OWS0/USGXTjYNl0I/AAAAAAAAJzU/mZIB7fV6CYk/s320/IMG_7419.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It took about an hour to drive to the next place we are staying, Balamku Inn,
                about 5km South of Mahahual. This is another place with a few rooms on the beach
                like at Tulum and Xcalak. This is probably the nicest of the rooms we have
                stayed in at any of these places and our room is only a few metres from the sea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Unfortunately, the wind has really picked up again and it
                is not that warm. It is similar to the weather when we first arrived in Mexico
                and the diving that we have booked for tomorrow is again in doubt.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove into Mahuhual in the evening. There are a couple of restaurants within
                walking distance of where we are staying but they were both closed tonight. We
                ate at Nohoch Kay, recommended to us by someone where we are staying and had
                shrimp tacos again! After a walk around the town, we drove back to the hotel.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">Just before going to bed, I realised I no longer had a
                mobile phone. I definitely had it in Xcalak so it looks as if it has been left
                there somehow.</p>
