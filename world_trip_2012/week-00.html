<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 25th May</span>
			The start of the trip was three days earlier than planned due to 
			England's friendly in Oslo. We left Kingsclere at 1:20 and headed 
			for Heathrow, stopping for lunch in a pub on the way. We got to 
			Heathrow, parked and got through security without any problems and 
			were sat in the bar by about 3:30. There were supposed to be five of 
			us going to Oslo but Paddy Dave had already had to pull out and 
			Steve and Kim almost missed the flight as they got stuck in traffic 
			- they eventually made it with a few minutes to spare. Had an 
			uneventful flight and then a 30 minute taxi ride to the apartment in 
			the centre of Oslo.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It was quite late by the time we arrived but there were bars and 
			restaurants round the corner from where we were staying so we went 
			out for a few drinks. All seemed nice enough but with beer costing 
			around £10 a pint, it was only a few! Ended up sat in a brewery, 
			sipping our beer until about 2am.</p>

<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 26th May</span>
            Woke up to find that Roz had lost her iTouch. 
			This was not a good start to the trip, but after phoning the very efficient 
			lost property office at Oslo airport we were told that it had been 
			found on the plane and we could pick it up tomorrow. Once that panic 
			was over, we had breakfast in the apartment and by about midday, 
			headed off to start our sight-seeing of Oslo.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">We went first to the 
			hotel where the FA were staying so we could check in and return 
			Dave's ticket. We collected our Free Lions from the station and went 
			for a walk around the harbour area and fort where we saw the 
			changing of the guard. All quite nice without being too spectacular 
			- something that could be said to describe Oslo in general! We 
			walked from the harbour back to the centre of town taking in a few 
			of the other buildings on the way.&nbsp; We thought about stopping 
			for a drink but were put off by the prices so we all headed back to 
			the apartment stopping at a supermarket to buy a six-pack of Tuborg 
			on the way. Spent the rest of the afternoon sat around in the 
			apartment drinking the lager.</p>

 <p  class="diary-text">
            We headed out again at about 5:30 and managed to 
			find a bar with slightly more reasonable prices - about £5 for half 
			a litre of lager! After a couple in there, we had something to eat 
			in a tapas restaurant and caught the metro out to the football 
			ground. The game was also not too spectacular but at least England 
			did win (1 - 0). Got on the metro as soon as the game had finished and were 
			able to spend another couple of hours at the brewery before 
			returning to the apartment at 2 again. Although none of us were that 
			impressed with Oslo, it had been a good day out despite the 
			ridiculously high prices for just about everything.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 27th May</span>
            Had another late breakfast before checking out 
			of the apartment just after midday. Roz and I had another walk round 
			Oslo, this time walking up to the Royal Palace, while Steve and Kim 
			went looking for presents/souvenirs. We were back at the apartment 
			by 1:30 so had an hour lying in the park making the most of the 
			weather.</p>
			
<p  class="diary-text">We had booked the same taxi driver that had 
			bought us here to take us back to the airport. He turned up early 
			and we were on our way by 2:45ish. At the airport we collected Roz's 
			iTouch&nbsp; and waited for our flight which left on time at 5:10. 
			We were back at Heathrow by 6:30, collected the car and drove to 
			Maidstone for the start of the next leg of the trip. We checked into 
			a Travelodge and got a takeaway pizza before a relatively early 
			night.</p>
