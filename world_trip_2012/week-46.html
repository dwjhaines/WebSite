                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 11th April
                </span>The start of the final leg of the World Trip! The day started with John's
                funeral in Edwalton. We had been due to fly out to Bangkok last night but had
                managed to move two flights and two hotel bookings while only losing £60 which
                did not work out too badly. The funeral all went OK and we had plenty of time to
                drive down to Heathrow. We arrived at Heathrow slightly earlier than planned and
                had the car collected from outside terminal 3 by about 5pm. We checked in and
                headed to the BA lounge, probably for the last time at Heathrow as our Silver
                membership will expire in the next couple of months.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We made the most of our last visit as we had about four hours in the lounge.
                Both felt quite light-headed by the time we left to get on the plane. The flight
                left on time just after 10pm. We had a few bottles of wine with our meal and
                then got through about half a litre of Bacardi. Not really sure what time we
                fell asleep.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 12th April
                </span>Woke up just before breakfast was served having managed to get a few
                hours sleep. We landed on time at about 3:30pm local time and got through
                immigration with no problems. We collected our luggage and then checked in for
                the 18:45 flight to Samui. We had nearly 3 hours to wait which was not too bad
                as there is a lounge for all Bangkok Airways passengers. No free alcohol but
                fruit juice, sandwiches and free Wi-Fi. We left slightly late and arrived in
                Samui at about 8:30. We were met at the airport by a taxi from the hotel we had
                booked at Bo Phut beach. It took about 15 minutes to get there and we were in
                our room by 9ish. We went out for a quick look around Bo Phut, got something to
                eat and were back in the room by 10:30.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 13th April
                </span>The plan for today had been for a lazy morning by the pool before
                catching the 1:30 ferry to Koh Tao where we will spend most of the next week.
                However, we found out last night that the main celebrations for Songkran (Thai
                New Year) take place today. We had thought it would be the 14th which is new
                years day itself but apparently not. Songkran involves everyone going out in the
                street and throwing water over each other and passersby. It brings places to
                complete standstills and means we would have big problems getting to the ferry
                pier. We were also told that the ferries would be full and as we did not have
                tickets booked, we were unlikely to get on one.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided that the best bet would be to get up early and head for the ferry
                pier before the festivities began. We were up at 6:30, checked out at 6:50 and
                got a taxi to the pier at Bang Rak. As soon as we got the the pier we were able
                to buy tickets for the 8:00 ferry and, much to our relief, were given our
                stickers. The boat was full but left just about on time and arrived in Koh Tao
                at 10:15. We walked to Master Divers and filled in the paperwork for diving and
                left all our gear in the equipment room. By the time we had left there and
                walked to Ananda Villas, our room was ready and we were able to check in. We
                were both worn out by the time we got there so had showers and a couple of hours
                sleep before going out to lunch.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img
                src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TzT9vWBpXcw/UWq79EkRN2I/AAAAAAAAK_8/fcJV_RBqfFw/s320/IMG_1361.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Koh Tao has changed a lot in the 10 years since we were here last but the small
                restaurant that we used to eat at - Mae Haad Seafood - was still there so we
                went there for lunch. People had been quite restrained with the amount of water
                that they threw at us while we had our luggage but by now, we were getting
                frequently soaked as we walked around. The festival also seems to involve a lot
                of all day drinking which seemed to increase people's enthusiasm! After lunch we
                went for a walk around Mae Haad and bought drinks from 7-11 before returning to
                the room to get out of our wet clothes. It is not ideal weather for Songkran. It
                should be very hot at the moment but there was a big storm here last night and
                it is dull, humid and cloudy today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We started drinking at about 5:30. We have quite a nice balcony here which just
                about has a sea view. We ate at Mae Haad Seafood again as a lot of restaurants
                were close due to Songkran. After eating, we found a bar that was showing
                English football and let us take in our own bottles of Sang Som. We stayed in
                there until the end of the Reading v Liverpool game and do not remember much
                about getting home.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 14th April
                </span>Did not do a lot all day today. The dive centre was closed due to
                Songkran and the weather was poor with heavy rain for a lot of the time. Spent
                most of the day catching up on sleep or sitting on the balcony. We made it out
                at 6pm to watch the Newcastle v Sunderland game in The Safety Stop and then ate
                in a near-by restaurant. Back in the hotel before 9:00.</p>
