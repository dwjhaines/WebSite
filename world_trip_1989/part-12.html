                We got up at 7, packed, checked out of the hotel and walked to another ticket office by 7:45. There was no direct ferry at 9:30 so we bought tickets for one that stopped on the way at Batam. this takes a bit longer but is still a lot easier than the alternative. We went for breakfast- egg curry - and were at the port by 9. We boarded the  boat which was pretty luxurious compared to what we were used to (A.C. and video) and left promptly at 9:30. We stopped for half an hour at Batam island to clear Indonesian immigration and arrived in Singapore at 1:30 local time.

                Singapore seemed an incredible place at first sight. We probably wouldn't have thought much of it if we'd just come from Sydney or even Christchurch but after three weeks in Indonesia it seemed like another world. We walked through the business section of town to get to the G.P.O. at Raffles Quay. We had a card from Dave saying where he was staying and I also got Â£100 of postal orders from Dad.  Dave turned up while I was cashing the postal orders so we went with him on the underground to his hotel and checked into a room. We had to pay about three times as much for the room as last nights.

                We spent about two hours sitting around discussing the last three weeks before going out for tea. We walked along Orchard Road, one of the main shopping centres of Singapore. The whole road was one shopping centre after another all air-conditioned and very nice but pretty boring after a while. We went to one of the hawker centres for tea by which time I wasn't feeling too well. The food was pretty good and cheap though all I could think about was having something cold to drink. We walked back to the hotel and were in bed by 10.

                * Dave had been to Tanjung Pinang over the weekend and was traveling from there to Singapore while we were traveling in the opposite direction from Batam. We only missed him by three hours in Tanjung Pinang. Because of this, our one and a half hour flight delay at Padang has ended up saving us quite a bit of money.

                We spent the morning sorting out bus tickets away from Singapore. We wanted to go to Kuantan, on the East coast of Malaysia and by about midday we had managed to buy tickets for the overnight bus leaving at 10pm. We checked out of the hotel but left our luggage there while we went out to see the sights. We spent about an hour and a half in the McDonalds drinking coke and making the most of the air-conditioning. Roz and I then went to the post office where we had a letter from Cathy, returned to the McDonalds to meet Dave and then the three of us went out to the Science Centre.

                We stayed there until it closed and then caught the underground back. The nderground is the thing that has impressed me most in Singapore.
