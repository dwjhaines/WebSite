                We were woken at 3 and put on a bus back to the airport. We were given our passports and boarding passes back with remarkable inefficiency and got back into the departure lounge by about 5. The plane was due to leave at 5:35 and finally took off at 6. |the flight only lasted an hour during which time we were given a pretty good chicken curry.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We landed at 7 and cleared customs and changed money by 7:45. We walked out of the airport and crossed the road to the station where we caught a commuter train into Madras for 3 rupees each. The train was pretty full but it was only for about 20 minutes and we managed to get seats by the time we reached Madras.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about an hour looking at hotels before getting a rickshaw to Broadlands, about a mile away. We got a room for three for 120 rupees. We lay in the room for about half an hour before getting a rickshaw to Central Railway Station to try and book tickets for the next week. The station booking hall was an amazing place. There were hundreds of Indians trying to book tickets at the desks at the main part of the booking hall and a nice little office with chairs round the back for tourists.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were there for about an hour, first of all booking sleepers out of Madras for tomorrow night on the train to Ooty. We had a few problems booking our tickets from Ooty for four days time but after about half an hour, we had an alternative route suggested to us so everything worked out quite well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the booking office at 11:45 and went to the station cafe for lunch. While at the station we booked ourselves onto a city sight-seeing tour and then went back to the hotel for a couple of hours sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for tea at a restaurant just round the corner from the hotel. The meal was superb. We had starters, curries, naan, etc for about 40p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After our meal, we spent about half an hour walking round the area surrounding the hotel. When we were nearly back at the hotel, we were offered grass by a bloke called John. He took me off on his bike to his house and gave me a sample to go and try. After consulting Dave and Roz, we didn't want to buy anything from him because it seemed expensive and I didn't know if I could trust John. I went and told him and he insisted I kept the free sample (about £15 worth in The Bondi Hotel). I told him I would see him again tomorrow night.

                We had breakfast at the same place we had eaten at last night and then got a tuk-tuk to Central Railway Station. We had a two and a half hour wait for our tour to start. We all made trips to the post office and then I went in search of a bank that changed travelers cheques. This involved getting a cycle rickshaw to the bank and wait outside as I had no money to pay him and then take me back again. A good 15 rupees worth!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left our luggage at the station cloakroom, had lunch and then waited for our tour to start. The tour lasted from 2 until just after 6. Most of the palces we went were pretty boring but it was quite good being driven round the city for the afternoon.

                We were dropped in Mt Road, so we went to a restaurant from the book for tea. We caught a tuk-tuk back to Central Station, collected our rucksacks and went to wait for the 9pm train to Mettupalayam. We were on the platform by 8 and the train pulled into the station about 20 minutes later. Our names were on a list pasted to the outside of our carriage, an amazing feat considering the chaos of the booking hall!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bunks were pretty comfortable and the train quite cool so we all had a good nights sleep!

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 6th September</span>
                We arrived in Mettupalayam at 7:20 and transfered to the 1m guage train to take us to Ooty. This train was pushed by a steam engine with a central cog for getting up steep hills. The journey was quite scenic though not as good as the book had led us to believe, and was pretty slow. The 40km to Ooty took over four hours so we didn't arrive until 12:15.

                We went round a few hotels before taking a room at the first place we had looked at for 60 rupees a night. We walked into the Charing Cross area of Ooty and had an all you can eat thali meal. We were given large plates were waited on for half an hour by about a dozen waiters who kept filling up our various curry dishes and bringing more rice, popadoms, etc. We walked back to the hotel via various sweet and cake shops and went to sleep for the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had all woken up, it was tea time so we walked back to the same area where we had lunch and went to a different restaurant. This one had a uniformed doorman who saluted us as we entered, the usual selection of waiters and the meal still only came to about 50p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were offered grass again on the way back to the hotel. This time, the bloke who tried to sell  us the grass took us to a cafe and gave us a joint before telling us to come back tomorrow if we wanted to buy any. We walked back to the hotel and started smoking John's free sample and all got stoned for the first time since March.

                We got up at 10 and at 11, Dave and I went to score. The deal seemed a lot better and safer than the one we had been offered in Madras and we were buying a much smaller quantity. After buying about £1.50 worth, we went for lunch at the same place as yesterday. We went back to the hotel for a couple of hours and then walked down to the lake and hired a peddle boat for an hour. The lake was full of Indian tourists who seem to like holidaying in Ooty. 
            </p>

                We walked back to the hotel for our afternoon sleep before going out for tea. Just before we left the room, an Indian bloke who had seem us in the cafe last night came and asked us for rolling papers. We were all concerned as we hadn't told anyone where we were staying so after a lot of thought, we decided to throw the grass away as opposed to risk getting caught with it in our room. All the evidence destroyed, we went out to the same restaurant as last night.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th September</span>
                We got up, packed and checked out of the hotel by 11, left our rucksacks at reception and went off into town again. We bought food for our train journeys later in the day - a healthy combination of Bombay Mix, bananas and Smarties and then went for yet another thali lunch. We bought a box of cakes before getting a tuk-tuk back to the station, collecting our bags and then waiting for the 2:55 train to Mettupalayam. Ooty has been quite a good place to stay for a couple of days although all we seemed to do was eat and sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We boarded the train at 2, it left on time and arrived three and a half hours later. At Mettupalayam we boarded the Nilgiri Express for the second time, this time heading back towards Madras. This was potentially the worst journey of the day as we were traveling 2nd class unreserved for about three and a half hours. The journey was however, much better than expected and we had seats all the way. We arrived at Erode at 10:25 and then had a three and a half hour wait for our train to Trivandrum.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 9th September</span>
                The train arrived on time at 1:25am - we boarded and departed at 1:30. We only had two sleeping births reserved but managed to pay for a third one on the train. We had the customary argument about who was having which bunk and got to bed by 1:45.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I woke quite early to find that most of our compartment was empty. Although the train was full, we had six seats in the ladies compartment to ourselves fo rnearly all of the remainder of the trip to Trivandrum. We arrived in Trivandrum just after midday and, together with a Scottish bloke we picked up at the station, piled into a tuk-tuk for the ten mile drive to Kovalam. The journey was quite eventful. Just outside Trivandrum we collided with a moped that was trying to overtake us on the inside. There was much standing around discussing the situation before we were on our way again.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At Kovalam we were taken to The Raj Hotel which seemed such good value that we didn't bother going to look at any others. We got a double room (for three) with a bathroom for £1.50 a night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The beach itself, a two minute walk from the hotel is probably the best we have been to yet. There are plenty of restaurants and shops yet it is not over commercialised or too touristy.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had curry fir lunch, walked all the way along the beach and then returned to the room for a couple of hours sleep. We left it quite late in the afternoon before we decided to do any sun-bathing and then only spent about an hour on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went to one of the many restaurants on the beach. All of the restaurants are pretty good but the food seems to take at least an hour to be served. Despite the wait, an excellent meal.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 10th September</span>
                After breakfast, we had to go into Trivandrum to reserve train tickets for next week (we had decided to stay at Kovalam until next Monday). We caught the bus into Trivandrum and then walked to the railway station. Unlike the bug city stations, there is no special tourist ticket office at Trivandrum so we had to join the queue of Indians. We joined the queue at 12:15 and eventually got our tickets at 3:30. We started walking back to the bus station but got diverted by a sign advertising foreign liquor. We found the bottle shop which sold not a lot other than brandy.

                We purchased three bottles of various different qualities and then decided to have a drink at the bar at one side of the shop. The bar also sold nothing but brandy so we had three with lemonade. We were sitting in an incredibly grotty room containing nothing but tables and chairs and an occasional rat, but the brandy tasted quite good. We had another, which led to another and eventually, a major session developed. We gave up on the idea of going back by bus and carried on drinking. I don't remember anything after leaving the bar but apparently we got a tuk-tuk back to Kovalam, went for a meal and then staggered back to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 11th to Sunday 16th September</span>
                The week passed pretty quickly. We didn't do a lot apart from lie in the room, lie on the beach or sit in restaurants eating curries.

                Tuesday was spent largely in the room due to hangovers. When we did decide to go out, we went round the souvenir shops looking for presents for everyone. After about two hours and ten shops, we returned with ten wooden elephants.

                On Wednesday, I managed to sell the cassette player that I had bought in Perth last April. Someone came to our room offering to change money or sell us dope and when he saw the cassette player, said he would buy it from me. I managed to get £15 for it - I would happily have accepted £10 - and we also changed $100 (1900 rupees instead of 1745)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another session on Thursday night. We took two of our bottles of brandy to a restaurant and drank them with our meal. We then paid a 30p deposit and took our glasses back to the room and drank the third bottle. I don't remember going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">On Friday, we had bad hangovers. Apart from going to breakfast (where we managed to buy a 10g lump of hash for £6) and a trip to the post office that half killed me, we hardly left the room all day.

                We got up at 6, left the hotel at 6:15 and went for breakfast by 6:30. We walked along the beach to the bus station (passing hundreds of jelly fish that had been washed up overnight) and caught the 7:30 bus to Quillon. We managed to hit two other buses along the way but arrived in Quillon at about 10.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At Quillon, we boarded a boat for the eight and a half hour backwater trip to Alleppey. The boat trip was pretty good, passing through fishing villages and islands and the sunset was also spectacular. Not quite the highlight of our visit to Kerala as the book suggests but not a bad way of spending a day

We had a one and a half hour bus ride to Emakelum where we got a tuk-tuk out to the town railway station and sat waiting for the 4:45 train to Bangalore. This was the train we had reserved last Monday in Trivandrum so we all had sleeping berths.

                At Bangalore station, for our overnight trip to Goa on Friday. We had expected to find the same sort of chaos that we had in Trivandrum booking hall, but instead found a separate queue for tourists and went straight to the front. According to the lists that were up, there were no sleepers left on the train we wanted to go on but they had a tourist quota so we booked our births and were out of the station by 7:20.

                We crossed over to the bus station and found a direct non-stop bus to Mysore. We had "seats" in the drivers compartment for the three hour journey and arrived in Mysore at 11. We spent about half an hour looking at rooms before settling on a room for 85 rupees with a bathroom and a balcony that overlooks Ghandi Square and the traffic jams in the street below.

                We went out for a thali lunch and then spent a couple of hours walking round the souvenir shops, Mysore being the handicrafts centre of Southern India. The only things we bought were 6 rupees worth of joss sticks and we returned to the hotel at 3:30. Fifteen minutes later , we set off to climb Chamundi Hill. We got a tuk-tuk to the base and then climbed just over 1000 steps to get to the top. We were shown around the temple by a guide who told us it was free but then trip to charge us over £1. After and argument that nearly involved the police, we gave him 60p and set off to look at more shops. As Roz's legs were tired, we caught the bus back down to Mysore instead of  walking.

                Dave woke up feeling ill after being sick twice during the night so we canceled our planned excursion to Somanathapura.

                Roz and I went sight-seeing to the Mah Raja's palace in the morning. We accidentally went to the museum first of all - a total waste of time and 2 rupees and then managed to find our way into the palace itself. The palace was reasonably interesting to walk around though I was more impressed with the elephants outside.

                After a late lunch, we sat around the room for a couple of hours and then the three of us went round the souvenir shops again mainly buying wooden boxes. In the evening I ate meat for the first time in India.

                We had breakfast at about 9 then Roz and I spent nearly an hour haggling over the price of a table she wanted to buy. She eventually got it for Rp1,060. We returned to the hotel, packed up all our stuff and checked out by 11:30. We got a tuk-tuk to the bus station where we got a non-stop bus to Bangalore.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Bangalore, we had about three hours to kill before our train departed, so we got a tuk-tuk to the British Library. Here we found English newspapers so we spent an hour and a half reading about the first month of the football season. It was the first time we had seen any results since the season started.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had tea, went back to the station and got on the 17:10 train to Vasco Da Gamma. We were originally given births in the two tier sleeper compartment (not as good as usual) but managed to get transferred to the three tier after the first stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent the evening playing cards and eating biscuits.

                We arrived in Margoa just after midday and got a tuk-tuk for the 10km to Colva Beach. We got dropped near a cafe so Dave waited there while Roz and I went round looking for a place to stay for the next week. We saw a few places before settling on the Colmar Hotel. Here we were offered a two floor apartment type thing with a decent bathroom for 100 rupees a night. We went back to collect Dave and the rucksacks and moved in. The hotel is excellently situated, less than 100m from the beach with a superb sea view from the upstairs window.

            <p class="diary-text">
                By this time it was about 3:30. We went out for lunch and then a walk along the beach. The beach here is not as good as at Kovalam, though it is still one of the best I have been to. Unfortunately, all of the beach cafes (one of Colva's major attractions) haev been closed down by the health department but there seems to be quite a good selection of other restaurants and and they all serve cheap beer!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a meal in our hotel restaurant for tea as none of us had the energy to walk any further.

                A lazy day. Roz and I spent too long on the beach and both ended up with sun-burn. Dave is still recovering from the effects of his illness in Mysore.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the evening, we decided we had better sort out our travel plans for when we leave here so we can book train tickets. We eventually settled on staying in Goa an extra four or five days , either at Colva or another beach, missing out on Bombay and the Ajanta Caves, and then getting a train direct to Agra. where we hope to arrive in two weeks time. We will stay there for two nights and then go to Delhi to try and book flights home.

                We got up early, had breakfast and caught the 8 o'clock bus into Margoa. We had no problems booking three sleepers on the train to Delhi on Oct 4th and even managed to get on a train that was six hours quicker than expected. Next we caught a bus to Panaji, an hour and a half journey, where we had to collect mail from the G.P.O. and change money. After we had eaten lunch, we got another bus back to Margoa. During this journey, we had our fourth accident since getting to India when a small boy ran out into the road. He wasn't badly injured but the bus had to stay where it was so we had to get on another. Back at Margoa we got on our sixth bus of the day back to Colva where we arrived at 4:30 hot and worn out.

                It was cloudy and wet for most of the day so we didn't do a lot except get stoned and eat sweets.

                Roz and I wen tinto Margoa in the morning intending to phone home. After walking round in circles for half an hour we found the telegraph office which was about 20m from where we had got off the bus. The telegraph office was total chaos and it cost £6 for a three minute phone call. We decided not to bother. We had a quick look around the shops and then got the bus back to Colva.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon and also went round the shops of Colva. They aren't as good as the ones in Kovalam but I did manage to find a new bag. (my rucksack is half full of Roz's table!)

                An uneventful day. Spent a couple of hours at the beach, wrote postcards, got stoned again, etc

                After breakfast, we hired bikes and cycled into Margoa. We posted letters and Roz bought a stool she wanted and we returned to Colva.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of hours rest and then cycled along the beach to a cafe near Benaulim for lunch. We decided that after all our exercise we deserved a beer with our meal and this led to us spending the afternoon drinking. We cycled back to Colva and returned the bikes at 6ish and continued drinking in the room until the electricity went off at 7.

                We went out for tea and had to eat our meal by candle-light as the whole of Colva was in darkness. We had a few more beers and went back to the room again. The power still had not come on so we had a couple of joints and went to bed.

                Woke up with a slight hangover, went for breakfast and then returned to bed. The electricity finally came back on around 11. Most of the day was wet and cloudy so we spent most of the day lying in bed.

                Another cloudy day so, again, we didn't do a lot. Roz phoned home in the afternoon and got her parents to phone Llansteffan and give Mum our phone number here. She phoned back twice, both times we were cut off after a minute. Jane should be getting home a couple of weeks before me, but apart from finding that out, we didn't get a chance to say much.

                We decided to have our "leaving Goa" session today so we don't have hangovers on Thursday. We started to drink the brandy in our room and went out at 4 to continue drinking..... only to discover that today is a dry day due to it being Ghandi's birthday or something. We found one restaurant that could get us beer in an hour so we ordered six bottles and went to lunch. We went to pick up the bottles, ordered six more for two hours time and smuggled them back to the room.

                During the evening, we got through the twelve bottles of beer and another bottle of brandy. We had our evening meal bought to the room so we didn't have to go out. Fell asleep about 1 I think.

                Had a hangover for most of the day. We stayed in the room just about all day except for when we went out for meals.
