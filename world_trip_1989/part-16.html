                We were woken at 3 and put on a bus back to the airport. We were given our passports and boarding passes back with remarkable inefficiency and got back into the departure lounge by about 5. The plane was due to leave at 5:35 and finally took off at 6. |the flight only lasted an hour during which time we were given a pretty good chicken curry.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We landed at 7 and cleared customs and changed money by 7:45. We walked out of the airport and crossed the road to the station where we caught a commuter train into Madras for 3 rupees each. The train was pretty full but it was only for about 20 minutes and we managed to get seats by the time we reached Madras.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about an hour looking at hotels before getting a rickshaw to Broadlands, about a mile away. We got a room for three for 120 rupees. We lay in the room for about half an hour before getting a rickshaw to Central Railway Station to try and book tickets for the next week. The station booking hall was an amazing place. There were hundreds of Indians trying to book tickets at the desks at the main part of the booking hall and a nice little office with chairs round the back for tourists.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were there for about an hour, first of all booking sleepers out of Madras for tomorrow night on the train to Ooty. We had a few problems booking our tickets from Ooty for four days time but after about half an hour, we had an alternative route suggested to us so everything worked out quite well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the booking office at 11:45 and went to the station cafe for lunch. While at the station we booked ourselves onto a city sight-seeing tour and then went back to the hotel for a couple of hours sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for tea at a restaurant just round the corner from the hotel. The meal was superb. We had starters, curries, naan, etc for about 40p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After our meal, we spent about half an hour walking round the area surrounding the hotel. When we were nearly back at the hotel, we were offered grass by a bloke called John. He took me off on his bike to his house and gave me a sample to go and try. After consulting Dave and Roz, we didn't want to buy anything from him because it seemed expensive and I didn't know if I could trust John. I went and told him and he insisted I kept the free sample (about Â£15 worth in The Bondi Hotel). I told him I would see him again tomorrow night.

                We had breakfast at the same place we had eaten at last night and then got a tuk-tuk to Central Railway Station. We had a two and a half hour wait for our tour to start. We all made trips to the post office and then I went in search of a bank that changed travelers cheques. This involved getting a cycle rickshaw to the bank and wait outside as I had no money to pay him and then take me back again. A good 15 rupees worth!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left our luggage at the station cloakroom, had lunch and then waited for our tour to start. The tour lasted from 2 until just after 6. Most of the palces we went were pretty boring but it was quite good being driven round the city for the afternoon.

                We were dropped in Mt Road, so we went to a restaurant from the book for tea. We caught a tuk-tuk back to Central Station, collected our rucksacks and went to wait for the 9pm train to Mettupalayam. We were on the platform by 8 and the train pulled into the station about 20 minutes later. Our names were on a list pasted to the outside of our carriage, an amazing feat considering the chaos of the booking hall!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bunks were pretty comfortable and the train quite cool so we all had a good nights sleep!
