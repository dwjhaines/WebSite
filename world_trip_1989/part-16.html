                We were woken at 3 and put on a bus back to the airport. We were given our passports and boarding passes back with remarkable inefficiency and got back into the departure lounge by about 5. The plane was due to leave at 5:35 and finally took off at 6. |the flight only lasted an hour during which time we were given a pretty good chicken curry.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We landed at 7 and cleared customs and changed money by 7:45. We walked out of the airport and crossed the road to the station where we caught a commuter train into Madras for 3 rupees each. The train was pretty full but it was only for about 20 minutes and we managed to get seats by the time we reached Madras.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about an hour looking at hotels before getting a rickshaw to Broadlands, about a mile away. We got a room for three for 120 rupees. We lay in the room for about half an hour before getting a rickshaw to Central Railway Station to try and book tickets for the next week. The station booking hall was an amazing place. There were hundreds of Indians trying to book tickets at the desks at the main part of the booking hall and a nice little office with chairs round the back for tourists.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were there for about an hour, first of all booking sleepers out of Madras for tomorrow night on the train to Ooty. We had a few problems booking our tickets from Ooty for four days time but after about half an hour, we had an alternative route suggested to us so everything worked out quite well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the booking office at 11:45 and went to the station cafe for lunch. While at the station we booked ourselves onto a city sight-seeing tour and then went back to the hotel for a couple of hours sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for tea at a restaurant just round the corner from the hotel. The meal was superb. We had starters, curries, naan, etc for about 40p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After our meal, we spent about half an hour walking round the area surrounding the hotel. When we were nearly back at the hotel, we were offered grass by a bloke called John. He took me off on his bike to his house and gave me a sample to go and try. After consulting Dave and Roz, we didn't want to buy anything from him because it seemed expensive and I didn't know if I could trust John. I went and told him and he insisted I kept the free sample (about £15 worth in The Bondi Hotel). I told him I would see him again tomorrow night.

                We had breakfast at the same place we had eaten at last night and then got a tuk-tuk to Central Railway Station. We had a two and a half hour wait for our tour to start. We all made trips to the post office and then I went in search of a bank that changed travelers cheques. This involved getting a cycle rickshaw to the bank and wait outside as I had no money to pay him and then take me back again. A good 15 rupees worth!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left our luggage at the station cloakroom, had lunch and then waited for our tour to start. The tour lasted from 2 until just after 6. Most of the palces we went were pretty boring but it was quite good being driven round the city for the afternoon.

                We were dropped in Mt Road, so we went to a restaurant from the book for tea. We caught a tuk-tuk back to Central Station, collected our rucksacks and went to wait for the 9pm train to Mettupalayam. We were on the platform by 8 and the train pulled into the station about 20 minutes later. Our names were on a list pasted to the outside of our carriage, an amazing feat considering the chaos of the booking hall!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bunks were pretty comfortable and the train quite cool so we all had a good nights sleep!

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 6th September</span>
                We arrived in Mettupalayam at 7:20 and transfered to the 1m guage train to take us to Ooty. This train was pushed by a steam engine with a central cog for getting up steep hills. The journey was quite scenic though not as good as the book had led us to believe, and was pretty slow. The 40km to Ooty took over four hours so we didn't arrive until 12:15.

                We went round a few hotels before taking a room at the first place we had looked at for 60 rupees a night. We walked into the Charing Cross area of Ooty and had an all you can eat thali meal. We were given large plates were waited on for half an hour by about a dozen waiters who kept filling up our various curry dishes and bringing more rice, popadoms, etc. We walked back to the hotel via various sweet and cake shops and went to sleep for the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had all woken up, it was tea time so we walked back to the same area where we had lunch and went to a different restaurant. This one had a uniformed doorman who saluted us as we entered, the usual selection of waiters and the meal still only came to about 50p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were offered grass again on the way back to the hotel. This time, the bloke who tried to sell  us the grass took us to a cafe and gave us a joint before telling us to come back tomorrow if we wanted to buy any. We walked back to the hotel and started smoking John's free sample and all got stoned for the first time since March.

                We got up at 10 and at 11, Dave and I went to score. The deal seemed a lot better and safer than the one we had been offered in Madras and we were buying a much smaller quantity. After buying about £1.50 worth, we went for lunch at the same place as yesterday. We went back to the hotel for a couple of hours and then walked down to the lake and hired a peddle boat for an hour. The lake was full of Indian tourists who seem to like holidaying in Ooty. 
            </p>

                We walked back to the hotel for our afternoon sleep before going out for tea. Just before we left the room, an Indian bloke who had seem us in the cafe last night came and asked us for rolling papers. We were all concerned as we hadn't told anyone where we were staying so after a lot of thought, we decided to throw the grass away as opposed to risk getting caught with it in our room. All the evidence destroyed, we went out to the same restaurant as last night.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th September</span>
                We got up, packed and checked out of the hotel by 11, left our rucksacks at reception and went off into town again. We bought food for our train journeys later in the day - a healthy combination of Bombay Mix, bananas and Smarties and then went for yet another thali lunch. We bought a box of cakes before getting a tuk-tuk back to the station, collecting our bags and then waiting for the 2:55 train to Mettupalayam. Ooty has been quite a good place to stay for a couple of days although all we seemed to do was eat and sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We boarded the train at 2, it left on time and arrived three and a half hours later. At Mettupalayam we boarded the Nilgiri Express for the second time, this time heading back towards Madras. This was potentially the worst journey of the day as we were traveling 2nd class unreserved for about three and a half hours. The journey was however, much better than expected and we had seats all the way. We arrived at Erode at 10:25 and then had a three and a half hour wait for our train to Trivandrum.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 9th September</span>
                The train arrived on time at 1:25am - we boarded and departed at 1:30. We only had two sleeping births reserved but managed to pay for a third one on the train. We had the customary argument about who was having which bunk and got to bed by 1:45.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I woke quite early to find that most of our compartment was empty. Although the train was full, we had six seats in the ladies compartment to ourselves fo rnearly all of the remainder of the trip to Trivandrum. We arrived in Trivandrum just after midday and, together with a Scottish bloke we picked up at the station, piled into a tuk-tuk for the ten mile drive to Kovalam. The journey was quite eventful. Just outside Trivandrum we collided with a moped that was trying to overtake us on the inside. There was much standing around discussing the situation before we were on our way again.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At Kovalam we were taken to The Raj Hotel which seemed such good value that we didn't bother going to look at any others. We got a double room (for three) with a bathroom for £1.50 a night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The beach itself, a two minute walk from the hotel is probably the best we have been to yet. There are plenty of restaurants and shops yet it is not over commercialised or too touristy.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had curry fir lunch, walked all the way along the beach and then returned to the room for a couple of hours sleep. We left it quite late in the afternoon before we decided to do any sun-bathing and then only spent about an hour on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went to one of the many restaurants on the beach. All of the restaurants are pretty good but the food seems to take at least an hour to be served. Despite the wait, an excellent meal.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 10th September</span>
                After breakfast, we had to go into Trivandrum to reserve train tickets for next week (we had decided to stay at Kovalam until next Monday). We caught the bus into Trivandrum and then walked to the railway station. Unlike the bug city stations, there is no special tourist ticket office at Trivandrum so we had to join the queue of Indians. We joined the queue at 12:15 and eventually got our tickets at 3:30. We started walking back to the bus station but got diverted by a sign advertising foreign liquor. We found the bottle shop which sold not a lot other than brandy.

                We purchased three bottles of various different qualities and then decided to have a drink at the bar at one side of the shop. The bar also sold nothing but brandy so we had three with lemonade. We were sitting in an incredibly grotty room containing nothing but tables and chairs and an occasional rat, but the brandy tasted quite good. We had another, which led to another and eventually, a major session developed. We gave up on the idea of going back by bus and carried on drinking. I don't remember anything after leaving the bar but apparently we got a tuk-tuk back to Kovalam, went for a meal and then staggered back to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 11th to Sunday 16th September</span>
                The week passed pretty quickly. We didn't do a lot apart from lie in the room, lie on the beach or sit in restaurants eating curries.

                Tuesday was spent largely in the room due to hangovers. When we did decide to go out, we went round the souvenir shops looking for presents for everyone. After about two hours and ten shops, we returned with ten wooden elephants.

                On Wednesday, I managed to sell the cassette player that I had bought in Perth last April. Someone came to our room offering to change money or sell us dope and when he saw the cassette player, said he would buy it from me. I managed to get £15 for it - I would happily have accepted £10 - and we also changed $100 (1900 rupees instead of 1745)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another session on Thursday night. We took two of our bottles of brandy to a restaurant and drank them with our meal. We then paid a 30p deposit and took our glasses back to the room and drank the third bottle. I don't remember going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">On Friday, we had bad hangovers. Apart from going to breakfast (where we managed to buy a 10g lump of hash for £6) and a trip to the post office that half killed me, we hardly left the room all day.

                We got up at 6, left the hotel at 6:15 and went for breakfast by 6:30. We walked along the beach to the bus station (passing hundreds of jelly fish that had been washed up overnight) and caught the 7:30 bus to Quillon. We managed to hit two other buses along the way but arrived in Quillon at about 10.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At Quillon, we boarded a boat for the eight and a half hour backwater trip to Alleppey. The boat trip was pretty good, passing through fishing villages and islands and the sunset was also spectacular. Not quite the highlight of our visit to Kerala as the book suggests but not a bad way of spending a day

We had a one and a half hour bus ride to Emakelum where we got a tuk-tuk out to the town railway station and sat waiting for the 4:45 train to Bangalore. This was the train we had reserved last Monday in Trivandrum so we all had sleeping berths.

                At Bangalore station, for our overnight trip to Goa on Friday. We had expected to find the same sort of chaos that we had in Trivandrum booking hall, but instead found a separate queue for tourists and went straight to the front. According to the lists that were up, there were no sleepers left on the train we wanted to go on but they had a tourist quota so we booked our births and were out of the station by 7:20.

                We crossed over to the bus station and found a direct non-stop bus to Mysore. We had "seats" in the drivers compartment for the three hour journey and arrived in Mysore at 11. We spent about half an hour looking at rooms before settling on a room for 85 rupees with a bathroom and a balcony that overlooks Ghandi Square and the traffic jams in the street below.

                We went out for a thali lunch and then spent a couple of hours walking round the souvenir shops, Mysore being the handicrafts centre of Southern India. The only things we bought were 6 rupees worth of joss sticks and we returned to the hotel at 3:30. Fifteen minutes later , we set off to climb Chamundi Hill. We got a tuk-tuk to the base and then climbed just over 1000 steps to get to the top. We were shown around the temple by a guide who told us it was free but then trip to charge us over £1. After and argument that nearly involved the police, we gave him 60p and set off to look at more shops. As Roz's legs were tired, we caught the bus back down to Mysore instead of  walking.

                Dave woke up feeling ill after being sick twice during the night so we canceled our planned excursion to Somanathapura.

                Roz and I went sight-seeing to the Mah Raja's palace in the morning. We accidentally went to the museum first of all - a total waste of time and 2 rupees and then managed to find our way into the palace itself. The palace was reasonably interesting to walk around though I was more impressed with the elephants outside.

                After a late lunch, we sat around the room for a couple of hours and then the three of us went round the souvenir shops again mainly buying wooden boxes. In the evening I ate meat for the first time in India.

                We had breakfast at about 9 then Roz and I spent nearly an hour haggling over the price of a table she wanted to buy. She eventually got it for Rp1,060. We returned to the hotel, packed up all our stuff and checked out by 11:30. We got a tuk-tuk to the bus station where we got a non-stop bus to Bangalore.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Bangalore, we had about three hours to kill before our train departed, so we got a tuk-tuk to the British Library. Here we found English newspapers so we spent an hour and a half reading about the first month of the football season. It was the first time we had seen any results since the season started.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had tea, went back to the station and got on the 17:10 train to Vasco Da Gamma. We were originally given births in the two tier sleeper compartment (not as good as usual) but managed to get transferred to the three tier after the first stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent the evening playing cards and eating biscuits.

                We arrived in Margoa just after midday and got a tuk-tuk for the 10km to Colva Beach. We got dropped near a cafe so Dave waited there while Roz and I went round looking for a place to stay for the next week. We saw a few places before settling on the Colmar Hotel. Here we were offered a two floor apartment type thing with a decent bathroom for 100 rupees a night. We went back to collect Dave and the rucksacks and moved in. The hotel is excellently situated, less than 100m from the beach with a superb sea view from the upstairs window.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By this time it was about 3:30. We went out for lunch and then a walk along the beach. The beach here is not as good as at Kovalam, though it is still one of the best I have been to. Unfortunately, all of the beach cafes (one of Colva's major attractions) haev been closed down by the health department but there seems to be quite a good selection of other restaurants and and they all serve cheap beer!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a meal in our hotel restaurant for tea as none of us had the energy to walk any further.

                A lazy day. Roz and I spent too long on the beach and both ended up with sun-burn. Dave is still recovering from the effects of his illness in Mysore.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the evening, we decided we had better sort out our travel plans for when we leave here so we can book train tickets. We eventually settled on staying in Goa an extra four or five days , either at Colva or another beach, missing out on Bombay and the Ajanta Caves, and then getting a train direct to Agra. where we hope to arrive in two weeks time. We will stay there for two nights and then go to Delhi to try and book flights home.

                We got up early, had breakfast and caught the 8 o'clock bus into Margoa. We had no problems booking three sleepers on the train to Delhi on Oct 4th and even managed to get on a train that was six hours quicker than expected. Next we caught a bus to Panaji, an hour and a half journey, where we had to collect mail from the G.P.O. and change money. After we had eaten lunch, we got another bus back to Margoa. During this journey, we had our fourth accident since getting to India when a small boy ran out into the road. He wasn't badly injured but the bus had to stay where it was so we had to get on another. Back at Margoa we got on our sixth bus of the day back to Colva where we arrived at 4:30 hot and worn out.

                Roz and I wen tinto Margoa in the morning intending to phone home. After walking round in circles for half an hour we found the telegraph office which was about 20m from where we had got off the bus. The telegraph office was total chaos and it cost £6 for a three minute phone call. We decided not to bother. We had a quick look around the shops and then got the bus back to Colva.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon and also went round the shops of Colva. They aren't as good as the ones in Kovalam but I did manage to find a new bag. (my rucksack is half full of Roz's table!)

                After breakfast, we hired bikes and cycled into Margoa. We posted letters and Roz bought a stool she wanted and we returned to Colva.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of hours rest and then cycled along the beach to a cafe near Benaulim for lunch. We decided that after all our exercise we deserved a beer with our meal and this led to us spending the afternoon drinking. We cycled back to Colva and returned the bikes at 6ish and continued drinking in the room until the electricity went off at 7.

                We went out for tea and had to eat our meal by candle-light as the whole of Colva was in darkness. We had a few more beers and went back to the room again. The power still had not come on so we had a couple of joints and went to bed.

                Another cloudy day so, again, we didn't do a lot. Roz phoned home in the afternoon and got her parents to phone Llansteffan and give Mum our phone number here. She phoned back twice, both times we were cut off after a minute. Jane should be getting home a couple of weeks before me, but apart from finding that out, we didn't get a chance to say much.

                We decided to have our "leaving Goa" session today so we don't have hangovers on Thursday. We started to drink the brandy in our room and went out at 4 to continue drinking..... only to discover that today is a dry day due to it being Ghandi's birthday or something. We found one restaurant that could get us beer in an hour so we ordered six bottles and went to lunch. We went to pick up the bottles, ordered six more for two hours time and smuggled them back to the room.

                Dave and I went to Panaji in the morning to check for mail and to change money. It proved to be a wasted trip. There were no letters for any of us and we had to spend over an hour in the bank. The round trip took six hours, involved six buses including a major detour via Panda and Old Goa and we finally arrived back in Colva at 3.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out to lunch and then got stoned for the last time, packed our bags and checked out of the hotel. We walked to a restaurant for a final prawn curry and then got a taxi into Margoa railway station where we sat down to wait for the 9pm train to Delhi. The train left roughly on time.

                We had a pretty good day on the train. The couple who were sharing the eight seats we had between us spent most of the day on the two seats across the aisle from us, leaving us with six seats and the two upper bunks to ourselves. The day passed quite quickly, mainly spent reading and sleeping. In the evening, Roz and I had one of the best value meals we have had since getting to India. For 10 rupees we had vegetable curry, rice, dahl, puris and raita.

                We arrived in Agra at midday and were immedeatly surrounded by auto-rickshaw drivers wanting to take us to a hotel. We went and sat in one of the rickshaws and after the two drivers had argued about who was taking us, we proceeded to th Tourist Rest House. This was full so we checked into a hotel just down the road.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers, we went out for lunch and then wandered round the souvenir shops. We got a tuk-tuk to The Taj Mahal stopping at a craft shop on the way. All the rickshaw drivers get 5 rupees if they take you to any craft shop. This means the journeys are cheap but can take a long time!

                The Taj Mahal was impressive, or "marbleous" as Dave would repeatedly say! We spent about half an hour wandering round, taking photos, etc and then another half an hour lying down in the shade round the back.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We wandered round more souvenir shops and then got rickshaws back to the hotel. This journey took over an hour as we were taken to yet more craft shops. The rickshaw drivers came back to pick us up at 7:30 and took us to a restaurant. We had a rickshaw each this time as each driver gets cheap meals for taking tourists to particular places.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a few problems finding accommodation as most of Delhi is booked out for a conference or something but we eventually found a room for 170 rupees. The room is not bad but the area it is in is pretty grotty and out of the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After dumping our luggage, we got another rickshaw to Connaught Place and went in search of travel agencies so we could book our flights home. The first place we went to was incredibly efficient and told us straight away that we could have tickets for £174 flying LOT (Polish Airlines) on Fri 26th October. We told then we would take the tickets and went off in various different directions to try and get enough money together to pay for them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We met up at the travel agent at 2:30 and paid for the tickets in cash. We then had the problems of our encashment certificates. We had to produce Rp10,045 worth of certificates each (the published price of the tickets) despite the fact that we were only paying Rp5,800 each. We just about had enough certificates to cover ourselves but two had not been stamped by the bank when we had originally changed the money. This meant that we had to go to the Reserve Bank with our passports and certificates to get a letter signed and stamped to authorise the travel agency to issue the tickets. the whole system is totally ridiculous and the situation in the Reserve Bank was quite incredible. We first of all had to get passes to enter the main part of the building and then spent half an hour or so being passed back and fore around various different departments trying to find someone to authorise our forms. After about 45 minutes, Roz and I left Dave to sort it out (it took him another half an hour) and went to the railway station to book tickets to Calcutta for tomorrow. We couldn't get tickets for tomorrow so reserved berths for Wednesday morning instead.

                We booked ourselves onto a "Delhi by Evening" tour for 6pm and then Roz and I spent a couple of hours going round the shops while Dave went to the National History Museum. We met up again for tea and then walked to the tourist office to start the tour. The first part of the tour was pretty boring driving past various buildings, monuments, etc. We then had an hour at Appu Ghar which was much better. Supposedly, the Indian Disneyland it consisted of a lot of rides that looked as if they may have come from a British fairground thirty years ago.

                We got up at 6:30 and got a rickshaw to Old Delhi Station. We had booked sleeping berths on the 8am train to Calcutta and arrived at the station an hour before it left. When we found the train, it was totally packed out with people who had been attending the communist rally in Delhi and were returning home. It was impossible to get into our carriage let alone claim our sleeping berths. We went to see the station master who said there was nothing he could do because of the number of people on the train but told us we could get a refund and suggested that we go to Agra instead!

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the train in the hope that we could get on it somehow - we had no desire to stay in Delhi. We got onto an air-con sleeper and sat down. We got moved about a couple of times and had a pretty uncomfortable day but we managed to stay in the carriage until Varanasi. The guard had told us that we could claim our births here so we got off the train only to find that nothing had changed and we still couldn't get into our carriage. We asked a T.T.E. (Traveling Ticket Examiner) what to do. He said get into any carriage so we went back to where we had spent most of the day. By this time (11pm) all the beds had been made up and the only way we could stay in the carriage was to lie on the floor under the seats.

                We got woken by a new conductor at 2am who said we could get out at the next station or pay Rp2,300 to stay in air-con. We argued that it wasn't our fault, Roz took his name to make a complaint and an Indian joined in the discussion backing us up and eventually he said we could sleep in the space by the doors and toilet. Roz and I were given a sheet and a pillow for the night and we eventually got to sleep again by about 3.

We walked from the railway station to the booking office, about 2km away and booked tickets to get to Darjeeling, leaving Calcutta on Saturday. We went from there to the Home Political departmetn to obtain permits to visit Darjeeling only to be told that, since August, they are not required.

                We caught a taxi to the area where most of the accomodation is located and, after trying the Y.M.C.A. walked to The Fairlawn Hotel. This hotel was highly recommended by the book as being the one place in India to really splash out on. It is run by an old English couple and apparently has hardly changed since the days of the Raj. A room for three of us cost £45 including all meals and afternoon tea (and tea bought to the room at 6:30am).

                Dinner was served at 8pm. We had to wait for the waiter to bang the gong before enetering the dining room. We were served a four course meal by about ten white-gloved waiters. Every time a course was finished, our plates were whisked away to be replaced by the next course in seconds. After coffee, we returned to the room and had an early night.

                The food today was superb. Melon, porridge, toast, eggs, bananas and tea for breakfast, fish and salad, curry, rice dahl and poppadoms for lunch and in the evening, soup, roast pork with all the trimmings followed by swiss roll and custard.

                Our tour started at 8am so we had a quick breakfast and got a taxi to the tourist office. The first part of the tour was the usual drive round with the sights being pointed out as we drove past them. The first stop was at a pretty uninteresting temple. Not long after that, our bus hit a traffic jam. After about an hour of not moving, Roz who was suffering from a cold had had enough and got a taxi back to the hotel. In the hour following Roz's departure, we didn't move at all so Dave and I, not wanting to miss  out on our last meal at Fairlawns, decided to knock the trip on the head and caught a bus back into Calcutta.

                We arrived at 9 and, after registering at the foreign visitors office, we caught an auto-rickshaw into Siliguri, the nearest town. We went straight to the railway reservation office and booked tickets to Varanasi for next Thursday night and went by cycle rickshaw to the Darjeeling bus station. The bus station was totally chaotic. There were plenty of buses but no-one seemed to know where we should y tickets and we were told by one information desk that all buses to Darjeeling were full. We joined a queue with a load of other people trying to get to Darjeeling though it didn't seem to move in the time we stood there. After a while, we were approached by someone offering a taxi ride all the way there for Rp50 each. We followed him to the car and were joined in it by the driver, four Indians plus one baby. By this time it was 11am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had gone about 10km out of Siliguri when we pulled into a petrol station only to find it was closed. We didn't have enough petrol to get all the way so we went back to where we had started from and got into another taxi. We left Siliguri for the second time at midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey up was quite scenic following the railway line all the way. As we got nearer Darjeeling, the weather deteriorated and by the time we got there at 4pm it was pouring with rain, cold, dark and gloomy. The journey took longer than expected due to traffic jams and landslides, which were also responsible for the train not running any more as large sections of the track had been washed away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We stood in a half-built shop waiting for the rain to stop for about 20 minutes before someone came up to us and said we could stay at his hotel for Rp100. I went off to look at the room which was pretty poor. We took it anyway as Roz's clod was getting worse and it seemed a better alternative to waiting in the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We borrowed an umbrella to go out for tea but got soaked anyway and we were all back in the hotel and in bed by 9.

                The weather was much better today and Darjeeling seemed a much better place than when we had arrived. On our way to breakfast, we called in at The Bellevue Hotel to see the price of rooms there. We were shown a room that was infinitely better than where we had stayed last night with a hot shower and we were asked how much we wanted to pay. We settled on Rp250, went out for breakfast and then moved all our stuff to the new hotel.

                After breakfast, we walked the 2km out to the zoo and Himalayan Mountain Institute. The zoo was pretty boring but the H. M. I. had the only interesting museum we have been to so far with plenty of photos, info, etc about Everest expeditions , other mountains in the region and a section on the abominable snowman.

                We walked from the H.M.I. to the Happy Valley Tea Plantation and were shown round the factory. It was similar to the one in Sri Lanka but was more interesting as tea was being processed while we were there.

                We walked back to Darjeeling by which time none of us were 100% well. Dave was sick on the way back, Roz was to throw up a couple of hours later and I had to have 23 visits to the toilet in 48 hours. We spent the evening lying in our beds only eating cream crackers.

                We left the hotel shortly after 7 and went for breakfast. We walked to the taxi stand and found a taxi just about to leave that would take us to Siliguri for Rp60 each. The journey down the hill took about half the time of the trip up to Darjeeling and we arrived in Siliguri by 11:30.

                The train was supposed to arrive in Varanasi at 8:30am. At 6:30 we were at a station totally off the route that we had supposed to have been on and still four hours from Patna where we should have been at 4:30. This meant that we were running approximately seven hours late!

                We eventually got to Moghulsari at 5pm and got a taxi with an English couple to Clarks Hotel in Varanasi. We had decided that as it was our last week, we would stay somewhere a bit more expensive than usual. The Clarks Hotel was a bit too expensive at £60 a night but The Ashok next door, still an international class hotel, was only £45 so we checked in. We were all filthy after the train journey and the scruffiest people in the hotel by a long way. We were asked if we were aware of the prices before we booked in. The manager also asked us if our luggage was outside - "What luggage??"

                We had booked tickets yesterday morning for a morning tour of Varanasi starting at 6am. We got up at 5:30 and walked to the tourist office to catch the bus. The first stop was at the River Ganges where we had an hour long boat trip past the bathing ghats where all the Hindus come to wash every day.

The bill for our four days, including most of our meals, room service, etc came to about £60 each, less than we'd expected.

                I have no idea why the diary just finished at that point or what we did on the final night of the trip. I don't know if we went out and got drunk or just had a meal and an early night. It was obviously not a particularly memorable evening so probably not a big session. Also obviously not a particularly interesting night out as I couldn't be bothered to write about it!
