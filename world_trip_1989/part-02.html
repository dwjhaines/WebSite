                Woke up at 6 after a night of frequently interrupted sleep. We boarded the plane at 8:20, took off at 9:10 and landed at Honolulu at 12:30 local time. We hired a car to drive to Waikiki as it was not much more expensive than the bus fare. We got a brand new Granada for $45. We spent about an hour looking for accommodation, most places were full due to it being peak season. We eventually found an apartment for $65 a night so we booked in for a week. The apartment has two rooms, a bathroom and kitchen and is about 100 yards from Waikiki Beach. We left our luggage at the apartment and spent a couple of hours driving around the island, making the most of the car.It rained most of the time we were away but it had cleared up by the time we returned to Waikiki.

                We spent the evening walking along the beach and around the gift shops and markets and then had an early night.

                In the morning we drove around to the other side of the island and saw some of the smaller, less crowded beaches. Paul and Ed took the car back to the airport while Dave and I had our first couple of hours on Waikiki Beach. The beach was pretty crowded but quite nice anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The evening was pretty much the same as yesterdays. We can not afford to go out at night either to eat or drink. We are cooking all our own meals to save money but at the moment are eating quite well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 6th to Friday, 10th February</span>
                Every day has been pretty much the same. We wait until about 1:30 before going to the beach and then spend about three hours sun-bathing. We eat at 5:30 - 6:00 and spend the evening reading or playing cards. Although it is repetitive, we have not got bored of it yet and are quite enjoying the relaxation. The weather has been quite good most of the time but we have had a few showers of rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We are still doing our own cooking and are surviving on spaghetti, brown rice and pineapples.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have decided to rent the apartment for another week. Although it is quite expensive, it is so convenient, we thought it was worth the money.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th February</span>
                It rained for most of the day so we stayed in playing cards and getting drunk. We got through a bottle of Southern Comfort, a bottle of Jim Beam, 1.5 litres of wine and about half a Thai stick that we had managed to buy during the week.

                The week passed mainly in the same way as last week with a few exceptions. On Monday we went to Honolulu Zoo where most of the animals appeared to be dead or asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On Tuesday night we went to a few bars where they served cheap Mai Tais during happy hours and ended up in The Jazz Cellar watching a heavy metal band. We all ended up pretty pissed.

                Thursday morning, I phoned home.

                We had to leave the apartment by 12 noon. We could not keep it for another week as Ed and Paul are going to Big Island next week, so we went out and checked into Waikiki Youth Hostel where we had already reserved places. We spent most of the day sun-bathing in a park near the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we met Chris and Liz who are also in the hostel on their way home from Australia - Small World! We went out with them to an English bar called The Rose and Crown for a few beers.

                We tried to hire a jeep so that we could go to a different beach for the day but they were too expensive so we ended up in our usual spot. In the evening, we went out for a "Spaghetti and All You Can Eat Salad" with Chris and Liz.

                Paul and Ed left aat 8:30 to go to Big Island. Dave and I spent the day lying in parks or on the beach. We visited the aquarium which was a waste of $2.50. In the evening we visited Seagulls, a bar just round the corner from the hostel and discovered the cheapest beer since we left home. We got totally slammed and neither of us remember leaving. Apparently, I went to bed at about 3 or 4am.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st February</span>
                We went to the Ala Moana shopping centre in the morning and bought The Sunday Times. I collected my first set of photos, most of which I was pleased with. It rained quite a bit and I didn't feel much like sunbathing so we seemed to spend most of the day sitting in a McDonalds.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd February</span>
                Me and Dave had to vacate the youth hostel today as we had already overstayed our three night limit. As we had no-where to sleep, we decided to hire a car for 24 hours and spend the night in it. We picked up an old Sentra at 9:30 at a cost of $26. We drove first to Pearl Harbour where we saw the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We then visited the flea market at Aloha Stadium. It sold the same things as all the tourist shops in Waikiki but most items were a lot cheaper. I bought three t-shirts. The weather was pretty bad for most of the day so we killed time by driving around the island again. In the evening, we went to a Vietnamese restaurant in Honolulu's China Town and both ate our meals with chopsticks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We parked the car near the university and after looking around the campus, went to sleep at about 9:00.

                We woke at about 7:30 and drove back to the hostel stopping for breakfast on the way. We picked up Chris and Liz after we had checked in as they were moving to the other Honolulu hostel. After returning the car, we went by bus to Kailua Beach on the North side of the island. The weather was not too good up there so we returned to Waikiki about an hour later. Spent the afternoon on Waikiki beach and I had a go on a surfboard without much success.

                Me adn Dave spent the morning walking round second hand bookshops getting rid of our collection. Sunbathed in the park in the afternoon. In the evening, we went to Seagulls with Chris and Liz who are leaving first thing tomorrow.

                Paul and Ed reappeared at about 3. We spent all day lying in the beach or in the park. In the evening we went to the Irish Rose Saloon to watch the Tyson v Bruno fight. After the fight, we went to Seagulls. None of us really felt like having a session so we just had a few beers and returned to the hostel.

                Our last day in Hawaii. Ed went off to Pearl Harbour for the day while Dave, Paul and myself walked up to the top of Diamond Head Crater. The walk took about three hours but it was well worth it as the views of Honolulu were superb.

                We spent the afternoon lying in the park making the most of our last day in the sun. We went out for a spaghetti and salad in the evening then sat around in the hostel waiting for the airport bus at 10:30.

                We left Honolulu at 2:30am, one hour late. Most of Monday disappeared when we crossed the date line.
