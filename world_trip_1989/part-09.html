                Me, Paul, Jane and Liz went to The Coogee Bay Hotel in the evening to buy grass for the weekend. We all got stoned when we got back and finally got to bed at about 2.

                I started doing my market research at 9:30 and finished abotu a minute later. I was not keen on the idea to start with and by the time I had reached the area I was working, i was hot and fed up with the whole thing. In the first house I went to, I was totally ignored after I had said I was a market research interviewer. At this point I decided I did not want to do the job anymore and went home.

                I went into Darling Harbour at about 8:30 to try and find a job. I gave up after about ten minutes and decided to do my Christmas shopping instead. This was also unsuccessful as I only managed to buy a book for myself and then spent the rest of the day in the pub. I met Paul in The Paddington Inn and we were joined there by Ed. We stayed there for a couple of hours before returning to Bondi via The Tea Gardens at Bondi Junction. We went to Coogee for about an hour in the evening and then, after getting stoned went back to Bondi Junction. We spent the evening watching a band at The Grand and then Paul, Ed and I went to a night club for about half an hour. We all ended up back at Bondi, pissed out of our minds sometime between midnight and 2am.

                After work, I went for an interview at West Lane Cove with a furniture removal company. The work is on Friday evenings, Saturday and Sunday and I have to phone in every Thursday to find out if there is work for that weekend. The hours are not ideal but I need the money ($9 per hour).

                I bought home tools from work and started repairing the car. Quite a lot needs to be done before we can sell it and I want to do as much as possible myself to save money. I started by taking the carburetter apart to replace the gaskets.

                I met Julie (from Clyne and Freo) at the bus stop after work. Apart from that, it was a pretty uneventful day. I discovered that I will be working on Saturday and possibly tomorrow and Sunday as well.

                A boring morning at work but at about 1pm, I discovered a party going on in another department. I spent the next three hours getting totally legless and don't remember leaving work or traveling home. Fell asleep at about 7:30.

                I was supposed to start work at 7 but couldn't be bothered to get up. I reassembled the carburetter and then went Christmas shopping with Paul and Ed. We spent about an hour looking round the shops and then went to The Centrepoint Tavern and a caouple of pubs in Kings Cross. In the evening, we went to The Bondi HOtel but got bored so went home quite early.

                My last day at work before Christmas. Roz and I went to the airport to meet Regan and Gary who were due to arrive at 9:40pm. We waited about an hour and a half at the airport before finding out that the flight was canceled and they wont get here until tomorrow afternoon.

                Earlier, we had called the Australian version of the R.A.C. out to try and get the car going. He told me I had put the carby back together wrongly which was why it wouldn't start! The car is now running but not very well and needs to go into a garage fro repairs before we sell it. We went to the airport by bus/train, a four and a half hour round trip.

                In the afternoon, we went to the airport again. Regan and Gary finally turned up at 5 o'clock - 20 hours late. We ahd already started drinking by the time they arrived and we didn't really stop for the next four days!

                When we got back to Bondi, we all went out for the meal and then stayed all night in The Bondi Hotel. The pub stayed open 24 hours a day in the week leading up to Christmas. There are large parts of the night that I don't remember but me and Gary finally got back to the flat at about 7am after going paddling in the sea. We then spent about an hour taking photos outside the house before me, Roz and Gary went to Bondi Junction again.

At about 3 we decided to go back to the beach for a walk (except Ed, Dave and Linda who were already unconscious). We ended up going skinny dipping which was good fun. We went back to the house where me and Gary spent the rest of the night having boiled egg and pickled onion eating contests. We were still awake at 6:30 so decided to walk to Bondi Junction and back for a McDonalds. I finally got to bed at about 8:30.

                I was awake at 11 and after a couple of hours of not knowing what to do with ourselves, me and Dave decided to go to the pub to buy a case of beer. We called in for a drink and ended up staying there for fourteen hours. We were joined during the afternoon by the rest of our flat members and had quite a good night although parts of it are a bit vague in my memory.

Dave who had had a few beers last night was woken by the tremor and got up to see who was at the door. Newcastle about 80km N.W. of Sydney was worst hit with several deaths, injuries, etc.

He then drove us both back to Bondi and joined us for an afternoon session at The Bondi Hotel. We left the pub at about 7:30 and went back to the house and got stoned for the rest of the night.

I can vaguely remember someone giving me some mushrooms just after midnight. These made the evening quite interesting. We all left the pub at about 2am and carried on drinking and smoking in the house. Ed and I went swimming at about 6:30 and I eventually got to bed at about 8.

                I have decided that when I leave Australia at the start of March, I am going to go to New Zealand for aobut four months. If I can get a few months work out there, it will give me more money to travel home with and it will mean missing the worst of the weather in Asia. It will also mean that I will be in a civilised country for the World Cup in June. At the moment, Roz and Dave seem keen on going as well but everyone else will probably go straight back via various stops in Asia.

                We woke at about 10 and went straight to the pub. Roz, Linda, Dave, Gary and I decided to have an all day session despite the fact that Gary and Regan were catching the 6:30 bus to Brisbane. After we had been in the pub a few hours, Regan who was getting in a panic about everything left his rucksack and went into the city to get his plane tickets changed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arranged to meet him again at Central Station at 4pm, but due to being delayed in a couple of pubs on the way, we failed to get there until 5:30. By this time, Regan had got in a taxi and was looking for us in Bondi. We all went to the bus station at about 6:15 and Regan eventually turned up, dripping with sweat at 6:26, four minutes before the bus was due to depart. The bus was delayed for ten minutes while they sorted out their tickets and we all had our photos taken sitting in the luggage department, drivers seat, etc. When they had finally left, we got a taxi to Paddington and went for a pizza. I managed to lose my camera in the taxi on the way. We were well drunk by the time we got back to Bondi but still managed to stay in teh pub until about 5.
