                Me, Paul, Jane and Liz went to The Coogee Bay Hotel in the evening to buy grass for the weekend. We all got stoned when we got back and finally got to bed at about 2.

                I started doing my market research at 9:30 and finished abotu a minute later. I was not keen on the idea to start with and by the time I had reached the area I was working, i was hot and fed up with the whole thing. In the first house I went to, I was totally ignored after I had said I was a market research interviewer. At this point I decided I did not want to do the job anymore and went home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a meal at The Thai Flora in the evening.

                I felt tired and hungover all day even though I didn't drink much yesterday. I went to bed at about 6:30.

                I went into Darling Harbour at about 8:30 to try and find a job. I gave up after about ten minutes and decided to do my Christmas shopping instead. This was also unsuccessful as I only managed to buy a book for myself and then spent the rest of the day in the pub. I met Paul in The Paddington Inn and we were joined there by Ed. We stayed there for a couple of hours before returning to Bondi via The Tea Gardens at Bondi Junction. We went to Coogee for about an hour in the evening and then, after getting stoned went back to Bondi Junction. We spent the evening watching a band at The Grand and then Paul, Ed and I went to a night club for about half an hour. We all ended up back at Bondi, pissed out of our minds sometime between midnight and 2am.

                After work, I went for an interview at West Lane Cove with a furniture removal company. The work is on Friday evenings, Saturday and Sunday and I have to phone in every Thursday to find out if there is work for that weekend. The hours are not ideal but I need the money ($9 per hour).

                I bought home tools from work and started repairing the car. Quite a lot needs to be done before we can sell it and I want to do as much as possible myself to save money. I started by taking the carburetter apart to replace the gaskets.

                I met Julie (from Clyne and Freo) at the bus stop after work. Apart from that, it was a pretty uneventful day. I discovered that I will be working on Saturday and possibly tomorrow and Sunday as well.

                A boring morning at work but at about 1pm, I discovered a party going on in another department. I spent the next three hours getting totally legless and don't remember leaving work or traveling home. Fell asleep at about 7:30.

                I was supposed to start work at 7 but couldn't be bothered to get up. I reassembled the carburetter and then went Christmas shopping with Paul and Ed. We spent about an hour looking round the shops and then went to The Centrepoint Tavern and a caouple of pubs in Kings Cross. In the evening, we went to The Bondi HOtel but got bored so went home quite early.

                Roz and Gordon arrived back from New Zealand at lunch time. We went down to the beach at 4 to see the Iron Man Championship. Mos tof it had finished by the time we got there but it didn't look that exciting anyway. In the evening, we went to The Thai Flora for a meal.

                My last day at work before Christmas. Roz and I went to the airport to meet Regan and Gary who were due to arrive at 9:40pm. We waited about an hour and a half at the airport before finding out that the flight was canceled and they wont get here until tomorrow afternoon.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Earlier, we had called the Australian version of the R.A.C. out to try and get the car going. He told me I had put the carby back together wrongly which was why it wouldn't start! The car is now running but not very well and needs to go into a garage fro repairs before we sell it. We went to the airport by bus/train, a four and a half hour round trip.

                I had the day off work as I had expected to have a hangover. In the morning we went up to Bondi Junction and bought food for Christmas Day. We spent about $130.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the afternoon, we went to the airport again. Regan and Gary finally turned up at 5 o'clock - 20 hours late. We ahd already started drinking by the time they arrived and we didn't really stop for the next four days!

                When we got back to Bondi, we all went out for the meal and then stayed all night in The Bondi Hotel. The pub stayed open 24 hours a day in the week leading up to Christmas. There are large parts of the night that I don't remember but me and Gary finally got back to the flat at about 7am after going paddling in the sea. We then spent about an hour taking photos outside the house before me, Roz and Gary went to Bondi Junction again.

                I felt pretty ill all day but recovered sufficiently to stay all night in the pub again. Ten of us went to The Thai Flora for a meal before going to the pub. I got back at about 6:30 this time after a really good night out.

                I had a hangover again. We went to the pub in the evening but didn't drink much. There was a pretty good atmosphere there. Most of the people were English and drunk. I had an early night and went to bed at about midnight.

                Dave turned up at about 2am after hitching the last 700km from Perth. We sat up for about three hours drinking before I returned to bed again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I got up at 10 and we all opened our presents. We had all bought each other a $2 persent as well as getting a couple from home. In the afternoon, we all wen tto the beach where again, there was an excellent atmosphere. We spent about two hours on the beach and I managed to burn my back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We then went back to the house for a meal. We had made a cold salad buffet before going out. We had thought about a traditional Christmas dinner but decided that our kitchen would not cope with cooking for eleven people.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After eating, we went down to the pub again. It was another good night even though the pub closed at 10:00. We went back to the house to continue drinking. At about 3 we decided to go back to the beach for a walk (except Ed, Dave and Linda who were already unconcious). We ended up going skinny dipping which was good fun. We went back to the house where mw and Gary spent the rest of the night having boiled egg and pickled onion eating contests. We were still awake at 6:30 so decided to walk to Bondi Junction and back for a McDonalds. I finally got to bed at about 8:30.
