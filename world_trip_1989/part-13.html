                We arrived in Kuantan at 4am and had to get off the bus. We continued sleeping at the bus station until 6:30 when we caught a bus up the coast to Cherating, a beach resort 45km away. Again, compared to Indonesia, the bus service seemed incredibly efficient, running to a timetable and leaving despite being only half full! We left our rucksacks at The Coconut Inn where someone was about to vacate a chalet and went for breakfast at a cafe just down the road. After breakfast, we walked back and were shown our chalet. It has two beds and a mattress for RM16.50 a night. Again, we are in a really nice place 20m from the beach in an area surrounded by palm trees, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the morning on the beach and then spent an un-successful half hour walking around looking for somewhere that sold cheap beer. We found plenty of bars, all quite expensive so eventually we gave up. Back at the chalet, Dave and Roz fell asleep and I spent the afternoon reading. We went to an Indian restaurant for tea and then went to a bar that was showing The Wall on video.
            </p>

                We had to go into Kuantan to sort out bus tickets and to try and buy cheap alcohol. At the bus stop we started hitching and within about ten minutes were picked up by Hussain, a  journalist from Kuala Lumpa. He seemed keen on "exchanging knowledge" with us and was quite an interesting bloke to talk to. On arrival in Kuantan, he took us all for a meal and insisted that we should go and stay with him when we get to Kuala Lumpa (one night at his first wife's house and one night at his second wife's). He dropped us off in the town centre where we bought tickets for the bus journey up the coast on Monday. We also managed to get three bottles of nasty looking rice wine for about £2 a bottle. We spent most of the next hour looking for a money changer and then caught the 2:30 bus back to Cherating. After a brief swim, we started on the beers, having two cans each to prepare ourselves for the wine.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We drank one bottle before going out for a meal and took one with us to mix with our coke at the restaurant. Roz didn't feel like drinking the wine which was pretty foul and about the same strength as the stuff we had in Ubud. Dave and I finished most of the bottle and, back at the chalet, drank the third bottle while playing cards.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 22nd July</span>
                We woke at 11:30 and went for breakfast immediately followed by lunch at the place we ate last night. Spent most of the day lying on the bed with a hangover. It felt as if we were on a proper holiday again!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the same restaurant as the two previous meals and all had chili beef for the third meal running. Had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 23rd July</span>
                We got up at 7, packed and checked out and caught a bus back to Kuantan. We had breakfast pf pancakes and curry sauce before catching the 10am bus to Rantau Abang. Inevitably, the bus stopped to pick people up at Cherating (we had been told it wouldn't) so we could have saved ourselves a two and a half hour trip back to Kuantan!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Rantau Abang, we were dropped at Dirahmes guest house where we checked into a room for three again. Spent the afternoon on the beach and went for a meal at about 7. We remained at the restaurant until 9:30, firstly while I went back to the room for the right wallet and then playing cards.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The main attraction at Rantau Abang are the giant leatherback turtles that come up onto the beach in the middle of the night to lay their eggs. We were lucky in that there was one on the beach when we came back from our meal so we walked along the beach and joined the hundred or so other tourists crowded around her. It was quite an amazing sight watching her lay over 100 eggs though I felt sorry for the turtle. It can't have been pleasant for her having to lay her eggs in front of all the tourists taking photos and shining torches on her. We left before she returned to the sea and returned to our room for the night.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 24th July</span>
                Got up at 9 and went for breakfast. Dave and I sampled the banana porridge, one of the best breakfasts of the trip so far.It was pretty cloudy all morning so we stayed in the restaurant playing cards until 12:30. We spent a couple of hours on the beach in which time Dave turned a lovely shade of pink.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we had a free bar-b-q at the place we were staying which was excellent. We turned up at 6:30 to be presented with an esky full of fresh tuna to cut up. I had a go at gutting one of them before offering the knofe to a German bloke who proceeded to do the rest of them. We waited about two hours from when we lit the bar-b-q to when we actually ate but when it came, the food was superb especially as it was included in the £1 per night each we were paying for the accommodation! We totally stuffed ourselves and spent the rest of the evening playing cards with another three travelers from U.K.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 25th July</span>
                We left at 9:30 (without having breakfast due to almost totally having run out of cash) and caught a bus to Kuala Tennganu. Her we changed money, had a McDonalds type brunch and then caught another bus to Kota Bharu, a town just South of the Thai border. We arrived at 3pm, checked into a guest house and proceeded straight away to the Thai Consulate which closed at 4. We were there for about half an hour filling out forms, handing in photos, etc. We had to pay RM30 each (about £6) for two month tourist visas. We stopped for much needed drinks on the way back to the hostel and then spent a couple of hours sitting around having more drinks, writing diaries, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out to the night market, supposedly "the best place in Peninsular Malaysia for Malay food". We all had beef pancakes which were pretty good and only cost about 20p each. After a brief walk around the town, which didn't seem to have a lot to offer, we returned to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 26th July</span>
                Spent nearly all day doing nothing. In the morning, we walked into town to change a travelers cheque and at 2pm we went to collect our passports and Thai visas. The rest of the day was spent lying on  our rooms (we were moved to a bigger one in the morning) trying to decide between second and third class for the 18 hour train journey to Kuala Lumpa. Every time we came to a decision, our plans were foiled by a train being full or not running on a certain day. We eventually settled on going third class as far as Kuala Lipis (about a third of the journey) and deciding there whether to continue or to catch a bus the next day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we thought about going to the cinema but ended up stuffing ourselves with sweets while playing cards in our room. We went out to the night market for food again at about 10.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 27th July</span>
                We left the hotel just before 9 and caught a bus to the railway station. We were there about two and a half hours before the train left so we sat in the waiting room reading and mentally preparing ourselves for the journey. When the train did come, it wasn't half as bad as expected. There were plenty of seats, fans on the ceiling and not a chicken in sight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey through the jungle was quite good without being truly spectacular and the time passed pretty quickly. We had a huge downpour during the afternoon which resulted in us getting wet and our compartments floor getting covered in water due to a door that wouldn't shut.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We weren't really sure what we were going to do at Kuala Lipis but the discovery of a buffet car made up our minds and we stayed on the train. At Kuala Lipis, I got off the train and bought tickets all the way through to K.L.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had mie goreng for tea and tried going to sleep at 10. We had a pretty uncomfortable night though I think I managed to sleep for about five hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 28th July</span>
                We arrived in K.L. at 6:30 and, after a lot of confusion, walked to Chinatown where most of the cheap accommodation is located. Half the hotels recommended by Lonely Planet had been knocked down and the rest were full though we eventually got an air-conditioned room at The Colonial Hotel by sitting in the reception until someone checked out. We walked back to the station to change money and to book tickets for sleepers on the overnight train to Penang tomorrow night and then went to McDonalads for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back in the room by 11 and after showering and picking up a new tube of Dactarin, we decided to go in search of "The Brass Rail", a British style pub. We failed to find it but instead found The Bulls Head, a similar establishment. We got there at 12:30 to find that there was a happy hour on Saturdays from 12 - 7.

                We spent the afternoon drinking pints of Carlsberg and I only vaguely remember leaving at 7:30. We wandered round looking for more bars and apparently went for a meal in one of them. None of us remember getting back to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 29th July</span>
                Had a bad hangover. With the exception of a walk to McDonalds, we spent the morning recovering in the room making the most of the air-condtioning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the hotel at 1 and got a taxi to the station where we put our rucksacks in lockers and then spent an hour in A&W stuffing our faces with chicken.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By about 3 we were ready to start our sight-seeing of K.L and headed out in  a bus to Batu Caves. They were pretty boring so after more soft drinks, we caught a bus back again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a really good meal for tea - chicken, bacon and rice all cooked in a clay pot - and then returned to the station to await the 10pm train.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The train was excellent. We all had 2nd class sleeping berths which seemed pretty luxurious after our last train journey.

                We arrived in Butterworth at 6:30 and immediately caught the ferry to Georgetown on the island of Penang, a ten minute journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for breakfast at a cafe and after a bit of a disagreement, went and checked into a hotel around the corner. Roz took her rucksack to be repaired and after more drinks, Dave and I arranged to meet her at the beach and then headed off to Penang Hill. It took two buses to get there and we then got on the funicular railway to take us up the hill. The views at the top would have been really spectacular had it not been so cloudy but as we couldn't see much, we got straight back on the train and returned to the hotel. We caught three buses to get to Batu Ferringhi, the beach where we were to meet Roz and eventually found her at 3pm. We spent an hour on the beach and returned once more to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out in the evening to an Indian restaurant and had another excellent meal. As with Indonesia, food is proving to be one of the highlights of Malaysia.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 31st July</span>
                We decided to stay in Penang another day and go on an all day trip around the island on public buses.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our first stop (after breakfast) was the snake temple. This was alright although the size and quantity of snakes left something to be desired. Our next two bus journeys took us to towns of little interest where we sat in cafes for about half an hour. We then went to a waterfall and swimming hole for half an hour before getting bored and hitching a lift in a minibus to Teluk Bahang, one of the Northern Beaches. We spent a couple of hours on the beach and then caught two more buses to get back to the hotel. Although we saw nothing that was too exciting, it was quite an enjoyable day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to the same place as last night for tea  and then played cards until going to bed.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 1st August</span>
                We checked out of the hotel just after 8 and walked to the ferry terminal. We caught the boat to Butterworth, a bus to Alor Satar and then a taxi to Kuala Perlis. From there, we got another boat to Lankawi, an island that was recommended to us by Hussain and has the added attraction of being duty free. We arrived on the island at about 2 and got a taxi and bus to Pantai Cenang, supposedly the islands nicest beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                This proved to be the first place we have been disappointed with. Although the beach was nice, the room we had was over-priced, there were no good restaurants there and no sign of any duty free beer. We decided that we would leave first thing in the morning and spent the evening playing cards.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd August</span>
                We caught a bus back into Kuah, the island's main town. We got dropped off at the hotel we wanted to stay at. After breakfast of "roti telurs" we set out to look at the duty free shops. Lankawi suddenly seemed a lot better than it had done yesterday!

                Southern Comfort was only £5 a litre and beer only 30p a can. We walked about a mile from where we were staying and then walked back stopping in the bars along the way. By the time we had got back to the hotel, we were all quite pissed. We had bought two litres of Southern Comfort and a bottle of apricot brandy from one of the duty free shops and after tea and a few more beers, we returned to our room to play Chase the Ace. Don't remember going to bed!

                I was still pissed when I woke up and don't remember going to breakfast. Roz spent the first half of the day being ill and Dave and I went out for a walk and ended up on another pub crawl along the sea-front. Tea time is a bit vague in my memory but later on in the evening, Dave and I finished the first litre of Southern Comfort.

                Roz had made a full recovery whilst Dave and I both felt really ill! Dave had thrown up during the night and with the exception of about an hour, spent the whole day in bed. I got up for breakfast and at lunch but also spent the first half of the afternoon in bed <span style="color: #3c1269;">and poor Roz had to go to the beach on her own</span>. Roz and I went out for a meal in the evening and then had to put up with one of the locals showing us his card tricks until bedtime.

                Everyone was feeling healthy again so we got up early and hired mopeds to ride around the island. We had the mopeds delivered to us at the hotel by the girl who had given me a haircut two days ago, just after 9am. We set off with Roz and me on one moped and Dave on the other and headed first of all to see the tomb of someone whose name I can not remember and which wasn't very exciting. From there, Roz took over at driving and we set out to try and find Pantai Kok. The map we had was pretty useless and within about an hour we found ourselves back at Pantai Cenang. We stopped for drinks and then we went back along the coast until we came to Pantai Kok.

                We spent about an hour at the "Seven Wells" waterfalls and swimming holes which were quite good and then Roz and I managed to fall off while riding back to the road. No damage done, however, so we proceeded on to the North of the island. The beaches there were quite nice but the weather wasn't too good so we did not stay long. We rode from there back to Kuah and were back at the hotel by about 5. Again, nothing we had seen had been really spectacular but it was a pretty good day out.
