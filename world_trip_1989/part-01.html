                We arrived in L.A. at 4:20pm after an uneventful fifteen and a half hour flight from Heathrow. By about 6:30 we had found a hostel out near Venice Beach. We had a room for four for $12 each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out at 7 for a meal at a Mexican restaurant and all had tacos. On the way back to the hostel we called into Brennen's Bar for a beer. We had only planned to call in for one drink but all ended up getting totally wrecked. We got back to the hostel at 1 and then me, Paul and Dave went out again for a McDonalds leaving Ed who for some reason was wandering about outside. He was refused entry by the manager because he did not know either his own name or the name of the hostel. When we got back, me and Paul played cards for an hour or so with Ami, an American girl who was staying here. We went out again at 3:30 for food and more beer (but were unsuccessful with the beer) and went to bed at about 4 (by which time Ed had returned). A good start to the holiday. L.A. is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 15th January</span>
                We went for breakfast at Venice Beach with Ami. She drove us down there in her Toyota Celica convertable. Venice Beach was backed with roller skaters, etc with loads of stalls and cafes. We had omelettes for breakfast and me and Dave bought pairs of shorts from one of the stalls.

                Ami then drove us all up to the Universal Film Studios before she drove home. We paid $18 to go for a tour of the studios. For this we had a tram tour of the film sets and saw a load of shows demonstrating effects, etc. It took about two hours to get back to the hostel where, after eating we all had an early night.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 16th January</span>
                This morning we walked to Venice Beach and then along the beach to Santa Monica. We looked around the pier and around one of the shopping malls. We caught a bus out to U.C.L.A. and then started walking towards Beverly Hills and Hollywood. After a while, we decided it was too far to walk so we got a bus back to Santa Monica and went for a pint at an English pub called the King's Head.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the hostel, the receptionist offered us his car for $450. We had a short test drive and decided we would buy it if we could arrange insurance.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the evening playing pool and trivial pursuit while drinking bottles of Bud.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 17th January</span>
                We spent an hour trying to get insurance for the car. The only place that would give us a one month policy would only accept a California license so we had to turn down the offer. We then set out to hire a car. We managed to get one for $370 with 1700 "free miles".
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove along the coast to Malibu which was full of expensive looking houses but overall looked pretty boring. We drove from there to Beverly Hills and Hollywood and climbed up to see the Hollywood letters. The views of L.A. from some of the hills around Hollywood were amazing with miles of buildings covered in a thick layer of smog. We got lost on the way back to the hostel as our map was printed in 1974 and several roads no longer exist. I did all the driving today which was totally confusing at first but not too bad at the end. I think it will take a few days before I am used to driving on the right. We went out for a Mexican meal again and then went back to the hostel to consume more bottles of Bud. Phoned home at 8:45pm using a "magic number" purchased for $10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 18th January</span>
                we checked out of the hostel at 10:30 and started heading towards San Francisco. We drove through Malibu and carried on up the coast road, a bit slower than the freeways but much more interesting. The scenery was excellent with the Pacific on one side and mountains on the other. We stopped in Santa Barbara on the way, a town rebuilt with Spanish style buildings in 1925. We went on a guided tour of the court house which gave great views of the whole town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove non-stop from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo, a town halfway from L.A. to San Francisco. We went for a meal at an all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant and then drove out to a campsite where you could camp for nothing as long as you avoided the warden. We were greeted by a party of raccoons who stole our bread while Paul was erecting his tent. We went to a bar for one drink and then sat in the car with a case of Coors. Dave and I slept in the car, Paul and Ed in Paul's tent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 19th January</span>
                Woke at 7:30 and set off by about 8. I took over from Paul who did all the driving yesterday. The scenery today was more spectacular than yesterdays. We took a ten mile detour which led us up a dirt track over mountains and through a forest of redwood pines. This gave some of the best views of the day but has probably not done the car much good. The car was brand new when we had it but it is starting to look old already. We stopped in the afternoon at Monterray which was pretty boring and then drove the last leg to San Francisco. We crossed the Golden Gate Bridge at about 5:30 and stopped on the other side for photos,etc. It looks like the Severn Bridge only it's red!
            </p>

                We drove from there to the Golden gate Youth Hostel which is only three miles North of San Francisco but is in a national park totally away from the city. We drove back into town for tea and then drove around downtown for about an hour. It was the most difficult place I have ever driven with steep hills, buses & trams as well as normal traffic and totally confusing directions. We drove down Lombard Street which includes "the crookedest street in the world" and around China Town before returning.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 20th January</span>
                Spent the day sight-seeing. We left the car and caught a bus into downtown San Francisco and then walked round most of the places we had seen last night. San Francisco is much easier for sight-seeing than L.A as everything is closer together and within walking distance. We spent most of the morning walking round China Town and the afternoon walking up and down hills to get to various vista points. The views from some of the hills were superb, although the best view was from the outside lift of the Fairmount Hotel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We also went to the tram museum which housed the four motors which power all the trams in the city. The trams are all pulled by four cables which run underneath the streets. We caught a bus back and went to visit a national monument full of redwood trees before returning to the hostel. We went back to Chinatown for our evening meal. Surprisingly, this area was full of Chinese restaurants and we found one where we had large meals for about $4.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 21st January</span>
                Another day of sight-seeing. In the morning, we visited Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a boat out to Alcatraz. We walked around the prison and then had a tour of the cell blocks, everyone with their own Sony Walkman with a cassette guide. Interesting stuff!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On returning to land we walked around Fisherman's Wharf again, this time the place was full of street performers some of whom were excellent. We then visited the small resort town of Sausalito before returning to the hostel to sort out plans for the next few days. We returned to the same restaurant as last night for tea.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 22nd January</span>
                We checked out of the hostel at 9:30 and hit the road again, this time heading East. We crossed over the Oakland Bay Bridge and passed Sacremento, the Californian State capital. We took one detour from the main highway along a road through Nevada City, a town which looked like something straight out of a Western. The road went as high as 7000 feet in places as we crossed over the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The scenery was spectacular again with all the roads and trees covered in snow. We drovve to the small town of Truckee where we intended to stay at the youth hostel. The hostel was closed when we arrived so we had a brief visit to a casino in Nevada which is only about twelve miles away. We returned to the hostel at 4:30 and checked in in time to watch the last quarter of the super bowl.

                All the restaurants were quite expensive in Truckee so, unable to find a McDonalds, we had to have salami sandwiches for tea. Spent the evening talking to two English girls who are traveling round the world with the same route as us.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 23rd January</span>
                We woke up to find the car covered in snow. We drove East to Reno, Nevada and then headed South. We drove about 150 miles before we were out of the snow. We stopped in Carson City, Bridgeport and Bishop for meals, tea breaks, etc and by 4:30, we arrived in the small town of Lone Pine.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Me and Ed went to a bar while Dave and Paul checked into a motel for the night. They rejoined us and we spent three or four hours drinking Bud while talking to some of the locals including an old woman from London and a Vietnam veteran. As with everywhere else we have been, the people were really friendly and we had a couple of rounds of drinks bought for us. At 9, we all returned to the motel room and drank cans of Bud while watching Deliverance. We went out again at  midnight only to discover that Lone Pine had closed down for the night so we crashed out instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 23rd January</span>
                We left Lone Pine at 9 after briefly looking at Mt Whitney, the highest point in continental America. We were heading for Las Vegas which meant crossing Death Valley. We also passed a community called Swansea, population 3.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The scenery as we passed through Death Valley was most impressive with spectacular mountain ranges on both sides of the 15 mile wide valley floor. We passed Badwater which is the lowest point in America. We arrived in Vegas at 4pm and checked into a motel. We have a room with two double beds but it works out cheaper than a youth hostel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Vegas is an incredible town. It consists of "The Strip", a mile long piece of road with nothing but the neon lights of the various casinos. We walked to the far end of the strip to the Circus Circus casino where we had an "all-you-can-eat for $4" meal. There was a huge selection of food so once again we all ate until we felt sick.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We then spent about three hours going round some of the casinos including Caeser's Palace, playing the 5c slot machines. Caeser's Palace was the biggest casino we went in and the most over the top. It contained fruit machines which cost $500 a go. At the end of the evening, I had made a $6 profit.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 24th January</span>
                We deciided to have a break from travelling today after three days in the car and spent most of the day sitting in the motel room with the occasional trip outside for something to eat or more beer. We spent the evening touring the casinos again. I lost my $6 and about $2 more. However, while we were playing the machines, we were getting free drinks which more than compensated for the money being spent. We found one casino where the drinks were served frequently and sat drinking margaritas for about three hours. We went for breakfast at midnight. All the casinos offer cheap food to try and attract gamblers. We went to Frontiers and had 8oz steaks, eggs, toast, etc for just over £1. We then spent about an hour looking for a disco before returning to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After two nights of gambling, none of us had lost more than $6 which was not too bad.

                Spent the day driving through Arizona towards The Grand Canyon. We reached Williams by 4:30 and checked into a motel for the night. We went out for a drink at 10 but crashed out relatively early.

                Spent the day touring along the rim of The Grand Canyon and saw the most spectacular scenery we have seen so far. Most of the roads were covered in snow but we were still able to travel to all the viewing points from Hermit's Rest to Desert View.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 28th January</span>
                Another day spent mostly in the car. We left Flagstaff at 10:30 and headed towards Phoenix. On the way we stopped at Walnut Canyon which was not as good as Grand Canyon but we were able to walk round one of the trails. We passed through Oak Creek Canyon which was quite scenic and then stopped at Montezuma's Castle which was not a castle and had never been visited by Montezuma but was quite interesting anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Phoenix at 4 and spent an hour and a half looking for a motel. The town was pretty grotty all round with some really rough looking areas. Most of the motels we saw rented out rooms by the hour and were expensive for a whole night. We eventually found one which wasn't too bad for $30 so we checked in for the night. We had planned to go out for the evening but in view of the area where we were staying, we decided to stay in instead.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 29th January</span>
                We decided to leave Phoenix without staying for an extra day. There didn't seem much to see or do there so after spending half an hour driving around El Mirage looking for Frank Bruno (without success) we hit the road again, this time heading for Yuma. Yuma is a small town about 10 miles from the Mexican border. It looked a lot nicer and livelier than Phoenix though it seems to consist mainly of super markets, motels and fast food joints. We checked into a motel which cost $40 for the night but is the best we have stayed in so far. We have a working cable T.V. and outside there is a swimming pool and a jacuzzi. We had a quick swim and drank a few beers before going out for the evening. We played pool in a bar for about two hours and then returned to the room where we played cards until going to bed.

We went for another all-you-can-eat Chinese during the afternoon and then had to sit down for the next three hours. Went out for a few drinks and games of pool at 8:30 and then had an early night.
