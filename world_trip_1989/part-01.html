                We arrived in L.A. at 4:20pm after an uneventful fifteen and a half hour flight from Heathrow. By about 6:30 we had found a hostel out near Venice Beach. We had a room for four for $12 each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out at 7 for a meal at a Mexican restaurant and all had tacos. On the way back to the hostel we called into Brennen's Bar for a beer. We had only planned to call in for one drink but all ended up getting totally wrecked. We got back to the hostel at 1 and then me, Paul and Dave went out again for a McDonalds leaving Ed who for some reason was wandering about outside. He was refused entry by the manager because he did not know either his own name or the name of the hostel. When we got back, ma and Paul played cards for an hour or so with Ami, an American girl who was staying here. We went out again at 3:30 for food and more beer (but were unsuccessful with the beer) and went to bed at about 4 (by which time Ed had returned). A good start to the holiday. L.A. is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.

                We went for breakfast at Venice Beach with Ami. She drove us down there in her Toyota Celica convertable. Venice Beach was backed with roller skaters, etc with loads of stalls and cafes. We had ommlettes for breakfast and me and Dave bought pairs of shorts from one of the stalls.

                Ami then drove us all up to the Universal Film Studios before she drove home. We paid $18 to go for a tour of the studios. For this we had a tram tour of the film sets and saw a load of shows demonstrating effects, etc. It took about two hours to get back to the hostel where, after eating we all had an early night.

                This morning we walked to Venice Beach and then along the beach to Santa Monica. We looked around the pier and around one of the shopping malls. We caught a bus out to U.C.L.A and then started walking towards Beverly Hills and Hollywood. After a while, we decided it was too far to walk so we got a bus back to Santa Monica and went for a pint at an English pub called the King's Head.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the hostel, the receptionist offered us his car for $450. We had a short test drive and decided we would buy it if we could arrange insurance.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the evening playing pool and trivial pursuit while drinking bottles of Bud.
