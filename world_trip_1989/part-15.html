                We arrived at Colombo airport just after midnight and by the time we had cleared customs, changed money, etc it was about 12:30. We were joined by Tamara, an English girl traveling on her own and the four of us got a taxi into Colombo town. The taxi driver had been given instructions by someone at the airport and took us to an expensive hotel (£3 each) that we didn't really want to go to. By the time we had got there though, it was about 2am, a bit late for going and looking for somewhere cheaper. We checked into two rooms and eventually got to sleep by about 2:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were all up by 10, and after having a pretty good breakfast, we checked out and started walking towards the railway station. We gave up walking after about five minutes and got into a couple of tuk-tuks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the station, we were met by two Sri Lankan blokes, one who had a guest house at the beach where Tamara wanted to go and the other wanted to take us to a guest house in Kandy. We all bought our tickets and decided we may as well go along with the touts and see what they had to offer.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Tamara caught a train down the coast and we caught the 1:25 to Kandy. The train journey was pretty scenic for most of the three hours it took to reach Kandy. At Kandy station, our "guide" got us a taxi and took us to the Blue Haven Guest House, run by Linton and we checked into a room for three. Linton's wife cooked us tea, a huge meal of rice and curries which was superb even though I don't think we managed to eat half of it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather in Kandy seemed excellent after coming from Bangkok. It is probably the coolest place we have been since New Zealand.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th August</span>
                After a good night's sleep, we woke to another huge meal for breakfast. At about 10:30 we walked down to explore the town of Kandy. The town was  nothing spectacular but there were a couple of good tea rooms. we went round The Temple of the Tooth which was decidedly unspectacular and walked back to the guest house by about 3.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening while we were waiting for tea, we got talking to Lucky, Linton's friend and he managed to convince us that it woudl be worth going on a two day tour in the car with Linton. For US$15 a day each he will take us to Adam's Peak and just about anywhere else we want to go. It seemed a much easier way of getting around than by bus and train. We told them that we would do the trip and they got out the bottle of Arak to celebrate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 26th August</span>
                We had breakfast and were ready to leave by 8:30. We loaded all our stuff into Linton's car, a family size Peugeot 504.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first stop of the trip was at a gem factory which was pretty boring and then we went to a tea factory which was a bit more interesting. We even bought a packet of tea each though I'm not sure how we are going to get them home in tact.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the day driving around admiring the Sri Lankan countryside. Linton proved to be quite a good guide - he kept quiet most of the time unless we asked questions. He took us round a load of waterfalls and waited while we went swimming in a lake.
            </p>

                In the evening, Linton managed to get us a room at the base of Adam's Peak at the house of the assistant superintendent of one of the two plantations. It was like staying in some sort of stately home. Tea was served in a tea set on a silver tray and we were waited on by a servent during the evening meal. Once again, there was a mountain of food , fried rice, chicked curry and the inevitable dahl and poppadoms.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had an early night due to having to get up early tomorrow.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 27th August</span>
                We got up at 5:45 and set off at 6 to climb Adam's Peak. Linton decided to come with us to show us the way. We had a half an hour walk to the start of the climb and then the steps started. The stairs go all the way to the top, about 2 - 3km - one of the longest staircases in the world. Roz dropped out half way up and as we got closer to the top, I began to wish I had as well. It was pretty hard work but we eventually made it to the top after three and a half hours. The views at the top (and the water fountains) made the climb worthwhile though we were pretty worn out by the time we reached the bottom again. When we reached the place we were staying, they served us breakfast and we had showers and an hours rest before continuing our journey.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Adam's Peak at 1:30 and drove to Nawara Eliya, about three hours away. There wasn't a lot to see along the way but we nearly had to go to another tea factory. Luckily, it was closed and we proceeded to a hotel. We checked in and then paid Linton US$90 and said our goodbyes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another lazy evening. Dinner was served at 7:30 and I was in bed asleep by 9.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 28th August</span>
                We spent the morning lazing around the room. We checked out at midday and, after a pot of tea, walked into town to catch a bus to the railway station. We arrived at the station just after 1, intending to catch the 1:30 train to Haputale. When we tried to buy tickets, we were told that the train was currently running two and a half hours late. We discussed the possibility of catching a bus instead but eventually decided to wait for the train. It eventually turned up at 3:50, totally packed. We had been told that the train journey took two and a half hours so weren't really prepared when the train arrived in Haputale at 5:20. By the time I had realised what was happening, and we had started getting our rucksacks down, the train had started moving out of the station. We had just about got off when the guard stopped the train for us. Most embarrassing!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were met at the station by someone who owned one of the guest houses recommended in the book so went with him in a free taxi to his home. We were given two rooms for about £1.60 and the usual huge pile of food for tea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the evening, Dave decided he wanted to go to World's End tomorrow while Roz and I are keen on heading for the beaches. Although I have enjoyed the hill stations, we don't seem to be doing a lot in the last couple of days except traveling between different towns. We agreed to split up for a night and meet up again at a place near Matara that Linton had recommended to us. Had an early night again.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 29th August</span>
                We got up just after 6, had an early breakfast and walked into town by 7:30. Dave went to the railway station - Roz and I stayed at the bus station. A bus came at 8:30 for Wellawaya where we had to change to get a bus to the beach. The first journey was not too bad. The bus was crowded but we both had seats all the way. We arrived in Wellawaya at 10:50 and only had to wait ten minutes for a bus to Matara. This was the worst bus journey I have ever been on. We were standing up all the way and for the first 15 minutes, there wasn't enough room for us to take our rucksacks off. Most of the journey it was impossible to move as there were so many people on the bus. We had a 20 minute lunch stop at 2 and eventually got to Matara at about 3:30. The scenery along the way was totally different to anything we had seen before in Sri Lanka. Everywhere we had been before had been green, hilly and covered with tea plantations. Most of the way from Wellawaya was flat, dry almost desert like until we reached the coast. Traveling along the coast was real torture. We could see the sea for about the last two hours of the journey but knew we were stuck on the bus until Matara.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Matara, we caught a minibus to within about a mile of where we were staying and were then given a lift in a tractor type thing by a local. We arrived at the T K Guest House at 4 and after a much needed drink, headed for the beach. We had a quick swim and then lay on the beach until the sun went down.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had potato curry, rice and dahl for tea - one of the beast meals since getting here. Spent the evening playing cards.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 30th August</span>
                It was good waking up knowing we didn't have to go anywhere. We had quite a late breakfast and then got a minibus into town where we had to change money. We changed a travelers cheque at the bank with remarkable ease and then walked back to Pelhena (saving the 5p bus fare) stopping to buy a couple of bottles of arak on the way. The local bottle shops sold cans of Fosters and Heineken as well as all the local goodies. We spent about an hour on the beach and returned to the guest house to discover that Dave had arrived.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we played cards and drank the arak. Two bottles proved to be insufficient and we had to buy some beer before going to bed.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 31st August</span>
                We didn't do much all day. In the morning Dave and I went to the bottle shop for three more bottles of arak while Roz went to the beach for about half an hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The rest of the day was spent lying around the room, writing letters and generally killing time. We had egg and chips for lunch, a a meal that took about two hours to prepare due to the cook being out to lunch.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We started on the arak at about 5 and went out for tea at 7:30. We decided to try eating at a different guest house further along the beach. This proved to be a good move as we had a better meal for less than half the price we had been paying and we were also offered a room for three for about 60 - 70p. We told the owner that we would return tomorrow and then went back to the room to finish the arak. I don't remember going to bed!
