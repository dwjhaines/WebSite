                We left the hostel at 10:10 after a night of heavy rain. We tried to get into Kalburri National Park but the road leading to it was closed due to flooding. At one point, we had to wait half an hour as the highway we were on was inpassable. After the water had cleared we proceeded North, stopping for lunch at Overlander Roadhouse. We then left the main highway and headed for Monkey Mia where you can go into the sea and feed the dolphins. We saw a couple there but decided to return to feed them tomorrow.

                We drove back to Denham where we checked into the backpackers. We got a self-contained unit for $40.

                Woke at 7:00 after another night of heavy rain. We left Denham at about 8:30 and drove to Monkey Mia. There were about six dolphins who came to the beach to be fed. It was an incredible experiance. The dolphins come to within about a metre of the beach and eat fish out of your hand. We spent about an hour standing knee deep in the water feeding and stroking the dolphins. To get to Monkey Mia, we had gone over 300km out of our way but it had been well worth it!

                We drove direct from Monkey Mia to Caernarvon, a distance of 350km. On arrival in Caernarvon, we were told that the road North of the town was blocked due to flood water and we were likely to be stuck there for at least a couple of days. We tried about four caravan sites before finding one with a vacancy - a four birth van for $37 a night. My bunk is about 4'6" long!

                We went for a walk in the evening and discovered a banana plantation with bunches lying about on the floor. We went back for the car and now have a three month supply of bananas. We also drove to the bridge over the River Gasgoyne. The water level was rising to 5m while we watched and the bridge was closed at 10pm.

                We woke at 8ish and drove down to the bridge again. The normally dry river was now at 6.3 m and flowing over the top of the bridge. The bridge will be closed for at least 24 hours more.

                The bridge was reopened and we left Caernarvon at about 10. We encountered a few floods on the way North but nothing too deep to drive through. We crossed the Tropic of Capricorn at about midday. We stopped at Borrowdale for lunch and I saw live kangaroos for the first time since getting to Australia. They were in a cage by a roadhouse.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a fairly uneventful journey from there and arrived in Karratha at about 5:30. We checked into a camp site with four blokes, two of which we have kept bumping into since Geraldton. Tim and I slept in my tent, Carolyn and Linda in the car.

                We drove to Broome via Port Headland, a distance of over 800km. Port Headland was pretty boring without much in the way of sights. We had problems starting the car at Sandfire but Graham, one of the blokes we were with last night got it going again for us. They are also traveling to Darwin.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Broome at 6:30 and booked an on site caravan for $48 per night. After showering and eating, we went out to Broome's only pub for a few drinks. We also visited a funfair.

                Spent the morning sight-seeing - Anastasia's Pool, Shell House and Japanese Cemetery, none of which I found particularly exciting. In the afternoon we went to Cable Beach, a 22km stretch of almost deserted sand. The weather was not brilliant but it was warm enough to sun-bathe and swim.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went to The Sun Picture Theater, the oldest working picture show in the world. It has a large screen in a garden and we all sat in rows of deck-chairs. We were lucky to be there on a film club (SPIFS) night and were treated to free food and beer throughout the film. A good night out

                We checked out of the caravan park at 10 and went straight down to Cable Beach where we spent all day sun-bathing. We had a few beers in the evening and went to sleep in the car parked about half a mile from the beach.

                We were woken at 6 by a woman whose drive we were blocking. Spent most of the day on the beach and I now have sun burn. We went down to the pub in the evening and had entertainment provided by fighting aborigines. We decided we would stay another day in Broome and also to sleep in the car again.

                We woke at about 7:30. The weather was both windy and cloudy so we decided not to stay on for the extra day. We left Broome at 9 and drove to Fitzroy Crossing where we saw Geikie Gorge. We spent about two hours walking along the gorge and then drove to Halls Creek where we booked into a camp site for the night.

                Tim, Linda and Carolyn went on a flight over the Bungle Bungles at 8:30 and we left Hall's Creek when they returned at 10:30. Stopped at Turkey Creek for lunch and then drove to Wyndam which was pretty boring (Crocodile Lookout with no crocodiles, etc). We had to stop a couple of times because the car was overheating, mainly I think because we drove non-stop through the hottest part of the day.

                We left the hostel at 10 and drove to Kathrine stopping at Timber Creek and Victoria River en route. We crossed into Northern Territories at 10:30 and arrived in Katherine at 6:30. We drove to the hospital and found Paula who lives in the nurses home. Paula was working nights so the rest of us went back into Katherine and got drunk, first at a pub full of aborigines and then at a night club which remained open until 4:00. We left when it closed and got back to Paula's at about 4:30.

                We spent the day paddling canoes through Katherine Gorge. We hired canoes at 9:30 and spent four hours going up stream through the first three gorges stopping at waterfalls, ponds, etc en route. The scenery was excellent all the way, probably the best I have seen since getting to Australia.

                We stopped and had lunch on the side of the river at about 1 and then paddled back again shooting the rapids and having frequent water fights on the way. Paula, Tim and me all managed to capsize our canoes at least once. We all got totally soaked and are covered in bruises from carrying the canoes over rapids. We are also totally worn out but it was an excellent day out.

                Left Katherine at 11:40. Most of the day was wasted because we left so late and had to drive slowly to stop the car over-heating . We stopped at Edith Falls, part of the Katherine Gorge National Park and eventually arrived in Darwin at about 6:30. After getting turned away from a few places we managed to get beds at Sunset City Hostel. We had a quick look around town and then had an early night.

                We walked around Darwin in the morning. It is a new but not particularly exciting city. At midday we went to Mindil Beach where we spent the rest of the day. (Also went to Doctor's Gully to feed the fish)

                We picked Ed up just after 8 and set off for Kakadu National Park, about 250km East of Darwin. We arrived at the park HQ at about 11:30 and after collecting various maps, etc we set off on several of the walking tours around the park. The scenery was quite good without being truly spectacular. We walked to Baroallra Springs, one of the few places in the park you can swim without having to worry about crocodiles. At 6 we drove to Cooinda and booked into the camp site. Spent the evening in the camp site bar playing cards.

                At 9am we went on a two hour cruise of Yellow Waters. The cruise was quite good, we saw about four crocodiles, but it did drag on a bit towards the end as it seemed to cater mainly for bird watchers. We drove from Yellow Waters to Ubirr where we saw aboriginal paintings and about the best views of the park we have seen so far. The drive from Ubirr back to Darwin took about five hours as the car was overheating and we couldn't open the bonnet to put in water. We arrived in Darwin at about 8 to find all the hostels were fullup so, after a quick look around the market at Mindil Beach, we drove out of the city to a camp site.

                We left the camp site at 10 and, after sorting the car out, spent about an hour wandering around the town before going down to Mindil Beach. We stayed on the beach until 3 and then started heading South towards Katherine and Alice Springs. It was a shame to leave Darwin after such a short time as it seemed to be quite a nice city. I think I would have stayed longer had I not told Gordon that I would be in Alice at the start of July.

Carolyn is staying there for a few weeks before rejoining us in Alice. We left Mataranka at about 3 and drove as far as Tennant Creek stopping at Dunmarra for food on the way. We arrived in Tennant Creek at 10 to find the hostel full , so again, had to camp out again.

                Had a letter from Gordon waiting for me at the post office. He is in Melbourne and should get to Alice later this week. I started looking for a job at 9 and was working by about 9:15. It is temporary work at a fruit and veg wholesalers and involves sortinig tomatoes for $7 per hour. It is not very exciting work or very good money but at least it is some form of income. Tomorrow is a day off but there is work here again on Wednesday. Time and Linda also turned up and got jobs there.

                I spent most of the day trying to decide what to do between now and September when Jane arrives in Cairns. There does nto seem much point in staying in Alice for two months without having a good job Accomodation is expensive and there is not much to do here. Tim and Ed are both keen on leaving quite soon so I think we will probably go to Cairns in about two weeks.

                Tim, Linda and I spent five hours packing tomatoes. I had a hangover. Got paid $7 an hour cash in hand.

                We had two days off work again so we all went off to Ayers Rock for a couple of days. We took about five hours getting to Yulara, the resort near the rock and arrived there at about 3. We looked around the town and then drove out to sunset point and took photos of the rock as it changed colour.

                We pitched our tent on the Yulara campsite and then went on a one hour star gazing tour which was quite interesting. We spent half an hour in the bar before returning to the campsite at 9:30 for an early night.

                Woke at 7 after a night spent trying to get warm. We were caught by the campsite rangers for not payingn our camping fees so after making our excuses, we had to pay $7 each.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We saw the rock at sun rise and then climbed to the top of it. It was quite hard work getting to the top but we all made it eventually. The views from the top were excellent and made the climb worthwhile. After climbing down again, we went on a walk around the rock, a distance of 9km.

                We drove back to Alice and went back to the backpackers where after a mix up with the booking, we got given two double rooms.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a few drinks in the evening as Linda is leaving us tomorrow to go and work on a homestead for a couple of months.

                Tim and I went to work at 9 and put in seven and a half hours. It is a ridiculous job - the slower you work, the more money you make. We managed to pinch a load of fruit (pineapples, strawberries, etc) while the boss was away. In the evening, we went to The Alice Springs Show and fireworks display.

                Spent all day doing nothing. Alice Springs is pretty boring on a Sunday.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 10th July</span>
                We worked for four and a half hours. I decided I wanted to leave Alice on Thursday and work for two days at The Tennent Creek Show. Tim is leaving by bus on Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to the bar for a drink in the evening and ended up getting drunk in someones room. There is nothing to do here but drink.

                Woke at 9 with a slight hangover. At 1, Me, Tim, Ed and Jackie, a girl from work, went out sight-seeing in the car. We drove out to Simpsons Gap and Standly Chasm, neither of which were over exciting.

                Me and Tim went to work in the morning - Tim left at 12 to get a bus to Cairns. I worked until 3 with Jackie who is from London. Gordon arrived in Alice at lunchtime so we all went down to the pub in the evening. After a few beers, we decided not to go t Cairns but to return to Darwin working at the shows at Tennant Creek and Katherine on the way. I wanted to do this, Jackie was going that way anyway, Gordon wanted to go to Kakadu and Ed didn't care where we went so it was practically unanimous. I don't know if Tim will be happy.

                We left Alice at 10 without Gordon who is going to Ayers Rock and then rejoining us at Tennant Creek tomorrow night. We arrived in Tennant Creek at about 4 and I managed to get two days work at a "Barramundi and Chips" stall. Jackie found the job for me. It pays $10 an hour.

                We had a bar-b-q in the evening at the caravan site - cheeseburgers and wine.

                I started work at 7. The job is quite good fun and involves preparing, cooking and serving fish burgers, steak burgers, etc. I alos get to eat whatever I want. At the end of the day I got paid $100 for about 9 hours work.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went to The Tennant Creek Hotel, a typical NT pub and waited for Gordon who arrived at about 9.

                I worked from 8 until 2 for $50. When I had finished, I met up with the others and we spent a couple of hours looking around the show. In the evening we bought a case of beer and had another bar-b-q.

                left Tennant Creek at 8. We arrived at Mataranka at 3 and went for a dip in the thermal springs. We had a few drinks by the tents and then went to the bar where at 10, we met Carolyn who is working at the campsite restaurant. We continued drinking after the bar shut and got to bed sometime after midnight.
