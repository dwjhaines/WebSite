                I was woken at 3:30 by the park's sprinkler system which seemed designed to soak every bench in the park. I could not be bothered to walk anywhere so I stood up for two hours until it started getting light. I sat by the station until the McDonalds opened and then had my breakfast. At 8, I collected mail form the post office. I had one letter from Mum and one from Roz informing me that they were all at the long term youth hostel at Fremantle. I went round the youth hostels looking for Dave, Ed and Paul who were nowhere to be found but then appeared while I was writing them messages at the post office. Dave had caught a train from Adelaide and had arrived at the same time as Paul and Ed.

                We caught a train out to Fremantle and walked to the "Freo 200" hostel. The hostel is similar to a hall of residence. We all have single rooms for $50 a week. We booked in for a month and then went to find Roz and Linda. Linda was in but Roz was working. We all went to the cafe where Roz was for cups of tea and then went on the beer for the rest of the day. We stayed in a bar near the station waiting for Roz and then went back to the hostel to pay for our months rent which me, Dave and Paul had to borrow from Linda. We continued drinking at a bar near the hostel until 11 and then returned totally pissed. We then drank wine in Roz or Linda's room until about 1:30.

                I woke at 5:30 on Linda's floor, not too sure how I got there. I returned to my own room and went back to sleep. Dave, Paul and Ed went into Perth at 9 to look for jobs. I went in with Tim and joined them at 1. We spent the afternoon going round job agencies without much success and returned to the hostel at 5.

                Me and Ed had our first morning's work today. We were down at the C.E.S. job centre when someone came and asked us if we wanted an hour and a halfs casual work. We jumped at the chance and spent two hours weeding a garden and dismantling a corrugated aluminium construction for $20 each. I was looking in the job centre again in the afternoon when I was told I might be better off going round factories in person and looking for work.

                Paul and I went to O'Conner at about 9 and started asking round various different places. In the fourth place we went, we were told thye almost certainly have a place for one of us, possibly two. We were told to phone back tomorrow. We took the rest of the day off.

                I went for an interview at Victoria Park and got a job as a salesman. I'm not quite sure what it entails but I will find out on Monday. Had a haircut.
