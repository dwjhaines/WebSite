                I was woken at 3:30 by the park's sprinkler system which seemed designed to soak every bench in the park. I could not be bothered to walk anywhere so I stood up for two hours until it started getting light. I sat by the station until the McDonalds opened and then had my breakfast. At 8, I collected mail form the post office. I had one letter from Mum and one from Roz informing me that they were all at the long term youth hostel at Fremantle. I went round the youth hostels looking for Dave, Ed and Paul who were nowhere to be found but then appeared while I was writing them messages at the post office. Dave had caught a train from Adelaide and had arrived at the same time as Paul and Ed.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught a train out to Fremantle and walked to the "Freo 200" hostel. The hostel is similar to a hall of residence. We all have single rooms for $50 a week. We booked in for a month and then went to find Roz and Linda. Linda was in but Roz was working. We all went to the cafe where Roz was for cups of tea and then went on the beer for the rest of the day. We stayed in a bar near the station waiting for Roz and then went back to the hostel to pay for our months rent which me, Dave and Paul had to borrow from Linda. We continued drinking at a bar near the hostel until 11 and then returned totally pissed. We then drank wine in Roz or Linda's room until about 1:30.

                I woke at 5:30 on Linda's floor, not too sure how I got there. I returned to my own room and went back to sleep. Dave, Paul and Ed went into Perth at 9 to look for jobs. I went in with Tim and joined them at 1. We spent the afternoon going round job agencies without much success and returned to the hostel at 5.

                Me and Ed had our first morning's work today. We were down at the C.E.S. job centre when someone came and asked us if we wanted an hour and a halfs casual work. We jumped at the chance and spent two hours weeding a garden and dismantling a corrugated aluminium construction for $20 each. I was looking in the job centre again in the afternoon when I was told I might be better off going round factories in person and looking for work.

                Paul and I went to O'Conner at about 9 and started asking round various different places. In the fourth place we went, we were told thye almost certainly have a place for one of us, possibly two. We were told to phone back tomorrow. We took the rest of the day off.

                I went for an interview at Victoria Park and got a job as a salesman. I'm not quite sure what it entails but I will find out on Monday. Had a haircut.

                Went to the beach both days. On Saturday, we spent a couple of hours at South Beach and on Sunday went by train to Cottesloe. On the way to Cottesloe, I went to Swanbourne and found the house that Dad had stayed during the second world war. I took photos of the house and surrounding area. Phoned home.

                Started my career as a salesman at 8:45. Finished it at 1:20. The job entailed walking round shops and offices selling junk to anyone stupid enough to buy it. I'd had enough after four and a half hours and decided to knock it on the head.

                Back to O'Conner to look for work. I walked around the factories for about two and a half hours before I found a job as a cleaner with a company called Steelmark. The job sounds pretty boring but pays $310 a week.

                Easter Day - We had a picnic at South Beach. Six of us (Dave excluded) together with Julie from Clyne and her friends spent the day at the beach.

                A good day out with plenty to eat and loads of beer. We left the beach at 8ish and called in for eight litres of wine on the way back. We then had a party in my room, most of which I can't remember due to being asleep.

                Three pretty boring days. Work is getting really depressing.. I had some form of flu on Wednesday but had to work as I need the money. I went to bed as soon as I got back and, with the exception of getting up for food, slept until Thursday morning. I felt better by Thursday and was also cheered up by the news that I am earning $10 an hour. I received my first pay packet - $265 take home for four days work

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went into Fremantle again in the evening, this time for a pizza. We had to come home early after the meal as Roz and Linda were too pissed to go anywhere else after the meal.

                I went to South Perth in the morning to find friends of my grandmother from during the war. Managed to find their house quite easily. They were both really old and the conversation was a bit difficult but I did get free lunch. Mrs Marland gave me $50 as I left.

                I met Roz and Linda in Cottesloe and we returned to hit Fremantle's night spots for the third night running. We had a really good night out ending up in a disco. I had to leave early as I am on shift work from now on and have to be up at 4:45 every morning.

                A quiet day. I didn't want to go back to sweeping floors so I packed in my job. Although the money was good, I was not enjoying the job and I decided it was not worth the effort. I had a hangover for most of the day.

Roz and Linda cooked spaghetti in the evening but I couldn't really celebrate due to starting work at 11. Roz and Linda celebrated for me. We had a look at a Holden Kingswood station wagon that someone was selling for $2,700 today. I was keen on buying it but was out-voted.

                It was a great day out and I don't remember too much about the journey home. We spent about two hours in Clancey's which I remember none of. I phoned home at 11pm.

                A quiet week. I worked day shift, 7 - 3. We went out for a meal on Friday but no-one really got drunk except for Roz.

                It looks as if my tax rebate cheque has bounced leaving me $500 in debt to Roz. I decided to spend the last of my cash on a cassette plyer and start paying Roz back next week. We went out for a few drinks in the evening but I did not feel like doing much so I came back early.

                We arranged to buy a car today. We test drove a Holden Kingswood station wagon in the morning and decided to buy it. The bloke selling it phoned in the evening and said he would bring it round tomorrow morning. It costs $2,500. I do not know if it is a good buy or not but at least we now have some form of transport.

                We collected the car and paid the money + $263 transfer fee, stamp duty and one years registration fee which also covers the minimum insurance. I now owe Roz $1141. On afternoons all week, 3 - 11.

                Again, not much happened all week due to working bloody silly hours. I spent half of Wednesday while various doctors looked at the cyst on my eyelid. It is to be removed on 1st June meaning two days off work.

                Me, Roz, Linda and Tim decided to have a weekend away from Freo so we drove to Hyden to see Wave Rock. After about half an hour of sight-seeing, we started a pub crawl from Hyden to Narrogin stopping for a beer in every town on the way. We arrived in Narrogin at about six. Me and Tim hid while Roz and Linda checked into a motel and we all went out and got drunk in Narrogin's two pubs.

                We had breakfast at 10:30 and then drove North to York. We went to a couple of pubs and decided it would be worth coming back at some stage to spend more time there. We had quite a good drive back to Freo stopping in several pubs. Me, Roz and Linda went to The Vung Tau and got drunk again. Overall, a good weekend!
