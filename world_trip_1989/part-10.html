                We left Bondi at 12 noon and caught buses to the airport. Our flight was due to leave at 3:10  but was about an hour late due to a broken conveyer belt. The flight was pretty boring and we landed in Auckland at 9pm local time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We found a spot to crash out at the aiport and apart from being moved to a different place at 1am, had quite a good night's sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th March</span>
                We were awake by about 6:30 and started hitching South straight away.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">
                Airport &#x2192; Motorway &#x2192; Bombay &#x2192; Hamilton (almost) &#x2192; Te Kewa &#x2192; Te Kuiti &#x2192; Taumarunui &#x2192; Scenic Lookout &#x2192; Bulls
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Quite a good day's hitching. We started off quite well getting lifts within 5 - 10 minutes every time. When we were 13 km from Hamilton, a wheel fell off the combi van we were traveling in. Dave and I were well amused. The driver was not so happy.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were stuck at Te Kewa for about three hours and by 5:30 were less than half way to Wellington. We were at this time stuck half way up a mountain at a scenic lookout. from here we got a lift to Bulls only about 150km from Wellington. We were dropped outside a campsite and given a handful of grass by the driver. We pitched the tent, got stoned and had an early night.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got lifts almost straight away every time we stopped. We got into Wellington at lunch time and went to the McDonalds.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Wellington didn't look particularly exciting so we decided to leave for Picton on the first available ferry. The ferry left at 4:00pm so we killed time in a couple of pubs. On the boat, we drank a litre of Southern Comfort so neither of us remember arriving in Picton. Somehow we managed to check into a youth hostel assume we went to bed quite early again. Somewhere along the line, we managed to smoke or lose the grass.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 6th March</span>
                We woke up not really sure where we were. We were not 100% sure whether or not we were still in Picton.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We deduced that we were in Picton Y.H.A. and after having a large breakfast, set off for Christchurch.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">

            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The day started well as we had a lift before we had walked out of Picton. We then got stuck at Spring Creek for about three hours and by 3pm had only reached Blenhiem, 27km from where we started. We then had our best lift so far taking us nearly all the way and we finally arrived in Christchurch at 7:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The Y.H.A. was full so we checked into the Y.M.C.A. for the night. The Y.M.C.A is brand new and is just like a hall of residence. We paid $35 and got probably the best room I have stayed in since leaving home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a brief walk around the city and a quick beer then crashed out for the night.

                We went straight to the job centre when we got up. The staff were much friendlier than in the Australian C.E.S. offices and didn't seem in the slightest bit concerned that we didn't have work permits. We were sent for an interview at an orchard for apple picking jobs and were told we could start tomorrow. The money is pretty poor but at least we are working.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus back into Christchurch and got tax numbers from the Inland Revenue office. Again, they didn't seem to mind that we aren't actually allowed to work in New Zealand. The job is about five miles out of Christchurch, too far to get to by 8am with rucksacks, so we moved out of the Y.m.C.A. and into a camp site nearer the orchard. We have a room for two for only $100 a week. It has four bunks in it but we have been told that we have it to ourselves.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th March</span>
                we got up at 6:30 and walked the three and a half miles to the orchard only to be told that there was no work today and to phone back later to find out about work for tomorrow. We walked back to the camp site and decided to go into Christchurch and look for more reliable jobs. Again, the job centre staff were really helpful. Dave got two interviews, the result of which he gets tomorrow and I managed to get a job as a survey assistant. The money is not too good again but the job looks a lot more interesting than picking apples. It also means that if Dave does get one of the two jobs he is waiting to hear from, we can move into a flat in the city instead of being stuck in the middle of nowhere.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 9th March</span>
                A boring days work. It is mainly laboring work. I don't think I'll do it for more than a couple of months.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 10th March</span>
                We spent most of the day flat hunting. We walked miles but eventually managed to get a two-bedroom flat within about 15 minutes walk from teh city. It is about the best flat we saw and one of the only ones that had a fridge. We move in on Monday or Tuesday night.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 12th March</span>
                We moved into the flat. It is better than we originally thought as it has a washing machine and a working phone.

                We are now at the end of our stay in New Zealand. Tomorrow, Roz and I hope to fly to Auckland as we are flying to Bali on Tuesday morning. If we don't get on a flight tomorrow, we fly to Auckland at 5:50 on Tuesday morning. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent nearly all our time in New Zealand in Christchurch and are still living in the same flat that we moved into in March. I kept the same job all the time we were here. After the first few days, it became quite interesting but after doing it for a couple of months, I got pretty fed up with it. Most of the time the job was repetitive and the cold weather didn't help. Dave also did the same job for the three and a half months. He is working for an electronics company doing assembly work or something similar. He is going to be working for another two weeks before flying out to Singapore where he will meet up with Paula for a couple of days. We hope to meet him again in about three weeks time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz arrived in New Zealand four weeks after us and has spent most of her time here working in the credit control department of a building society. So far none of us have had any problems about our lack of work visas. Roz was asked to produce hers but successfully managed to avoid taking her passport in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have been trying to save up money while we have been here but still seem to have managed to go out a couple of times a week. Dave has been working much longer hours than Roz and I so he has been limiting his drinking to Saturday nights. I think we have been drunk just about every Saturday since we have been here. Roz and I have also been out together at least once a week. The pubs over here are better than the ones in Australia, much more like English pubs. There is also a good range of B.Y.O.s in Christchurch so most Saturdays have consisted of a pub crawl followed by a vaguely remembered meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our sight-seeing has consisted of a four day trip around the South Island in a hire car. We loaded the car up with a case and a half of VB and nine litres of wine and headed out of Christchurch towards Arthurs Pass and the West coast. We stopped in a few pubs and ended up getting to Franz Joseph, already quite pissed (except Roz who was driving). We checked into a motor camp and got through our first box of wine before going out to the pub. None of us remember getting back too clearly.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The next day we had hangovers and the weather was appalling so we didn't bother with Franz Joseph Glacier. We drive down to Fox Glacier and although the weather wasn't any better, we climbed most of the way to the top. We got totally soaked but the walk was quite good fun. We drove from the glacier down through Hoast Pass to Wanaka where we had another evening in the pub.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The next day we went to the maze and puzzle center. I really enjoyed the maze but the puzzles seemed to make my headache worse. We took the scenic mountain road to Queenstown and arrived there in time for lunch. Queenstown was a really nice place. We spent most of the evening driving around the area. Again, the scenery was pretty spectacular. We went to watch people bungy jumping though I decided I couldn't afford to have a go myself. In the evening we went to the best B.Y.O. restaurant I have been to yet. It was a small place with a log fire and a great atmosphere. We left there when we ran out of wine and spent the rest of the evening in the pub before returning to the motor camp relatively sober.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On the Monday morning, the last day of our trip, Dave and I went up to the gondola station that overlooks Queenstown and the lake. We drove out to Skippers Canyon, went for a walk around the lake and went for a drink again before heading back to Christchurch. I got caught speeding on the way home, a fine of $120. Apart from this, it was a really good weekend.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I also had a good weekend hitch-hiking to Timaru and back. On the way back, Roz asked the driver of the car if New Zealand imported sheep!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The job that I did enabled me to see quite a lot of the area around Chistchurch. Some of the places I was working I would quite happily have paid to go to for the day. The scenery just about made up for the fact that the job was so boring.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We have just about saved up enough money for the overland journey home. Dave has been earning more money than me as my overtime has been limited due to a lack of hours of daylight. I have been taking home just over $300 a week and have saved $3000. Roz has bought my ticket to Bali on her visa card so I have about £1000 for the five months we plan to spend in Asia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The coverage of the World Cup has been pretty bad over here. So far we have just had about half an hours highlights per day of games played the previous day. The live coverage starts here next week after we have left.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th June</span>
                We spent the morning sorting out travelers cheques, health certificates, etc and the afternoon visiting a few of Christchurch's pubs for the final time. We said our goodbyes to Dave and caught a bus out to the airport where we were told that we couldn't fly out tonight but would have to wait for the 5:50 flight tomorrow morning. We managed to find a place in the arrivals lounge where we could stay for the night and there was a tele so I spent most of the night watching cricket.
