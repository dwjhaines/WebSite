                We spent the day looking for a house. We drove out to Bondi where we wanted to find a place and spent about two hours walking round estate agents. We started off looking for a four or five bedroom house but soon realised that this would be hard to find and expensive. We eventually settled for a two bedroom flat which is about a ten minute walk form the beach. The flat is unfurnished and a bit small for five people but it's cheap ($180 per week) and ideally situated. By the time we had sorted out gas, electricity, etc it was about 4pm. We drove back to the Y.H.A. where we were booked in for another night.

                Me, Ed and Gordon went out for a curry.

                We moved into our flat in the morning. I have the "sun room" to myself. It is only about 8' by 5' but at least it is my own room. We spent most of the day sorting our things out and constructing furniture out of cardboard boxes. We had to buy a fridge and a few mattresses from a second hand shop and also bought some plaltes, etc from a garage sale.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we all went out to Kings Cross, Sydney's red light district. We managed to buy some grass and then returned to the flat.

                We had planned to go sight-seeing today but no-one could be bothered. It was too cold to go to the beach so we spent the afternoon drinking beer and playing Trivial Pursuit. Started growing pot plants.

                We all started looking for work. I tried for a job from the paper on my way to the city but was too late. Once in the city, I got a  job with the first agency I went to. It is clerical work on the far side of the city for $10.62 an hour. It is not ideal as it is quite a way from Bondi but it will do until I find something better. Jane also got a job as a kitchen hand/waitress. Linda has a job as a housekeeper.

                My job is pretty boring. It is typical office work, filing, data entry, drinking tea, etc. It takes an hour each way in the car.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th September</span>
                The job got a bit more interesting. In the evening we went out and hired a television. It is brand new and only costs $20 a month.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st September</span>
                I discovered that the company I am working for is the one that owns Jewsons. I spent most of the day putting invoices into envelopes. I am getting fed up with having to drive to work each day. The job would be quite good if it was in the city.

                I had a day off work today as they only wanted me for three days this week. Jane and I went into Sydney and went round the sights. We saw the opera house and bridge and spent about an hour in the harbour area. We had lunch at Martin Place where bands perform every day. I collected my pay check from work and we went back to Bondi.

                We went to a garage sale in the morning and managed to buy a set of saucepans so we can start cooking food at last. We didn't do much all day. The weather is not really hot enough for lying on the beach all day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent the evening watching tele. I can't afford to go out at the moment as all my pay is going on debts built up over the last month.
