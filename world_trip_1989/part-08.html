                We spent the day looking for a house. We drove out to Bondi where we wanted to find a place and spent about two hours walking round estate agents. We started off looking for a four or five bedroom house but soon realised that this would be hard to find and expensive. We eventually settled for a two bedroom flat which is about a ten minute walk form the beach. The flat is unfurnished and a bit small for five people but it's cheap ($180 per week) and ideally situated. By the time we had sorted out gas, electricity, etc it was about 4pm. We drove back to the Y.H.A. where we were booked in for another night.

                We moved into our flat in the morning. I have the "sun room" to myself. It is only about 8' by 5' but at least it is my own room. We spent most of the day sorting our things out and constructing furniture out of cardboard boxes. We had to buy a fridge and a few mattresses from a second hand shop and also bought some plaltes, etc from a garage sale.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we all went out to Kings Cross, Sydney's red light district. We managed to buy some grass and then returned to the flat.

                We had planned to go sight-seeing today but no-one could be bothered. It was too cold to go to the beach so we spent the afternoon drinking beer and playing Trivial Pursuit. Started growing pot plants.

                We all started looking for work. I tried for a job from the paper on my way to the city but was too late. Once in the city, I got a  job with the first agency I went to. It is clerical work on the far side of the city for $10.62 an hour. It is not ideal as it is quite a way from Bondi but it will do until I find something better. Jane also got a job as a kitchen hand/waitress. Linda has a job as a housekeeper.

                My job is pretty boring. It is typical office work, filing, data entry, drinking tea, etc. It takes an hour each way in the car.

                The job got a bit more interesting. In the evening we went out and hired a television. It is brand new and only costs $20 a month.

                I discovered that the company I am working for is the one that owns Jewsons. I spent most of the day putting invoices into envelopes. I am getting fed up with having to drive to work each day. The job would be quite good if it was in the city.

                I had a day off work today as they only wanted me for three days this week. Jane and I went into Sydney and went round the sights. We saw the opera house and bridge and spent about an hour in the harbour area. We had lunch at Martin Place where bands perform every day. I collected my pay check from work and we went back to Bondi.

                We went to a garage sale in the morning and managed to buy a set of saucepans so we can start cooking food at last. We didn't do much all day. The weather is not really hot enough for lying on the beach all day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Spent the evening watching tele. I can't afford to go out at the moment as all my pay is going on debts built up over the last month.

                Jane and Linda both gave up their jobs during the week. I have only got a week to to with my job but I don't think I will bother turning up for it on Tuesday. It is so easy to find work here that I should find something better within a few days.

                Federation Day. We decided to go sight-seeing. We got the train into Sydney and then got onto a boat from Circular Quay to Darlinig Harbour. We had lunch at Darling Harbour and then spent the rest of the afternoon in a nearby pub. In the evening, we went to a few more pubs and then went for a meal at a B.Y.O. restaurant in China Town. We returned to Bondi and spent a couple of hours in The Bondi Hotel.

                Another boring week looking for work. There is lots of work about but we are missing out on a lot of agency work because we are not on the phone. I had an interview with the police department on Friday for a job fitting radios into police cars. I just missed out on the job but have to ring back next week to see if there are any more vacancies. Jane and Linda both start work on Monday. They have packing jobs at The Body Shop.

                Spent the day job hunting again. It is frustrating not being able to find work when there seems to be so many jobs around. The C.E.S. wont give out most of their jobs to people on working visas and the job agencies don't seem much use as we don't have a phone. I am now relying heavily on getting the job with the police department. We had a postcard from Darwin from Roz. She is going to Adelaide and should get here in a few weeks. Dave has fallen in love again and is heading back to Perth.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 17th October</span>
                I gave up job hunting at about 9:30 after a brief visit to Bondi Junction C.E.S. I had a letter from Paul at the post office saying he would be here in the next couple of days and then returned to the house to find him already there. He had bought a bag of grass with him so we got stoned and spent the afternoon in The Bondi Hotel.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Jane and Linda came back from work and told me I could have a job at the place where they work if I don't get the job with the police. Spent the rest of the day celebrating.

The interview lasted about five minutes and I was told straight away that I could start next Monday. The job looks pretty boring but there seems to be a good crowd of people working there.

When I got home in the evening, there was a note telling me to contact the police department about the job I went for a couple of weeks ago.

                I started my fourteenth job since getting to Australia. The job would be quite interesting if there was more to do but apart from about ten minutes work, I spent the whole day standing around doing nothing. The money is ridiculous considering what I actually do  - $426.80 for a 32½ hour week.

                I'd become bored of sitting around in the house so went back to work. I got paid $600. In the evening, we watched The Sound of Music and went to The Bondi Hotel until 2:30.

                Had a slight hangover at work and left at 2:30 as I was bored. We went to The Thai Flora for a meal and then me, Linda, Roz, Paul and Ed went to the Bondi Hotel where we met Jane. We stayed in the pub until closing and then Linda and I managed to end up leaving the pub with some bloke who invited us round for drinks. We eventually got back at around 5.

                We woke at about midday and decided to start on the session straight away. We drove to Coogee for a drink (me, Linda, Roz and Ed) and stopped for a drink in Randwick on the way home. We spent what was left of the afternoon drinking in the flat. In the evening, Jane and Paul went to see The Ramones, Gordon went to work and Linda had an early night so me, Roz and Ed went to The Bondi Hotel and stayed until it shut. When we got home, Roz and I stayed up all night while Ed slept for a couple of hours. By about 6am, Ed had recovered and Linda joined us for a quick game of chase the ace.

                This got us all drunk pretty quickly and at about 8, I can vaguely remember going to McDonalds in Bondi Junction for breakfast (except Roz who was unconscious). I eventually got to sleep at about 11:30am and slept for about five hours. In the evening we went out for a curry and had an early night.
