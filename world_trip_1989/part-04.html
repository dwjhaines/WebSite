                The flight was quite good with plenty of free drink. We arrived at about 6:30 Sydney Time and after clearing customs, we caught a bus into Sydney centre. From there we got a taxi to Bondi where we hoped to stay with Dai Hughes and Clair (Ex Clynians whose address we had been given by Liz). We hadn't warned them that we were coming but luckily they were in and we were told to stay as long as we wanted. We were also fortunate in that they were having a party tonight and we all ended up getting pissed. At 3am I phoned Gareth to find out the rugby results.

                Woke at 10 with a hangover. Paul went to Bondi Beach for the day with  while Dave,Ed and I went sight-seeing around Sydney (Opera House, Bridge, McDonalds, etc). We went on a boat trip round the harbour to Manley and back and then returned to Bondi which is quite nice apart from the amount of sewerage floating around in the sea. We went out for a drink at about 9 but apart from that, had a quiet night.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 6th March</span>
                Dave and I left at 8:30 to hitch to Perth. We took a combination of bus and trains and arrived at Waterfall by 10:30. We planned to hitch to Adelaide via Melbourne and set off down the Princess Highway along the coast.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">
                Sydney (Waterfall) &#x2192; Wollongong &#x2192; Dapto &#x2192; Kiama &#x2192; Nowra &#x2192; Tomerong &#x2192; Milton &#x2192; Ulladulla &#x2192; Bateman's Bay &#x2192; Melbourne 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We soon discovered that we had chosen the wrong route! The highway we were on was little better than an English B road and was also 200km longer than the direct road. Most of the places we were dropped at, we got lifts within 20 - 30 minutes but the lifts were only about 15 - 20 miles. We had over an hour to wait at Ulladulla and by 5:30 we had only reached Bateman's Bay about 120 miles from Sydney and still over 500 miles to Melbourne. We decided to leave the coast road and head inland towards Canberra. This proved to be a good move as the first car that stopped took us all the way to Melbourne with free beer and a guided tour of Canberra en route. We were in the car for about eight hours and finally arrived in Melbourne at 2:30am. We had planned to continue hitching through the night but when we were dropped off we did not have a clue where we were or how to get on the road to Adelaide. We ended up sleeping rough on a patch of grass just off the main road.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th March</span>
                We woke at 6am after a mainly sleepless night in which I was constantly attacked by mosquitoes. We got a bus into the city and then a train out to Rockbank where we started hitching along the Western Highway towards Adelaide.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got to Ballarat by 10:30 and were still there at 2:20 so we decided to split up. Dave got a lif tbefore me but I overtook him on my way from Beaufort to Horsham during which time I decided I was getting fed up with hitch-hiking. It had taken nearly all day to go 200 miles - less than half way. I got to Nhill by about 6:30 and from there I got a lift with a nurse going all the way to Adelaide. We stopped a couple of times on the way for a beer and food and for the car to cool down. We arrived in Adelaide quite late and I went back to Sue's house where I had a much needed shower and spent the night on the lounge floor.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 8th March</span>
                I decided to have a day of traveling as I had been invited to stay as long as I liked at Sue's. She took me to a chemist in the morning to get me cream and tablets for the tropical skin fungus I have on my leg. I spent most of the day sitting around listening to tapes but I did have a brief tour of the city of Adelaide. In the evening, we were joined by Sally, Sue's housemate and some bloke called Damion who was a bit weird and we had a huge dinner of roast lamb (with plenty of beer and wine).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 9th March</span>
                The day started off pretty well and I was in Port Augusta by 2.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">
                Adelaide &#x2192; Two Wells &#x2192; Port Augusta &#x2192; Port Augusta + 25km &#x2192; Kimba &#x2192; Kyancutta 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                However, when I got there, it was pouring with rain and I also began to realise how difficult the last 1500 miles was going to be. I finally got a lift 25km up the road where I met a bloke, originally form Glasgow, also heading for Perth. I had been in Port Augusta for six hours by this time and was getting well pissed off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Me and Mike got a lift as far as Kimba where we sat in a pub and had a couple of beers while he told me about his time spent with Bhuddist monks. We left the bar at 10:30 and were looking for somewhere to crash out for the night when we got a lift in the back of a pick-up truck. We were given a joint by the passenger and we lay in the back looking at the stars.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped at Kyancutta at 12:30 and sat by a load of grain silos watching a fantastic electrical storm. This however turned into torrential rain and we had to spend the night in a bat-filled barn.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 10th March</span>
                We woke at 7:30 and started hitching straight away.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">
                Kyancutta &#x2192; Wuddina &#x2192; Norseman

            <p class="diary-text">
                We split up at about 9:30 and I was still there at 11:30 when I finally got a lift ten miles up the road to Wudinna. At about 1:30, a car towing a caravan stopped and offered me a lift to Norseman, 900 miles away, the other side of the Nullarbor Plain. The bloke was traveling, with his girlfriend in another car to Albany, W.A. I later discovered his name was David Haines! We stopped in just about every town we came to which made the going a bit slow but we eventually arrived at Nundroo where we spent the night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Dave and Monique, his girlfriend slept in the back of her car so I had a bed in the caravan for the night.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th March</span>
                We spent all day driving, again with frequent stops. The scenery was pretty flat and uninteresting but some of it was quite good including a brief look at the The Great Australian Bight.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had hoped to reach Norseman by nightfall but ended up 400km short at Caiguna. Again, I slept in the caravan. In the road house in Caiguna, I bumped into a couple who are also hitching to Perth who I have now met four times on the journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th March</span>
                Thankfully, we woke early and were on the road again by 6:30. There was only one town in between Caiguna and Norseman so we made quite good time and arrived in Norseman at 12:30pm.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                At this point, Dave and Monique turned off Highway 1 and headed South so it was time to start hitching again. I had a wait of about an hour and a half before getting a lift, less time than I expected.
            </p>
            <p class="hitching-text">
                Norseman &#x2192; Kanbaldo &#x2192; Kellerberrin &#x2192; Perth
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The lift took me about 80 miles up the road and left me in the middle of nowhere, 36 miles from the next town, Coolgardie. It seemed pointless standing where I was so I started walking. I had got about two miles when a truck stopped. I thought I had a lift all the way to Perth but the driver made me get out at Kellerberrin as he was not supposed to carry passengers. I thought I was going to get stuck there for the night, which was frustrating as I was only about 120 miles from Perth, but at about 10pm, I had a lift that took me all the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I arrived in Perth at about 12:30 to find that all the hostels were shut and after walking about for a couple of hours, I decided to spend the night in a park.
