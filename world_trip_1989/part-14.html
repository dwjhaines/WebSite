                We got up at 6:30, packed, had a final roti telur for breakfast and caught a taxi to the jetty in time for the 8am boat back to Kuala Perlis. From there, we cleared Malaysian customs and boarded a long-tail boat to take us up the coast into Thailand. The boat was an old-fashioned type long-tail boat with a huge lorry engine on the back driving a propeller on a long shaft. the two hour journey was one of the best boat rides I have been on.

                We reached Thai immigration where Roz, Dave and I had to get off the boat to fill in a load of forms while all the locals waited patiently on board. We stayed on the boat after most people had got off and got taken a couple of miles up a river. At this point, we didn't have a clue where we were going, we had no Thai money and there was no sign of civilisation in sight. More by luck than judgement, we eventually arrived in Satun which was a surprisingly large town with banks, etc
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We wanted to get a bus to Phuket or as close to Phuket as possible. Just after midday, we caught a public bus to Trang, a distance of 150km and a three and half hour journey that seemed to take a lot longer. At Trang there was a connecting bus to Krabi and we were just about to get on it when Roz realised she had left her bag on the previous bus. Dave took our rucksacks back out of the luggage compartment while Roz and I leapt into a tuk-tuk which went racing up the road after the bus with the bag. We caught up with it after a few minutes, the driver handed me the bag and we raced back to the bus station where the Krabi bus was waiting for us. We put our luggage on again and the bus left about five minutes late. Exciting stuff!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus journey was the worst since leaving Indonesia. The bus must have had over 100 people on it a lot of the way, half of them seemed to be carrying packages of fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Krabi at about 7 after already deciding we would go no further. We were met at the bus stop by a woman who ran a hotel just over the road so we went with her and checked into two rooms for under £2.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had much needed drinks, showers and meals and spent most of the evening discussing our plans for the next few days.

                We left the hotel after breakfast at about 9:15 and got a tuk-tuk to the bus station. We caught the 10am air-conditioned bus to Phang-nga and arrived there at 11:30. We wanted to go to the harbour to go on a boat trip around Phang-nga Bay. We left our rucksacks at the bus station and eventually managed to get on a mini-bus going out to the jetty. The bus journey took ages as we kept stopping to pick up sacks of sugar, ice, fish, etc, etc and then deliver them on the way. We got to the jetty by 12:30 and chartered a boat for B450 (£1 = B48) for a three hour trip. The trip was pretty spectacualar. We were taken around loads of islands, most of which were just outcrops of limestone sticking out of the water. We saw "James Bond Island" where part of The Man With The Golden Gun was filmed as well as Nail Island, also from the film.

                We were also taken to the Muslim village on stilts for lunch (although we did not actually eat anything due to the prices). The trip ended by 3 so we caught the bus back to the bus station, picked up our rucksacks and got the 3:30 public bus to Phuket. We arrived in Phuket Town at about 5:30 and checked into a hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another excellent meal at a restaurant just across the road from the hotel and then went round the travel agencies trying to find out details of buses to Bangkok. Had an early night.

                We went to breakfast and to book V.I.P. bus tickets to Bangkok for Sunday and spent the morning lying around in the hotel room. We checked out at 11 and walked to the local bus station. A local who was obviously an agent for some of the beach hotels got us a cheap mini-bus to Karon Beach and showed us to the Crystal Beach Hotel. We were shown to a room that seemed far too nice for us - en-suite bathroom, carpet, fridge, drinks cabinet, etc. Due to it being the low season and the fact that we are staying four nights, we were told that we could have the room for B250 (about £1.60 each) per night. It seemed too good to be true. We went out to look at some beach bungalows in case there was something better but soon returned to the first place and got the price down to B200. We spent about an hour in the room before going down to the beach, about a two minute walk. The beach was OK, slightly spoilt by the fact that it was too dangerous to swim in the sea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours on the beach - long enough to turn red. We walked back to the hotel stocking up with soft drinks and Mekhong whiskey on the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Before going out for tea, we started on the second litre of Southern Comfort. We went for a meal at a restaurant about half a mile along the beach from where we are staying. Once again, the food was superb. So far the food in Thailand has been better than anywhere else. We tried a bottle of Mekhong with our meal - mixed with coke it seemed remarkably similar to Metaxa.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We continued drinking back at the hotel but went to bed without really getting drunk.

                We had tickets booked today to go on a snorkeling trip to "Coral Island". We were picked up from the hotel by bus full of tourists and driven to the port about ten miles away. We then had a 45 minute boat ride to the island and another long-tail boat ride to get us all to the beach. We spent the morning snorkeling, sun-bathing and generally burning.

                Included in the trip was a seafood lunch which was alright but nothing spectacular. I had to lie in the shade for most of the afternoon. We left the island at 3 and were dropped back at the hotel just after 4. This was probably the most touristy thing we have done yet but it was a good day out nevertheless. In the evening, we finished the Southern Comfort and a couple of bottles of Mekhong. I don't remember going to bed.

                None of us felt like going to the beach so we went to one of the big hotels and paid B100 to use their swimming pool for the day. In the evening, we decided to try and get to Patong, the next resort up the coast, about four miles away. We started walking just before 8 and managed to hitch a lift after about five minutes. Patong is a much bigger resort than Karon with more shops, restaurants, etc. We had chicken curry for tea and then wandered around the shops buying t-shirts before hitching back to Karon. Again, we got a lift almost immedeatly, this time in an ambulance.

                We had breakfast at 8 and then spent the whole morning sitting in the hotel room before checking out at midday. We caught a bus into Phuket Town and then spent another couple of hours sitting doing nothing in a restaurant. We left there at 3 and walked to the bus station where we boarded our "V.I.P." bus to Bangkok. The bus was pretty good  with air-con, plenty of leg-room, drinks and two meals along the way.

                We arrived in Bangkok just after 6 and caught a motorised rickshaw type thing to Banglamphu. We looked at a few guest houses before settling on the one that Roz, Tim and Linda had stayed in the last time they were here. We went for breakfast and then set off to book our tickets to Burma and Bangladesh. The first ticket agency we went to informed us that tourists could no longer enter Burma (now called Myanmar) unless on a package tour which costs $275 plus air fare. Another place told us that we would have to pay a lot extra for flights as the tour lasts 8 days and we would have to fly in and out of Burma with different airlines. Most places we went to didn't have a clue what they were talking about so by about midday we still didn't know what we were going to do. We all wanted to go to Burma but the cost of $600 (including air fares and visas) and the fact that we had to go on the package tour was putting us all off the idea. At the time, $600 was about half of the money I have left. As well as the financial problem, there seemed to be a problem with getting all three visas. We would have to get our own for Bangladsh, the agent that booked the tour had to get the Burmese ones and the agent that we wanted to book our tickets with didn't seem sure if she could get us visas for India. The only thing that we successfully achieved all morning was the buying of fake I.S.I.C. cards.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By lunchtime we had given up on the idea of Burma and decided on a slight change of plan. By flying to Colombo, we could have a week in Sri Lanka before flying into India at Madras. This made the flights cheaper, meant we didn't need to book a package tour and also only requires us to get one visa.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went round a few places to find out prices, times, etc and found that most places seemed to be in agreement about everything. We decided on a flight on a week on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I spent part of the afternoon wandering around the shops buying clothes and a travel guide to India.

                We spent the morning applying for Indian visas. We first had to get a bus to the British Embassy to get letters of recommendation (a complete rip off - £5 for a sheet of paper) and then a tuk-tuk to the Indian Embassy. The Indian Embassy seemed a lot more efficient than the British one and we were only in there for about 15 - 20 minutes. We handed over our passports, application forms and £40 each (another rip off) and then caught a bus towards the post office. We stopped for lunch on the way and eventually found our way to the post office by about 2. We collected our mail (one letter from home), posted our cards, letters, etc and then phoned the Sri Lanka Embassy to check that it was safe to enter the country.

                All this done, we got a boat back to Bamglamphu and then went round booking various tickets. We reserved our plane tickets though didn't actually pay for them or receive any proof of the reservation. We also booked bus tickets to Chang Mai for Thursday night and tickets for a "3 in 1" tour for tomorrow.

                We got up at 6, had breakfast and started the tour at 6:45. We were driven round in an air-conditioned minibus first to an orchid/butterfly farm and then to a floating market neither of which were particularly exciting. We were taken from there to Knachanaburi the place where The Bridge on the River Kwai was buit and still stands. We went to a museum first then on to a war cemetary and then on to the bridge itself. We had lunch in a restaurant overlooking the bridge and then had about half an hour of walking over the bridge taking photos, etc. The last stop on the way back was at the world's tallest pagoda.

                After breakfast, Dave and I went to see the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Keo. Roz having seen them on her last visit, went shopping.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It took ages to get into the Palace grounds as we first of all walked all the way round the perimiter wall and then went to a different wat (they all look the same). When we finally found the entrance, we were told that we couldn't go in wearing shorts so we had to hire long trousers from a shop keeper over the road.

                At 12, we checked out of the hotel. We left our rucksacks at the hotel and started heading in the direction of the Indian Embassy where we had to pick up our visas at 4:30. We caught a boat to the post office to check mail again and then walked to Patong, Bangkok's red light area. We got shown into one of the "pussy ping pong" shows where we stayed for a few minutes before deciding to come back next week.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch at McDonalds and then went to another McDonalds closer to the embassy to kill time. We caught a bus to the embassy and picked up our passports and visas without too many problems at 4:45. We got back to Banglamphu at about 6 and Dave took money out on his visa card to pay for our airline tickets. After sorting them out, we collected our rucksacks, went for a meal and went to wait for a 7:30 bus to Chiang Mai. We were taken by minibus to the bus station where we boarded an air-conditioned us. The bus was totally full but the journey was made entertaining by the hostess who spent her time making sure everyone was in their correct seat and generally treating us all like kids on a school trip.

                The bus broke down at about 6:30 and we eventually got into Chiang Mai just after 9. We were met at the bus station by someone from Chan Chai House where we had a free night's accommodation booked with our bus tickets. We had expected the accommodation to be pretty grotty but when we arrived there, it was all quite new and we had a really good room with our own shower. We had breakfast and were shown details of the trek done from the guest house. It looked pretty good value - B1400 for four days and three nights though we decided to check on some other places before making any decisions. We walked into town and went round a few travel agents but couldn't find anything as good as the first trek we had seen. We went and had lunch and then walked back. By this time I had got a headache.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We booked ourselves on the trek for tomorrow and also booked bus tickets back to Khao San Road for Tuesday night.

                After we had done that, I had to go and lie down. By the end of the afternoon, I had a worse headache, a high temperature and was lying in bed shivering. Stayed in bed for the rest of the day.

                When I woke, it was immedeatly obvious I wasn't going to be able to go on the trek. It was an effort to get out of bed. Sunny, the tour guide took me to a doctor on the back of his motor-bike but I was told to come back later. We cancelled the trek and I went back to bed. We all went back to the doctors by tuk-tuk at 9:30 and after various tests for Dengue fever, he told me that I had the flu. He gave me a bag of tablets - three different types - and told me I had to take 18 a day including ten painkillers. We returned to the hotel and I spent most of the day in bed again. The tablets made me feel sick.

                Not much improvement. Roz and Dave had a disagreement over breakfast and spent most of the day in seperate rooms though they had sorted it out by the evening. I felt sick all day and finally threw up in the evening. We went out for tea and I managed about half a taco.

                I felt a bit better. In the afternoon, we decided to hire a car and go up to The Golden Triangle. We were given a 4WD Jeep for 24 hours for B950. We set off at 2 and, after getting lost a couple of times, taking a 50km short cut along a road not much better than a farm track and stopping for a meal, we got to within about 35km of The Golden Triangle by 10pm. By this time we were all pretty tired so we stopped at a place with cabin type rooms for the night.

                We got up at 6 and drove to the bridge where you can walk into Burma (if you are a Thai or Burmese). We went right up to the border before being turned away. At least we have seen Burma!

                We went for breakfast at a guest house. I appeared to have a relapse and spent most of the time lying in the jeep. We continued on to The Golden Triangle where you can see into both Burma and Laos. After taking photos, admiring the views, etc, we set off back towards Chiang Mai.

                Roz started feeling ill on the way back so Dave was now the only one fit to drive. Just as we were getting into Chiang Mai, he had to stop the car for first Roz and then me to be sick at the side of the road.

                When we arrived back at the guest house, we had to have a room for the afternoon so Roz and I had somewhere to go to sleep.

                Neither of us were looking forward to our bus journey back to Bangkok but by the time we reached the bus station, Roz was starting to feel better. The bus was one of the best we have been on yet - air-conditioning, reclining seats and it was less than half full. We all had a double seat to ourselves so had quite a good nights sleep. Roz had almost totally recovered by bed time.

                I woke up at 6 feeling almost 100% well again. We got taken to Khao San Road and we checked back into the Green House. We went for a much needed breakfast - I had hardly eaten for five days and was totally starving by now.

                When we went to pick up our airline tickets, we were told that the price had gone up by B400 each. We tried to rebook our tickets elsewhere but in the end had no choice but to pay the extra money.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch, went round the shops and generally killed time until picking up the tickets at 3.

                At about 4 we caught buses back to Patong. On Regan's recommendation, we wanted to go and watch one of the shows. We had a quick McDonalds and then crossed over to the street with all the clubs. We were immedeatly shown into the "Funny Girl" club where we were told we would only have to pay for £1 each for beer while we watched the show. The show was pretty boring but we stayed for about half an hour waiting for it to liven up. After this time, the manager came and presented us with a bill for our drinks, the girl's drinks, peanuts, cold towels and club membership - a total of about £30. We weren't too amused. There was a long argument during which time the bouncers locked us in, there was nearly a fight and in the end, the only way we could get out was to pay the money. Outside the club, someone saw our distress and went back in to get some of our money back but the evening still cost us £22. We caught a couple of buses back to Banglamphu and went to bed.

                We spent most of the morning lying around in the hotel, doing our last minute shopping, etc. It was Dave's turn to get the one day illness so he spent half the day being sick. I went to the post office for the last time at lunch time and picked up a letter from Dad - nothing from Jane!

                After we'd had lunch, we caught a bus out to the airport, a one and a half hour journey. We arrived at the airport just after 6 and had about four hours to kill before our flight. We eventually boarded our plane at 10 and took off at 10:30, twenty minutes late.
