                We got up at 6:30, packed, had a final roti telur for breakfast and caught a taxi to the jetty in time for the 8am boat back to Kuala Perlis. From there, we cleared Malaysian customs and boarded a long-tail boat to take us up the coast into Thailand. The boat was an old-fashioned type long-tail boat with a huge lorry engine on the back driving a propeller on a long shaft. the two hour journey was one of the best boat rides I have been on.

                We reached Thai immigration where Roz, Dave and I had to get off the boat to fill in a load of forms while all the locals waited patiently on board. We stayed on the boat after most people had got off and got taken a couple of miles up a river. At this point, we didn't have a clue where we were going, we had no Thai money and there was no sign of civilisation in sight. More by luck than judgement, we eventually arrived in Satunwhich was a surprisingly large town with banks, etc

                We wanted to get a bus to Phuket or as close to Phuket as possible. Just after midday, we caught a public bus to Trang, a distance of 150km and a three and half hour journey that seemed to take a lot longer. At Trang there was a connecting bus to Krabi and we were just about to get on it when Roz realised she had left her bag on the previous bus. Dave took our rucksacks back out of the luggage compartment while Roz and I leapt into a tuk-tuk which went racing up the road after the bus with the bag. We caught up with it after a few minutes, the driver handed me the bag and we raced back to the bus station where the Krabi bus was waiting for us. We put our luggage on againand the bus left about five minutes late. Exciting stuff!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus journey was the worst since leaving Indonesia. The bus must have had over 100 people on it a lot of the way, half of them seemed to be carrying packages of fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Krabi at about 7 after already deciding we would go no further. We were met at the bus stop by a woman who ran a hotel just over the road so we went with her and checked into two rooms for under £2.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had much needed drinks, showers and meals and spent most of the evening discussing our plans for the next few days.

                We left the hotel after breakfast at about 9:15 and got a tuk-tuk to the bus station. We caught the 10am air-conditioned bus to Phang-nga and arrived there at 11:30. We wanted to go to the harbour to go on a boat trip around Phang-nga Bay. We left our rucksacks at the bus station and eventually managed to get on a mini-bus going out to the jetty. The bus journey took ages as we kept stopping to pick up sacks of sugar, ice, fish, etc, etc and then deliver them on the way. We got to the jetty by 12:30 and chartered a boat for B450 (£1 = B48) for a three hour trip. The trip was pretty spectacualar. We were taken around loads of islands, most of which were just outcrops of limestone sticking out of the water. We saw "James Bond Island" where part of The Man With The Golden Gun was filmed as well as Nail Island, also from the film.

                We were also taken to the Muslim village on stilts for lunch (although we did not actually eat anything due to the prices). The trip ended by 3 so we caught the bus back to the bus station, picked up our rucksacks and got the 3:30 public bus to Phuket. We arrived in Phuket Town at about 5:30 and checked into a hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another excellent meal at a restaurant just across the road from the hotel and then went round the travel agencies trying to find out details of buses to Bangkok. Had an early night.

                We went to breakfast and to book V.I.P. bus tickets to Bangkok for Sunday and spent the morning lying around in the hotel room. We checked out at 11 and walked to the local bus station. A local who was obviously an agent for some of the beach hotels got us a cheap mini-bus to Karon Beach and showed us to the Crystal Beach Hotel. We were shown to a room that seemed far too nice for us - en-suite bathroom, carpet, fridge, drinks cabinet, etc. Due to it being the low season and the fact that we are staying four nights, we were told that we could have the room for B250 (about £1.60 each) per night. It seemed too good to be true. We went out to look at some beach bungalows in case there was something better but soon returned to the first place and got the price down to B200. We spent about an hour in the room before going down to the beach, about a two minute walk. The beach was OK, slightly spoilt by the fact that it was too dangerous to swim in the sea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours on the beach - long enough to turn red. We walked back to the hotel stocking up with soft drinks and Mekhong whiskey on the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Before going out for tea, we started on the second litre of Southern Comfort. We went for a meal at a restaurant about half a mile along the beach from where we are staying. Once again, the food was superb. So far the food in Thailand has been better than anywhere else. We tried a bottle of Mekhong with our meal - mixed with coke it seemed remarkably similar to Metaxa.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We continued drinking back at the hotel but went to bed without really getting drunk.
