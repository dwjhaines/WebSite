                We spent the afternoon at Trinity Beach, a beautiful stretch of tropical beach about 20km North of Cairns. I phoned home in the evening. We went out first to Magnum's Pub then to Magnum's Nightclub. It was a good night and we eventually got back in at about 3.

                I spent most of the week half-heartedly looking for work and lying about in the sun. I've not been very enthusiastic about job hunting as I have had a cold and cough for most of the week. I have now recovered and will try harder next week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather has not been too good - most days have been cloudy and windy but still warm enough for sun-bathing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Tina left us on Friday so me, Ed and Gordon went out and got drunk. We went to most of the pubs in Cairns and ended up in Magnum's again. Gordon's snoring kept half the hostel awake.

                We checked out of the hostel in the morning and set off on a driving tour of the Atherton Tableland region, just inland from Cairns. Our first stop was at Kuranda, a small village set in tropical rain-forest about 40km from Cairns. We went round the markets, saw the railway station and then spent the afternoon at a swimming hole near the Barron Creek Falls. I really liked the place and we decided to stay for a couple of nights.

                We got up at 6:50 so we could go canoing on the Barron River. We had two and a half hours on the water for $4. It was well worth getting up for. After we had had breakfast, we took the car to Barron Falls and then walked to Wright's Lookout and Surprise Creek. We spent a couple of hours climbing rocks and then walked back to Barron Falls along the scenic railway line.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch and spent the afternoon by the same swimming hole that we were at yesterday. In the evening, we visited Kuranda's two pubs - "The Top Pub" and "The Bottom Pub"

                We left the hostel just after 10 and continued driving around the Tableland region. We stopped at Mareeba and Atherton and then spent the afternoon touring round some of the many waterfalls in the area (Dinners Falls, Millaa Millaa Falls and Elinjaa Falls)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove to Malanda where I hoped to stay with Chris Cartland's brother but discovered that he had moved to Cairns. After a lot of indecision we decided to camp out near Lake Eacham.

                We finished our sight-seeing tour by walking round Lake Eacham and visiting the Curtain Fig Tree. We got back to Cairns by mid-afternoon and checked into Jimmy's Hostel again. We were all bored in the evening so we went out and got drunk. We ended up in Magnums until about 3.

            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the day recovering from last night. I tried to find Tim Cartland again. He was out but I met his wife and I'm going round for dinner next week.

                We managed to get tickets for a free cruise to Green Island. We had about three hours on the island and I had a go at snorkeling on the Barrier Reef for the first time. It was quite interesting but I found the fish more spectacular than the coral. I spent about an hour in the water and the rest of the time sun-bathing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Went to Magnum's for a meal in the evening.

                We checked out of the hostel and drove up the coast to Cape Tribulation. We stopped at Port Douglas for about an hour on the way. The road to Cape Trib was a gravel track for the last 50km and the car only just made it through some of the creeks. We arrived at The Jungle Lodge at about 3.

                We went for a walk to Cape Trip Beach. The tropical rain-forest goes right down to the beach so the scenery is quite spectacular. We spent the evning at The Jungle Lodge Bar and bumped into Dai Hughes again.

                We spent most of the day walking to beaches through the rain-forest. The whole area is beatiful with miles of totally deserted beaches. The weather was pretty bad most of the day which meant we couldn't sun-bathe anywhere.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went to the bar again and spent most of the evening playing pool and getting drunk. When the bar shut, we went down to "The Village", the Y.H.A. hostel and spent about an hour in the swimming pool. I cut my head diving into the shallow end.

                We left Cape Trib and drove back to Cairns stopping at Mossman for lunch. We decided to start camping out to save money and found a campsite at Yorkey's Knob. In the evening, I went to Tim Cartland's house where I spent about six hours getting drunk again. He is just like his brother!

                Another lazy day. In the evening, a woman came round to the hostel looking for someone to sell cakes tomorrow morning. I got the job and have to sell 600 Lemmingtons for which I will earn $50.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 28th August</span>
                Another disastrous attempt at selling. I managed to sell 90 cakes and earned about $7.50. This should just about cover petrol and food and drink for the day. I have decided to give up selling jobs of any kind. We went out for a free meal and a couple of beers at Johno's Blues Bar.

                I spent the morning looking for work without success. It is hard to show much enthusiasm for work while the weather is so hot. I would like to find a job here and stay here until Dave and Roz arrive in October, even though I would be better off going straight down to Sydney.
            </p>

                We checked out of the hostel and drove to Kuranda. We went to the Rain-forest Resort which has a back-packer hostel next to the main hotel. It is only $10 a night and you can use all the hotel facilities, swimming pools, gym, etc. We checked in for three nights and spent the rest of the day sun-bathing. We had a few beers in the evening with Brian, our room-mate.

This follows a scenic route through the rain-forest and is a pretty spectacular journey. We arrived back in Cairns at 4pm and checked into the youth hostel.

                Jane and I went on a reef trip to Michalmas Cay and Green Island. At Michalmas Cay, we went snorkeling and also had trips in a glass bottom boat and a submersible (a boat with glass sides below the water level). The coral was much better than at Green Island and the whole trip was well worth doing. The weather was pretty bad all day and most of our snorkeling was done in the rain.

Jane drove back to Cairns at about midnight and I then spent four hours at Magnum's night club with Ed. We finally got back to the hostel at 4:30.

We drove about 500km to Bowen stopping at Cardwell and Townsville on the way. We arrived at Bowen at 7 and managed to get a caravan for the night for $32.

                In the morning, I went round the city sight-seeing again. This consisted mainly of going up to the top of the City Hall Tower. At 11, Linda, Gordon, Jane and I went to the World Expo 88 site. There is an amusement park there like Disney Land but on a much smaller scale and without all the queues. We spent about two hours in there going on the rides including four goes on the roller coaster.

                We got to the outskirts of Sydney at 5:30 and then spent about two hours driving across the city and out to Coogee. We were looking for a Y.H.A. hostel that had closed down last year. Once we had discovered that it was closed, we drove back to the city and checked into the Glebe Point Y.H.A. hostel.

                We went out for a pizza and had an early night.
