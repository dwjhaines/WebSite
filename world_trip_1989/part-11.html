                We arrived in Auckland at 7:10 and eventually left for Bali at about middy. We were both quite relieved that we had both got through New Zealand customs without any awkward questions about working without permits.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight took nine hours so we landed in Bali at 5pm local time. It was the first time I had set foot in Asia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught a bemo (mini-bus type thing) into Kuta which is supposedly the equivalent of Benidorm for the Australians and New Zealanders. It was not at all how I imagined it to be, more like parts of Greece than I'd expected. We walked to the losman where Roz had stayed before to find it was full up but the owner directed us to another one just around the corner. We got a double room with bathroom for the equivalent of about £3.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a much needed shower, we went back into the centre of Kuta for a meal which cost about 80p each for a bowl of fried noodles and a drink. Everything is incredibly good value. Without drinking much, it would be quite easy to survive here on about £3 a day each. Although Kuta is the most commercialised and touristy place on Bali, I have really liked what I have seen so far.

                We were served breakfast as soon as we got up. This and as much tea as you can drink all day is included in the £3.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Kuta beach is about the best I have been on so far. It has good waves, isn't crowded and is not spoilt by hundreds of hotels. We spent about an hour on the beach before walking to Legian, the next resort along from Kuta, getting sun-burnt arms and shoulders along the way. We sat at a beach cafe at Legian for about an hour and a half before walking along the main road back to Kuta. All the way along the road, there is a non-stop succession of Indonesians hassling you to buy watches, jewelery, clothes, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We discovered a pub that was going to show a delayed telecast of the England v Belgium game so, after showering and eating, we walked back most of the way to Legian. The game was shown in the back yard of the pub with about 30 seats, mostly filled with English football fans. There was quite a good atmosphere there until the video went off just before the start of extra time. We did manage to find the final score though so were not too upset about it. It was the strangest setting I have ever watched a football match in.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th June</span>
                As we have really good cheap accommodation and are enjoying ourselves here, we decided to spend an extra day here. We have a rough three week schedule for getting to Singapore, which we will now be a day behind. As we have already changed our minds as to where we are going, this does not really matter.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the day at Kuta beach, either lying in the shade, writing postcards in the cafe or actually sun-bathing. In the evening we went back to the beach to see the sunset which Kuta is famous for. I think we must have been there on a bad night because although the sun set was good to look at, it was not as spectacular as expected.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the same restaurant that we have eaten in for the last two nights for tea (mie goreng again) and then walked back to the losman along the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 29th June</span>
                We got up early, left the losman and wlaked to Bemo Corner. We caught a bemo into Dempasar and then had to walk across the city to get another bemo to Ubud. Dempasar was a pretty nasty looking city - dirty and smelly and totally overrun by bemos and motor bikes. We caught a bemo as quickly as possible out of Dempasar, having to argue with the driver as always about the price of the journey. It is pretty cheap to get around but the bemo drivers seem to feel obliged to try and charge you twice as much as the locals.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to change at Batubulan and at the bemo station there, we met a Mr Pande. He told us the fare that we should be paying and continued talking to us on the bus. He then told us he could offer us accommodation in Ubud. He produced a visitors book from his losman that seemed to prove he was quite genuine, so we got off the bemo at his place, about 2km from Ubud town centre. We were shown two rooms. I rejected the first one at 8000Rp as I didn't think it had a bathroom (though it turned out to have one) so we got charged 10,000 for a slightly bigger one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showering and the inevitable cup of tea, we set off to start our sight-seeing. We started walking towards Pejeng about four miles away. About we got given a lift by a local with a pick-up. I sat in the back while Roz was chatted up by the driver. I enjoyed the walk/drive through rice fields, seeing the real Balinese people for the first time instead of the ones who just want to rip you off all the time in Kuta.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Pejeng, we looked round a temple which was pretty boring and then caught a bemo to Tampaksiring where we went to Gunung Kawi - a temple in the paddy fields. The temple wasn't nearly as impressive as the setting - supposedly one of the best views in Bali.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught another bemo half way back to Ubud and were given a lift the rest of the way by another friendly local.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we walked into Ubud - which is much nicer and quieter than Kuta, and found a restaurant for our evening meal. We decided to try a bottle of the local palm wine. It was  pretty nasty but, like retsina, it improved greatly with the addition of lemonade and the quantity consumed. After our first taste, we had doubts as to whether or not we would finish the bottle but we managed to get through it by 9:30 so had another bottle as well. It was stronger than normal wine and I can't remember coming home.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th June</span>
                We stayed in Ubud an extra day so that we could go and watch a cremation. It was a surprisingly good day out. The funerals over here are happy occasions as opposed to sad ones so there was much celebrating, music playing, etc. The highlight was the cremation tower being carried to the cremation followed by all the members of the community making as much noise as possible to confuse the soul. We watched the body being burned and then returned to Ubud.

                Back at the Losman, Mr Pande made a desperate last attempt to sell us tickets for Balinese dancing, something that neither of us had any desire to go and see. We instead went for a walk through Ubud in the evening and were laughed at by the waitresses where we had our meal last night. By the time we had finished eating (about 8 o'clock), I wass totally worn out, I think from a combination of last nights session and the amount of walking we have done. I was asleep by about 9.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 1st July</span>
                We left Ubud just after 8am after a breakfast of fruit salad and two black rice puddings. We caugth a bemo into Batubulan where we expected to catch another to Ubung before getting a bus to Singaraja (We had planned to go to Batur or Bedugal for a couple of days but as we are already two days behind schedule, decided to go straight to Singaraja). We were told at Batubulan that we could get a bus direct to Singaraja so we got on before realising that although the bus did go all the way, it was hardly a direct route. However, we stayed on the bus and quite enjoyed the four hour journey which took us via Batur.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The other passengers on the bus seemed as interested in us as we were in the scenery. Lake Batur looked quite spectacular but there didn't seem a lot to do there so although it was nice to see, I was glad we decided not to stay.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Singaraja at about 1:30 and caught a bemo to Kalibukbuk, the nearest village to Lavina Beach. We checked into a Losman right where the bemo dropped us and were given the cheapest room we have found yet - Rp4,500 (about £1.50). We dropped our stuff in the room and went straight down to the beach. The beach was much quieter than Kuta but seemed to have the same number of people trying to sell us things we didn't want. We spent a couple of hours on the beach though it was pretty cloudy so there hasn't been a great change in our tans. We went to a beach restaurant for fruit drinks and then walked back to the losman finding a bar that was going to show England v Cameroon live tonight. We had a snack when we returned and then spent a couple of hours trying to sort out our travel plans for the next coupleo of weeks. It is very difficult to get any sort of timetable information for transport on Bali let alone the other islands, and our plans are further complicated by not beong able to travel overnihgt when England may be playing in the World Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a meal at about 9:30 and then walked back along the beach to the losman where we had been told that we could see the football. We decided to watch the football at the losman instead of the bar and were shown to an ancient television set in the owner of the losman's living room. The room was fully furnished but had no outside walls so it was like being on a huge verandah. We watched the first game at 11 , went to bed for two hours and then returned at 3 for the England game. We were the only two people watching either game and again, it was strange watching live football from Italy with English commentary. England won 3 - 2 so we now have to worry about where we are going to be for the semi! Finally got to bed at 5:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 2nd July</span>
                We woke at about 9:30 and after breakfast, headed for the beach. On the way we went to tourist info to try and find bus times to Gilimanuk, where we catch a boat to Java. The bloke there didn't seem to know anything and told ud that there was one bus per day at 10am contradicting what we had been told at the losman - 3 per day at 7, 9, 11!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked to the beach and then apparently spent too loong in the sun as I ended up getting burnt and Roz got a slight case of sun-stroke. Roz spent the afternoon sleeping while I sat in the shade reading a book.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we were told of a bus which left at 7 and would take us to the port at Gilimanuk for Rp4,000. This seemed quite reasonable at the time so we paid our money. We went for a meal and then a romantic walk and lie down on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had an early night due to being knackered from last night and tomorrows early start.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 3rd July</span>
                The day got off to an amusing start when Roz stuck her finger in an electric light socket looking for the switch. The scream woke half of Lovina up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught the bus at 7am. we had been told that it was a special bus going non-stop to Gilimanuk but turned out to be a normal bus stopping everywhere en-route and not going all the way to the port. By the time we had discovered this, Roz was not at all happy at being ripped off again and started talking about flying home from Jakarta. However, the walk to the ferry terminal was only about 5 - 10 minutes and we got straight onto a boat going to Java. The crossing only lasted about 15 minutes and as soon as we left the port, after the inevitable bemo driver trying to get us to go somewhere else, we got straight onto a bus to Probolinggo. The bus journey cost Rp2,200 and although the bus was packed, was not too bad. There was no air-conditioning on the bus but we had seats right by the back door which was open for most of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we arrived in Probolinggo, after a four hour journey we set off in search of the bemo station which was supposed to be 300m away according to the book. We walked about half a mile before having to stop for a drink and then caught a bechak - a push bike with three wheels and a seat on the front - to the bemo station via the railway station due to communication difficulties. We had a two hour bemo journey to Ngadisari, a small village 2.5km from the top of Mt Bromo which was where we were planning to go to. The road up from Ngadisari is too steep for the bemo so we had to get a jeep up to the top for another Rp1,000, We checked into a losman at the top and were served by an Indonesian who spoke perfect English with a broad cockney accent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Mt Bromo is a really nice place to stay. We are staying on the top of a huge crater rim which has another crater which is volcanic and constantly smoking inside it. The views from where we are staying made the days traveling worthwhile and seemed to change Roz's mind about going home! Because we are so much higher up here, it is a lot cooler and it is quite nice having to put a jumper to go out for the first time since leaving N.Z.
