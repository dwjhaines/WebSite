                We arrived in Auckland at 7:10 and eventually left for Bali at about middy. We were both quite relieved that we had both got through New Zealand customs without any awkward questions about working without permits.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight took nine hours so we landed in Bali at 5pm local time. It was the first time I had set foot in Asia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught a bemo (mini-bus type thing) into Kuta which is supposedly the equivalent of Benidorm for the Australians and New Zealanders. It was not at all how I imagined it to be, more like parts of Greece than I'd expected. We walked to the losman where Roz had stayed before to find it was full up but the owner directed us to another one just around the corner. We got a double room with bathroom for the equivalent of about £3.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a much needed shower, we went back into the centre of Kuta for a meal which cost about 80p each for a bowl of fried noodles and a drink. Everything is incredibly good value. Without drinking much, it would be quite easy to survive here on about £3 a day each. Although Kuta is the most commercialised and touristy place on Bali, I have really liked what I have seen so far.

                We were served breakfast as soon as we got up. This and as much tea as you can drink all day is included in the £3.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Kuta beach is about the best I have been on so far. It has good waves, isn't crowded and is not spoilt by hundreds of hotels. We spent about an hour on the beach before walking to Legian, the next resort along from Kuta, getting sun-burnt arms and shoulders along the way. We sat at a beach cafe at Legian for about an hour and a half before walking along the main road back to Kuta. All the way along the road, there is a non-stop succession of Indonesians hassling you to buy watches, jewelery, clothes, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We discovered a pub that was going to show a delayed telecast of the England v Belgium game so, after showering and eating, we walked back most of the way to Legian. The game was shown in the back yard of the pub with about 30 seats, mostly filled with English football fans. There was quite a good atmosphere there until the video went off just before the start of extra time. We did manage to find the final score though so were not too upset about it. It was the strangest setting I have ever watched a football match in.

                As we have really good cheap accommodation and are enjoying ourselves here, we decided to spend an extra day here. We have a rough three week schedule for getting to Singapore, which we will now be a day behind. As we have already changed our minds as to where we are going, this does not really matter.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the day at Kuta beach, either lying in the shade, writing postcards in the cafe or actually sun-bathing. In the evening we went back to the beach to see the sunset which Kuta is famous for. I think we must have been there on a bad night because although the sun set was good to look at, it was not as spectacular as expected.

                We returned to the same restaurant that we have eaten in for the last two nights for tea (mie goreng again) and then walked back to the losman along the beach.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 29th June</span>
                We got up early, left the losman and wlaked to Bemo Corner. We caught a bemo into Dempasar and then had to walk across the city to get another bemo to Ubud. Dempasar was a pretty nasty looking city - dirty and smelly and totally overrun by bemos and motor bikes. We caught a bemo as quickly as possible out of Dempasar, having to argue with the driver as always about the price of the journey. It is pretty cheap to get around but the bemo drivers seem to feel obliged to try and charge you twice as much as the locals.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to change at Batubulan and at the bemo station there, we met a Mr Pande. He told us the fare that we should be paying and continued talking to us on the bus. He then told us he could offer us accommodation in Ubud. He produced a visitors book from his losman that seemed to prove he was quite genuine, so we got off the bemo at his place, about 2km from Ubud town centre. We were shown two rooms. I rejected the first one at 8000Rp as I didn't think it had a bathroom (though it turned out to have one) so we got charged 10,000 for a slightly bigger one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showering and the inevitable cup of tea, we set off to start our sight-seeing. We started walking towards Pejeng about four miles away. About we got given a lift by a local with a pick-up. I sat in the back while Roz was chatted up by the driver. I enjoyed the walk/drive through rice fields, seeing the real Balinese people for the first time instead of the ones who just want to rip you off all the time in Kuta.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Pejeng, we looked round a temple which was pretty boring and then caught a bemo to Tampaksiring where we went to Gunung Kawi - a temple in the paddy fields. The temple wasn't nearly as impressive as the setting - supposedly one of the best views in Bali.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught another bemo half way back to Ubud and were given a lift the rest of the way by another friendly local.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we walked into Ubud - which is much nicer and quieter than Kuta, and found a restaurant for our evening meal. We decided to try a bottle of the local palm wine. It was  pretty nasty but, like retsina, it improved greatly with the addition of lemonade and the quantity consumed. After our first taste, we had doubts as to whether or not we would finish the bottle but we managed to get through it by 9:30 so had another bottle as well. It was stronger than normal wine and I can't remember coming home.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th June</span>
                We stayed in Ubud an extra day so that we could go and watch a cremation. It was a surprisingly good day out. The funerals over here are happy occasions as opposed to sad ones so there was much celebrating, music playing, etc. The highlight was the cremation tower being carried to the cremation followed by all the members of the community making as much noise as possible to confuse the soul. We watched the body being burned and then returned to Ubud.

                Back at the Losman, Mr Pande made a desperate last attempt to sell us tickets for Balinese dancing, something that neither of us had any desire to go and see. We instead went for a walk through Ubud in the evening and were laughed at by the waitresses where we had our meal last night. By the time we had finished eating (about 8 o'clock), I was totally worn out, I think from a combination of last nights session and the amount of walking we have done. I was asleep by about 9.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 1st July</span>
                We left Ubud just after 8am after a breakfast of fruit salad and two black rice puddings. We caught a bemo into Batubulan where we expected to catch another to Ubung before getting a bus to Singaraja (We had planned to go to Batur or Bedugal for a couple of days but as we are already two days behind schedule, decided to go straight to Singaraja). We were told at Batubulan that we could get a bus direct to Singaraja so we got on before realising that although the bus did go all the way, it was hardly a direct route. However, we stayed on the bus and quite enjoyed the four hour journey which took us via Batur.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The other passengers on the bus seemed as interested in us as we were in the scenery. Lake Batur looked quite spectacular but there didn't seem a lot to do there so although it was nice to see, I was glad we decided not to stay.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Singaraja at about 1:30 and caught a bemo to Kalibukbuk, the nearest village to Lavina Beach. We checked into a Losman right where the bemo dropped us and were given the cheapest room we have found yet - Rp4,500 (about £1.50). We dropped our stuff in the room and went straight down to the beach. The beach was much quieter than Kuta but seemed to have the same number of people trying to sell us things we didn't want. We spent a couple of hours on the beach though it was pretty cloudy so there hasn't been a great change in our tans. We went to a beach restaurant for fruit drinks and then walked back to the losman finding a bar that was going to show England v Cameroon live tonight. We had a snack when we returned and then spent a couple of hours trying to sort out our travel plans for the next couple of weeks. It is very difficult to get any sort of timetable information for transport on Bali let alone the other islands, and our plans are further complicated by not beong able to travel overnight when England may be playing in the World Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a meal at about 9:30 and then walked back along the beach to the losman where we had been told that we could see the football. We decided to watch the football at the losman instead of the bar and were shown to an ancient television set in the owner of the losman's living room. The room was fully furnished but had no outside walls so it was like being on a huge varandah. We watched the first game at 11 , went to bed for two hours and then returned at 3 for the England game. We were the only two people watching either game and again, it was strange watching live football from Italy with English commentary. England won 3 - 2 so we now have to worry about where we are going to be for the semi! Finally got to bed at 5:30.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 2nd July</span>
                We woke at about 9:30 and after breakfast, headed for the beach. On the way we went to tourist info to try and find bus times to Gilimanuk, where we catch a boat to Java. The bloke there didn't seem to know anything and told ud that there was one bus per day at 10am contradicting what we had been told at the losman - 3 per day at 7, 9, 11!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked to the beach and then apparently spent too long in the sun as I ended up getting burnt and Roz got a slight case of sun-stroke. Roz spent the afternoon sleeping while I sat in the shade reading a book.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we were told of a bus which left at 7 and would take us to the port at Gilimanuk for Rp4,000. This seemed quite reasonable at the time so we paid our money. We went for a meal and then a romantic walk and lie down on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had an early night due to being knackered from last night and tomorrows early start.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 3rd July</span>
                The day got off to an amusing start when Roz stuck her finger in an electric light socket looking for the switch. The scream woke half of Lovina up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught the bus at 7am. we had been told that it was a special bus going non-stop to Gilimanuk but turned out to be a normal bus stopping everywhere en-route and not going all the way to the port. By the time we had discovered this, Roz was not at all happy at being ripped off again and started talking about flying home from Jakarta. However, the walk to the ferry terminal was only about 5 - 10 minutes and we got straight onto a boat going to Java. The crossing only lasted about 15 minutes and as soon as we left the port, after the inevitable bemo driver trying to get us to go somewhere else, we got straight onto a bus to Probolinggo. The bus journey cost Rp2,200 and although the bus was packed, was not too bad. There was no air-conditioning on the bus but we had seats right by the back door which was open for most of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we arrived in Probolinggo, after a four hour journey we set off in search of the bemo station which was supposed to be 300m away according to the book. We walked about half a mile before having to stop for a drink and then caught a bechak - a push bike with three wheels and a seat on the front - to the bemo station via the railway station due to communication difficulties. We had a two hour bemo journey to Ngadisari, a small village 2.5km from the top of Mt Bromo which was where we were planning to go to. The road up from Ngadisari is too steep for the bemo so we had to get a jeep up to the top for another Rp1,000, We checked into a losman at the top and were served by an Indonesian who spoke perfect English with a broad cockney accent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Mt Bromo is a really nice place to stay. We are staying on the top of a huge crater rim which has another crater which is volcanic and constantly smoking inside it. The views from where we are staying made the days traveling worthwhile and seemed to change Roz's mind about going home! Because we are so much higher up here, it is a lot cooler and it is quite nice having to put a jumper to go out for the first time since leaving N.Z.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a brief walk around and a much needed wash we went out for our evening meal at a nearby cafe. Had an early night. (when checking in, we booked ourselves on a bus to Yogya for tomorrow afternoon at a cost of Rp9,000 each)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 4th July</span>
                We were up at 3:30 for the trip to the centre crater to watch the sun rise. After a hurried breakfast, we stumbled down the path from our losman to join the main track to the crater centre. We walked in total darkness except for Roz's torch and the headlights from the occasional passing jeep. It seemed that most people were getting to the centre by jeep or on horseback. The walk took about 50 minutes and was quite enjoyable as the night sky was as good as I have ever seen it.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about one and a half hours at the top watching the sun rise and I walked all the way round the rim of the crater. The views of the sin rise over the outer crater, the area around Mt Bromo and the inside of the smoking volcano itself were some of the most spectacular I have ever seen. After the walk back to the losman (by which time Roz was getting tired) we had a second more leisurely breakfast and sorted out our bus tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the hotel at about 9 and walked the 2.5km downhill to Ngadisari. We sat in a cafe for a while before getting a relatively empty bemo back down to Probolinggo. We had a short walk to the office from where our bus departs and arrived there about two hours before it was due to leave.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus turned up on time but was totally full. We were told we could get on the next one at 3:30 but this one failed to appear "due to a breakdown". We were given our money back and told to get a bemo back to Probolinggo bus terminal and get a bus from there. Instead of doing this, we flagged down a public bus to Surabaya so at least we were heading in the right direction.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus journey was incredible. As usual the bus was packed and we were lucky to be sitting on the engine compartment at the front next to the driver. This was both hot and uncomfortable and it gave us a close up view of the drivers suicidal overtaking maneuvers. It seemed that as soon as there was any possibility of getting past something, the driver would go for it relying heavily on the conductor, who was hanging out of the front door to tell him when he could pull in again.Oncoming traffic did not seem to deter him and anyone on a bike or a moped had to get off the road or get hit. We arrived in Surabaya at about 6 and decided to go no further as we were both fed up with traveling and to go any further would have meant missing the World Cup semi-final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Wgen we arrived at the bus station, we found an amazingly helpful official who put us on a bemo to the city centre. I took an instant dislike to the city, mainly due to the heavy rush hour traffic we were traveling in. When we were dropped, the city didn't seem to bear any resemblance to our map so again we relied on the help of the locals. All the people we met seemed keener to help us than rip us off - a welcome change after Bali - and we eventually found our way to The Bamboe Denn hostel by about 7. It is the worst place we have stayed so far. We had a sort of double bunk bed in a dormitory which had too many people in it and was too hot. We decided to go straight to the railway station to find out how to get away from Surabaya as quickly as possible. I was keen to get out of Java as quickly as I could. I wasn't enjoying being in a big city again and the thought of going to Jakarta, which we would have to do and could only be worse was not appealing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We couldn't get much information from the station except that there was a possibility of us getting a train tomorrow afternoon. Neither of us were too happy at this stage so we went for a walk round an air-conditioned shopping centre - one of the highlights of Surabaya. We even found a pizza hut which was quite tempting for a while. After eating at one of the local food stalls in the shopping centre, we got a becak back to the hostel and tried to get a couple of hours sleep before the football.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 5th July</span>
                We got up at 1 o'clock to watch England get knocked out of the World Cup by West Germany on penalties. The hostel had a colour tele, it's one good point and we watched the game with one other English bloke. Went to bed at about 3:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We woke at about 6:30 and spent about an hour trying to find a way of getting out of Surabaya. If we were to stick to our schedule, it would meant traveling for six whole days out of the next twelve. All the options seemed to involve long journeys on buses, trains or both. We decided to go to the Pelni shipping offices to see if there is a chance of getting on a boat from Jakarta to just about anywhere in Sumatra.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the office at about 7:45 to find about 100 Indonesians waiting to get in. Someone who had been waiting for a bus with us in Probolinggo turned up and told us there was a ferry leaving Surabaya at midday going to Padang via Jakarta. This was more than we could possibly have hoped for and our only doubt was whether or not we could get tickets. The doors still hadn't opened by 8:30 and the Indonesians, by now 150 of them, were starting to get annoyed and were trying to force the doors open. When the doors did finally open at 8:45 there was a mass stampeded towards the ticket counters. We were trying to decide which counter to go to and everyone kept directing us to an information desk at one end of the booking hall.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked straight to the counter, had our names taken and were issued tickets about five minutes later. We had been incredibly lucky, firstly with the time of the ferry - it only goes once a fortnight - and secondly with our preferential treatment at the ticket office. By the time we left the office it was 9:15. We got a taxi back to the hostel with the Norwegian bloke who told us about the boat, dashed out to a supermarket to buy food and got back into another taxi to take us to the port. We had lost the Norwegian by this time, he was traveling with two girls and gained Rob an Australian who is traveling on the same boat. We arrived at the port at about 10:30, still not really able to believe our luck.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The boat journey was due to take about 51 hours including a four hour stop in Jakarta. We had economy tickets, the class below 4th class.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We boarded the boat just after 11 and left Surabaya on time at midday. The ship probably wouldn't be everyone's ideal way of traveling but compared to going by train or bus, it was sheer luxury. All economy passengers get a space to sleep on a sort of raised platform in an air-conditioned room. We were in a room with about 50 other people. The three of us plus the Norwegians had a set of six beds together which meant we could wander around the boat knowing our luggage would be safe. After the last couple of days it was great to be able to lie down and not have to worry about buses or bemos and to know we would be in Pedang in two days time.

                We were given two meals mainly consisting of boiled rice and a few vegetables. Not overly nice but quite edible. Spent most of the afternoon reading or wandering round the decks
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, Rob reckoned he had managed to secure free beer for us all by talking to a group from the Indonesian Army. We all went to the bar where there was an appalling cabaret act on to find that the beer wasn't free at all. We left after being bought one drink.

                We docked in Jakarta at 9:10 and were allowed off the boat fro about three hours. the book had recommended seeing the old port at Sunda Kelapa so the six of us piled into a chartered bemo after spending about 15 minutes haggling over the price. It took about 20 minutes to get there and wasn't really worth it though we did get to go  onto one of the old schooners. Exciting stuff!

                We walked into Kota and then somehow managed to get into a taxi to take us back to the port. I think three hours was long enough in Jakarta!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we got back onto the boat, there was a load of new people in our room making a fuss about the numbers on their tickets matching up with their sleeping spaces so we moved all our stuff two decks up. Left Jakarta just after 1.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We finally arrived in Pedang at 6pm after a 54 hour journey to find that it was pissing down. The six of us plus two girls piled into an oplet (Sumatran bemo) and got the driver to take us into town to find somewhere to stay. Most places were full due to the fortnightly arrival of the boat and the earlier arrival of a plane. Rags, the Norwegian bloke (a complete dickhead) eventually found a place with two double rooms free but because there wasn't room for all of us told the driver to carry on. We hurriedly stopped the bus and took one of the rooms, the two girls taking the other.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After washing, etc we went to have a look around the town and try some of the famous Padang food. Most of the restaurants were closed so we ended up eating at a street stall that sold meat and chili filled pancakes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At this point we weren't really sure of what to do for the next week. We'd decided to see what was in and around Padang and what sort of flights are available to the Riau Archipelago, where we meet Dave in a weeks time, before making any plans. We have both got fed up of long bus journeys and don't really fancy the long boat journey that we had on our original schedule.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 8th July</span>
                Got up at 1am to watch England v Italy. Felt knackered most of the day. After breakfast and a quick look round for a cheaper losman, we tried to get some information about flights, without much success. We decided to try again tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught an oplet to Bungus, a beach about 22km South of Padang. The beach there was superb, totally undeveloped, very few tourists apart from a few Indonesians and a really nice looking losman about 10m from the waters edge. We had a meal at the losman and decided to bring our rucksacks back here tomorrow and stay for a few days. After a couple of hours on the beach, we got the bus back to Padang, went back to the same place as last night for tea and had an early night. I seem to have caught a cold.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 9th July</span>
                Got up at 1am again to watch The World Cup Final - an appalling game of football.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we got up again at 8:30, we went to the Garuda office, a shining example of inefficiency, not helped by the fact that their computers were down. We walked back across town and managed to get tickets from Padang to Batam for next MOnday for about £25. This means that apart from a two or three day trip to Bukittinggi, which is only about two and a half hours away, we can spend the whole of the next week at Bungus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had breakfast/lunch at a restaurant which placed about ten different dishes in front of us and then worked out the bill by the number we ate. It was a really good meal although we gave the deep fried sparrow a miss. We caught an oplet back to Bungus - this time with all our stuff and checked into the losman at about 1.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had the whole beach to ourselves but it clouded over and started raining at about 3 so we had to spend the afternoon in our room. The rain stopped at about 5 so we went for a long swim, had a wash and then went out for tea. We went to the Carolina beach resort restaurant which was alright but a bit expensive.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 10th July</span>
                We woke up to find that the weather was not too good again. After realising that it was unlikely to clear up, we decided to bring forward our trip to Bukittinggi. We left our rucksacks at the losman as we plan to return in a few days and caught an oplet into Panang. From there we caught a bus to Bukittinggi, a journey that would have been a lot quicker if we hadn't done the first fifteen miles in second gear. We arrived in Bukittinggi at 3 and spent about half an hour looking at hotel rooms before settling on the first one we had seen - our cheapest room yet at Rp4,000.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the hotel we found a notice board which which had details of the ferries between where we are flying to and where we are due to meet Dave. It is more difficult/expensive than we thought so we decided to try and phone Paula to change the meeting place. We asked a traffic cop for directions to the telephone office and he promptly took me down there on the back of his moped. The price of the phone call was ridiculous so we sent a postcard instead, on the off-chance that a) it will get there and b) Dave will go to the post office on Friday!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked around the market which was pretty good, plenty of interesting looking food stalls before returning to the hotel, washing and going out for tea. We went to a branch of the same restaurant chain as the place in Panang belonged to and had a similar sort of meal.

                It was raining again when we woke up so we decided to stay another night in Bukittinggi and go to see the equator during the day. After breakfast at a coffee house, we got on a bus and headed for Bonjol, a small town practically on the equator. The bus journey took a lot longer than expected and we didn't arrive until after midday. We spent about twenty minutes going back and fore over the equator which was marked by a globe and a white line across the road, and having our photos taken before waiting for a bus to take us back to Bukittinggi. When the bus turned up, it was the same one as had got off an hour previously, a fact which was pointed out to everyone by the conductor and seemed to cause a lot of amusement.

                The round trip took about five or six hours. When we got back to Bukittinggi, we walked around the market again buying an assortment of things for lunch and then walked around the Panorama Gardens overlooking the Sianok Canyon. All very nice but nothing spectacular. We spent most of the evening in the hotel room and went out to the Mona Lisa for a meal at about 9. Excellent Chinese food.

                We checked out of the hotel and, after breakfast, headed for Lake Maninjau. Once again, we were on a packed minibus and the journey took about two hours. The lake was very nice but there wasn't a lot to do there so after about an hour we decided to return to Bukittinggi. We waited about an hour for a bus and arrived back at 5. Once more we caused a lot of amusement when we checked back into the same hotel we left this morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to the Mona Lisa for our evening meal and met our Norwegian friends again.

                We left Bukittinggi at 9:30 after our fifth consecutive meal at the Mona Lisa. We had a relatively painless bus journey back to Padang and then an oplet out to Bungus. We were given a pretty grotty room at the losman but were told we could have a proper one tomorrow. Spent the afternoon on the beach.

                Luckily the weather was very good and we spent the day lying on the beach - I've gone beautifully brown unfortunately Dave just went bright red.

                Had breakfast at Carolinas so that Roz could use a Western toilet. We went straight out to the beach again after breakfast to make the most of the good weather. By about 12:30 I was feeling too hot and sun-burnt so I spent the afternoon in the shade either on our veranda or in the room.

                In the evening the losman was only serving nasi goreng again so we decided to try some of the warungs (street stalls) for our meal. This proved to be a good idea as the food we had was excellent and incredibly cheap. We then spent twice as much as both our meals cost on a bottle of beer and returned to the losman.

                We got up at 10 and tried without success to get a meal at the place we ate last night. We caught the bemo into Padang and went for brunch at the place we ate at exactly a week ago. We caught a bus to the airport at 12:30 a half hour journey that cost 3p each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At teh airport, we were quite relieved to find that Sempati Airlines actually existed. Nobody apart from the place where we had bought the tickets had ever heard of them. We checked in and were allowed into the departure lounge just before 2. The plane was due to leave at 2:25 but at 3 we were still in the waiting room, looking at the plane, an F27, parked outside on the tarmac. We were finally allowed onto the plane, were given some sweets and were told to get off again ten minutes later as one of the engines wasn't working.

                We all went back into the waiting room and watched for over an hour as an Indonesian worked frantically on the faulty engine. We re-boarded at 4:30 and took off immediately. I really enjoyed the plane journey as 1) the scenery was excellent and 2) the food was the best I have had on any flight.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Batam, one of the most desolate places I have ever seen, just after 6:00. The airport consisted of a runway, a small building and a taxi rank totally surrounded by forest.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were told that we had missed the last boat to Singapore which means we couldn't meet Dave  and have a 50-50 chance of finding him tomorrow. We were forced to catch an airport taxi into Nygoua, the main town on the island, as the airport is in the middle of nowhere and there were no buses. Due to the taxi driver's monopoly on the public transport, we had to pay Rp10,000 and then found we had to pay the same for a room which wasn't a lot bigger than the double bed in it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a walk around the town which wasn't anything spectacular and then had an early night. We had decided that we should both go to Tanjin Pinang tomorrow to see if Dave is there, if not we will meet him on Wednesday in Singapore.

                We got up at 6:30, checked out of the losman and started walking towards the town again until we stopped a taxi. We had to try three taxis before we found one that would take us to Kabil for a reasonable price Rp4,000. At the port, we waited just ove an hour for a ferry to Tg Uban. The ferry was a small boat only holding about 20 passengers, most of those sitting on deck. Halfway through the journey, we were stopped by the water police who proceeded to search the boat. We couldn't work out what they were looking for but after finding large quantities of 7-Up, they left us to continue our journey. The crossing took about 45 minutes and we were met the other side by a bus that took us straight to Tg Pinang.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at 12 to find that the losman were all full except for dorms so we had to spend Rp13,800 on a room, however, its the best room we've stayed in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for lunch and a look around the town - no sign of Dave! We spent the afternoon lying around in the shade or back in the hotel room. As the room was so good, it seemed a shame not to spend as much time in it as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the room at 6:30 to go and meet Dave at the post office. We had arranged to meet him there at 7pm or 10pm. He was not there by 7:05 so we went off to try and buy boat tickets to Singapore. We had decided to treat ourselves to an air-conditioned ferry all the way instead of having to go via Tg Uban, Kabil, etc, etc. This costs Rp31,000 which appears a lot compared to some of the journeys we had had but it is only about £2.50 more expensive than the slow way.An old bloke at the port took us to a booking office which was closed and managed to get them to open up for us. We tried to get tickets for the direct ferry at 9:30 am which didn't seem to exist so we eventually gave up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to a food market for another excellent and incredibly cheap meal. The food really has been one of the highlights of Indonesia. We went back to the room and played cards until 10 when I went to see if Dave was at the post office. He wasn't so must now be in Singapore. This means that our hour and a half delay on Monday has cost us two days though it has probably put Dave out more than us.
