                We arrived in Auckland at 10:30 and hired a car for the four days we are in New Zealand. We spent the day driving around Auckland with Chris, someone from England who was at the Waikiki Youth Hostel and on our flight.

                It felt good to be driving on the left again and in many respects, the city was very English. We drove up Mt Eden for a view of the town. At 5, we checked into a hostel for $12 each. We cooked sausages for tea and spent the evening drinking beer in the hostels garden.

                We drove down to the town of Tawanga where we spent the day sight-seeing. There wasn't really much to see but what was there was quite good. We toured the Durham Light Kiwi Fruit Winery and after tasting the full range, bought a couple of bottles. We spent about an hour in a hot pool and then walked up Mt Maunganui which gave a great view of the area. We drove from there to Rotorua where we checked into another hostel for the night.

                We spent the day touring the thermal areas around Rotorua. The best place was the first one we visited - Waiotapu Thermal Wonderland. We saw the Lady Knox Geyser and then walked round a load of craters containing boiling springs and sulpher deposits. The while place was like something from a science fiction film and was well worth seeing.

                We also saw boiling mud pools. We went to Hells Gate, another thermal area which was not quite as good as the first and then had a half hour walk around a redwood forest.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we drove down to Lake Taupo and checked into the Rainbow Lodge Hostel which was celebrating its 4th birthday with an all week long series of parties, competitions, etc. We got a few pints in each and drank our kiwi-fruit wine from yesterday. Paul and I won the pool tournament. We also saw Coronation Street on the tele. Generally a good evening.

                We started off by visiting the "Craters of the Moon", another thermal area and then drove down to Tonganro National Park. We went for a two hour walk around Mt Tonganro and saw the Silica Rapids. We also had a good view of Mt Ngauruhoe, an active volcano. We then had a five hour drive to Auckland where the only accomodation we could find was on the floor of the Network Hostel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 9:30, I phoned Karen, a girl who lives in Auckland who I met in Athens three years ago. I was invited to her house where I met her family and had sandwiches and tea for about two hours.

                We arrived at the airport at 9 to discover that our flight had been canceled due to mechanical problems with our plane at Honolulu. We were transferred to a Quantas flight at 4:30 and sent out to the THC Hotel near the airport. We spent about four hours at the hotel. We had a room with a tele, use of the gym and a free meal so overall, we quite enjoyed the delay. We returned to the airport by 2:30 to find the flight was further delayed until 5:10. We finally left Auckland at 5:30.
