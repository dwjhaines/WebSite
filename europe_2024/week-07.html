          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 10th July - Netherlands v England</span>
          I was up by 9ish and went for a walk to the other side of the old town to buy breakfast. We had decided to get the 12:52 train into Dortmund. Steve and Sheila were ready to go before us so they went in on an earlier train. We left the hotel at about 12:15. After buying food at the station, we realised that an earlier train to Dortmund was running late and we were able to get on that. This train got later during the half hour journey but we arrived in Dortmund at round about the time we had expected to if we had got the planned train.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the station and started walking towards the main square in the centre. The whole of the town centre was pretty horrendous with far too many people about. The Netherlands had bought an estimated 80,000 fans over for this game and the town was full of them. We had no desire to stay in the centre. It was not the fact that the majority of fans around were Dutch, it was just the sheer number of them that meant everywhere was packed. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We decided to leave the centre straight away instead of trying to find Steve and headed out to the Hövels Hausbrauerei where we had been drinking the last time England played in Dortmund. There were quite a few fans here from both countries. It was relatively quiet compared to the town centre but there were enough people there to make the atmosphere good. We stayed for about three hours and had food before we left.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We started to walk towards the ground at 5ish. The ground is only about 2.5km from the brewery with plenty of places to drink along the way. Again, most places were totally packed so we decided to head slightly off the main road and immediately found the Borrusia Dortmund "Fan-Projekt" bar. This was an excellent place with the cheapest beer we have had since getting to Germany (0.3l for €1.50). We think it is run by fans of the club and consisted of a single bar with one beer tap and a barman who was just constantly pouring one beer after another. It was mainly full of England fans but the service was excellent and we had the added bonus of Three Lions, Sweet Caroline, etc being played all the time we were there.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We stayed in here longer than we intended to due to a combination of the cheap beer and a thunder storm outside, but at about 6:15 we left and went to join Steve at a bar just off the main road, a bit closer to the ground. The rest of his lot had been at the ground for most of the day for some reason so he was there with Birgit, a Dortmund fan who he had met here in 2017. The bar was a small craft beer type place and we had a few more drinks before heading to the ground which by this point was only about 15 minutes walk away.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got to the ground about 20 minutes before kick-off and took our seats in the corner. Not the best seats we have had in the tournament but there was no-one tall in front of us so we still had a very good view of the game. The game was by far the best we have seen so far out here with an unbelievable ending and for the second time running, we have made to the final of the Euros. We stayed in the ground for a while afterwards to join in the celebrations and left when the players had gone off.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Roz and I left on our own and walked back towards the station. We found a bar where we were able to stop for a beer on the way and then bought another to have on the train. The station was pretty busy as usual but we forced our way onto a train that was full and left Dortmund quite quickly at about 12:30. We were back in Essen about 30 minutes later and had one more beer in the hotel bar before bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 11th July</span>
          I was up first again and walked to the station to buy breakfast. Before last night, we did not have any firm plans for what we would do if England made the final apart from a vague plan of starting to drive towards Berlin today and seeing how far we got. However, after a few drinks last night we had found a nice looking apartment in the village of Colditz and had made a reservation for tonight and tomorrow. We had been thinking of going there anyway to visit the castle so it did make sense to stay there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both still happy with this plan when we woke up so we left the hotel by 10:00 and started driving East. The journey should have taken about five hours but with three stops and having to drive slowly due to heavy rain in the middle of the journey we did not arrive in Colditz until about 4:15. We found the apartment which is just about in the walls of the castle. There was a bit of confusion over where to park but eventually one of the neighbours told us we could park in their space over the road which was ideal. We unloaded the car and then went out to buy food from Lidl.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We did not do a lot else for the rest of the day. We did go for a walk around the village in the evening, mainly to get different views of the castle. We ate in the apartment and had a quiet early night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 12th July</span>
          We were up by 8:30 and had breakfast in the apartment. We had planned to visit Colditz Castle this morning and go out on our bikes this afternoon, but we had a message from Steve saying that him and Sheila would not be getting here until midday, so we decided to go out on our bikes straight away.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We did not have much time for too long a ride but we were able to cycle 10 miles along the Mulde as far as Grimma before turning round. All quite nice without being too spectacular. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The others had got to the castle by the time we got back. We dropped off our bikes at the apartment, had quick showers and went up the hill to join them. The tour of the castle was excellent. We paid €10 each and were each given a "HistoPad", an interactive tablet with maps, pictures and "immersive experiences". We walked round on our own stopping in all the rooms and getting information from the HistoPad while collecting virtual escape equipment. We are not normally that interested in such things but this was really well done and kept us entertained for a couple of hours.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the castle just after 3. Steve and Sheila were getting a bus and then train back to Leipzig before going on to Berlin. We should see them again tomorrow in Potsdam. We walked back to the apartment for lunch. Again, we did not do much for what was left of the afternoon. Roz watched tennis on her iPad. I went out for another walk at 6ish to complete my steps for the day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There are not too many places to eat and drink in Colditz and a lot of the places that are here are closed more than they are open. We did spot a place up near the castle that was open (until 9pm) so we went up there for a couple of drinks. It had stopped raining so we were able to sit outside with views of the castle which was all quite pleasant.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After a couple in there, we returned to the apartment to eat and had a couple more drinks before going to bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 13th July</span>
          We were up before 9, had breakfast and packed up the car. We left the apartment at 10ish and had a stop for wine at Lidl before continuing on the last leg of our drive towards Berlin. We had looked at quite a few options of where to stay for the game tomorrow but eventually decided on spending three nights at the B&B in Potsdam. It is close to Potsdam Hbf which is on the Berlin S-Bahn and there are trains back from Berlin all night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It was another easy drive of just over two hours. We found the hotel easily and were able to check into the room straight away. We had lunch in the room before heading out on our bikes. We did not go that far but spent an hour or so cycling round Schlosspark Sanssouci. This was an incredible place. It is a large park filled with spectacular buildings. We did not go in any of them but it was very enjoyable just cycling round looking at them all. The Neuen Palais was particularly impressive.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We met up with Steve and Sheila who are staying in Berlin but had come out to visit Potsdam. We then did a few more miles on the bikes before returning to the hotel for showers.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showering, we went straight back out and met Steve and Sheila again at Augustiner Potsdam. They left to return to Berlin after a couple of hours. We stayed there a bit longer and joined a few people who we had met in Georgia last year. Leaving there is a bit of a vague memory but we stopped for a pizza on the way back to the hotel and then had a few more drinks while joining the J-Team video call.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 14th July - Spain v England</span>
          We left the hotel at midday and walked to the station. There were not too many food options at the station so be had a McDonalds before getting the train into Berlin. We caught the 12:31 train which was on time and got us into Berlin Hbf by 1pm.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had thought about spending an hour or so looking at the sights before meeting up with the others. However, the area around the Brandenburg Gate was taken over by fan-zones and as we started walking down Unter den Linden, it started raining quite heavily. We sheltered for ten minutes or so and then ran to a U-Bahn station, got the train a couple of stops to Rotes Rathaus and then went to Zum Nußbaum for our first beer of the day.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Steve was meeting everyone else in Prater Biergarten, just North of the centre. The rain had stopped by the time we had finished our drinks so we got on a tram and went and joined them. That group do not normally choose great places to drink but this was a nice enough spot and not too crowded. Bob, Gavin and Gary were all there as well as Jer and Imogen and a few others we had not met before. We stayed there for about three hours and had a very enjoyable afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the beer garden just after 6 and got a U-Bahn to the Olympic Stadium. This was not the quickest way of getting to the ground, particularly as it took us to the wrong end but it was a single train all the way and meant that we did not have to change in the centre of Berlin where all the trains would be packed. We were at the ground by 7 and then spent the best part of an hour walking round and getting in. Everything was a lot busier than it had been for previous games but we had plenty of time so not a big problem. We got a hot-dog and a beer and went and joined the others in our seats.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Not much to say about the game other than it was another very frustrating and disappointing experience. Getting to the final was a big achievement but as with three years ago, we just came away with the feeling that they could have done better. It really was a missed opportunity and I don't know when we will get such a good chance of winning a tournament again. This has not been a great tournament for England but we have been to a second final and there have been some very memorable moments so it is certainly not the worst we have been to!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          As soon as the final whistle went, Roz and I were keen to get away. Neither of us were keen on waiting around to see the trophy being presented to Spain. We said our goodbyes to everyone and headed straight to the S-Bahn. Compared to the earlier games this all went reasonably smoothly. We were lucky to get on one of the first trains to leave the station after we got there and when we did have to change, had a wait of about a minute for the train back to Potsdam. There was nothing much open when we got back and neither of us were really interested in doing anything anyway. We were back in the hotel before midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 15th July</span>
          Woke up with the usual miserable feeling that always comes with getting knocked out or losing in a tournament. I went to the supermarket by the station to buy breakfast, an experience that did nothing to improve my mood.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After eating we went out on our bikes again. We returned to Schlosspark Sanssouci and went round some of the buildings that we had not seen on Saturday. All quite nice but nothing anywhere near as spectacular as the Neuen Palais. After we returned to the hotel, Roz went to sit in the sun in a park and I went out and did another 10 miles on my bike. I then had lunch and went to sleep for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We returned to the Augustiner place in the evening. We ate there this time so were not quite as drunk when we left as we were two nights ago. We stopped for one more on the way back to the hotel and were home just after 11.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 16th July</span>
          Roz went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the room. We were in no hurry to leave this morning as we were only going to Magdeburg about 80 miles away. We left at midday, stopped for petrol and were in Magdeberg just before 2. We had a few issues finding the entrance to the apartment and then working out where the car park was but by about 2:30 we had parked and got our stuff inside.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had booked the apartment for three days. Once again, there is not a huge amount of things to do here but it is somewhere we have not been to before and we are in need of a few quiet days before the drive back across to Aachen. We went out and bought food from the supermarket and ate lunch in the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Neither of us could be bothered to go out on our bikes so we spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around in the apartment. We did go out for a walk in the evening and did manage to see the main sights of Magdeberg. This consisted mainly of the cathedral and the "Green Citadel", a slightly bizarre collection of buildings in the centre of town. We also found a few places that looked good for drinking but were having a night off so will save those for tomorrow.
