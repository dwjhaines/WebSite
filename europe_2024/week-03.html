          We were up by 8ish and walked into Ulm for breakfast. We bought food from a and ate it sat looking at the minster. It was sunny today so we walked round taking a few more pictures before returning to Neu-Ulm. I bought the car into the hotel car park, loaded up all our luggage, collected the bikes and we were on our way out of Neu-Ulm by about 10:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a stop for petrol and then started heading to Miltenberg. We had one stop for a break half way through the journey and got to the apartment at 2pm. We had decided that after all the travelling of the last two weeks, we needed somewhere to stay for a few days so had booked to stay at Apartment "Burgblick" for three nights. The apartment is very nice with good views looking at the castle on the other side of the river.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After we had unloaded the car, we cycled to the supermarket to buy lunch which we ate on our terrace. We went straight out again after eating. First we had a look round the old town which is an excellent place and then went down the Mainradreg for about 6 or 7 miles before returning to the apartment. We then drove back to the supermarket to stock up on food and drink for the next three days.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers, we had a drink in the apartment and then walked into the old town, about half a mile away on the other side of the river. Earlier there had been loads of places that looked good for eating and drinking but most of them were closed by the time we got there and the ones that were open either closed or stopped serving food at 9pm. Miltenberg does not appear to be a late night place.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked through the old town to the Faust Braustuben where they were still serving food. We had good meals with a couple of beers. This place was also advertising that they will be showing all of Germany's games in the Euros so we booked a table for Friday evening for the Germany v Scotland game. We walked back to the apartment and had one more drink before going to bed.

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 13th June</span>
          We had bought food for breakfast which we ate on our terrace. The weather was not too bad today. I went for a walk around the old town and up to the castle while Roz spent an hour or so sitting in the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went out on our bikes at 10:30. We had seen a sign to Wirtheim, 33km away along the Main and decided to head there. IT was a nice enough fairly easy ride with no nasty hills or surprises. We had chosen the town as it was the right distance away but it was actually another very nice place to visit with plenty more half-timbered houses and a nice square for an ice-cream stop. In total the round trip was 45 miles and we were back in Miltenberg by about 3:30. We stopped to buy rolls at the supermarket and had a late lunch on the terrace.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers, we walked back to the supermarket to buy a few more things for this evening. We then walked back into the old town and had a couple of drinks at Kalt-Loch Bräustüble which was a very nice place to sit. We walked back to the apartment and ate sat on the terrace with a few more drinks.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 14th June</span>
          Another day where the weather was not so great. I was awake before Roz so got up and had breakfast on my own. We had already decided to go on separate bike rides today as I was keen on going for another long ride and Roz planned to do a shorter one with more stops!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I went off just before 9 and did a similar ride to yesterday. I made it as far up the river as Wirtheim but this time did not cross the bridge and go into the town. A round trip this time of 43 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both back in the apartment by 12:30. after showers and something to eat, we headed back into the old town. We had booked a brewery tour for 2pm at the Faust brewery. This had looked good when I was looking for places to drink a few months ago and it was a very good tour. We entered a small beer hall type place and were immediately given a bottle of sommerfestbier each. I had not been that impressed with the Faust Helles but this was an excellent beer. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After an introduction we were shown a film about the brewery while we drank our beers. The film was all in German but we got the general idea of what was going on. We then had the tour (also in German) which was pretty good despite not being able to understand it. The tour was about 40 minutes and included going out onto the roof giving us views of the old town as well as our car and apartment. At the end, we were given another beer each in another room and also shown the old cellars under the castle.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The whole tour was excellent and not bad value considering it cost €12 each and included two beers. We stopped on the way out to buy our souvenirs and were back outside by about 3:45. It would have been very easy at this point to have carried on drinking. However, the Germany v Scotland game was not until 9pm and we did not really want to get too pissed tonight anyway. We walked back to the apartment then went to the supermarket to get a few things to eat and drink, then had a bit of a pause before starting again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a drink in the apartment with a few nibbles then went out again just after 6. We stopped for one drink at the sports ground near where we are staying mainly because their terrace has very good views of the old town on the other side of the river. We walked from there back to Kalt-Loch Bräustüble for one and then went to the Faust Braustuben to take our seats for the football. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The big screen had been set up in the garden. We were there by 8 so had an hour to eat before the football started. We were at the far end of the garden from the tele but we had a good enough view to be able to see what was going on. Not everyone was bothered about the game but enough people were watching it to create a reasonable atmosphere. An enjoyable game and an entertaining result (Germany 5, Scotland 1).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We paid and left as soon as the football finished, had a couple of glasses of wine back in the apartment and got to bed around midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 15th June</span>
          We had to check out by 10:00. We were up by about 8:30, had breakfast before packing up the car, paying for the apartment and leaving. We had a stop at Rewe to get rid of empty bottles and buy a case of the Faust Sommerfestbier. We left MIltenberg at almost exactly 10:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a 320km drive to Krefeld where we are staying for the next two nights. The journey was fairly straightforward. We had one stop for lunch and arrived at the B&B at 14:00.
