          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 12th June</span>
          We were up by 8ish and walked into Ulm for breakfast. We bought food from a bakery and ate it sat looking at the minster. It was sunny today so we walked round taking a few more pictures before returning to Neu-Ulm. I bought the car into the hotel car park, loaded up all our luggage, collected the bikes and we were on our way out of Neu-Ulm by about 10:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a stop for petrol and then started heading to Miltenberg. We had one stop for a break half way through the journey and got to the apartment at 2pm. We had decided that after all the travelling of the last two weeks, we needed somewhere to stay for a few days so had booked to stay at Apartment "Burgblick" for three nights. The apartment is very nice with good views looking at the castle on the other side of the river.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After we had unloaded the car, we cycled to the supermarket to buy lunch which we ate on our terrace. We went straight out again after eating. First we had a look round the old town which is an excellent place and then went down the Mainradreg for about 6 or 7 miles before returning to the apartment. We then drove back to the supermarket to stock up on food and drink for the next three days.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers, we had a drink in the apartment and then walked into the old town, about half a mile away on the other side of the river. Earlier there had been loads of places that looked good for eating and drinking but most of them were closed by the time we got there and the ones that were open either closed or stopped serving food at 9pm. Miltenberg does not appear to be a late night place.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked through the old town to the Faust Braustuben where they were still serving food. We had good meals with a couple of beers. This place was also advertising that they will be showing all of Germany's games in the Euros so we booked a table for Friday evening for the Germany v Scotland game. We walked back to the apartment and had one more drink before going to bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 13th June</span>
          We had bought food for breakfast which we ate on our terrace. The weather was not too bad today. I went for a walk around the old town and up to the castle while Roz spent an hour or so sitting in the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went out on our bikes at 10:30. We had seen a sign to Wirtheim, 33km away along the Main and decided to head there. IT was a nice enough fairly easy ride with no nasty hills or surprises. We had chosen the town as it was the right distance away but it was actually another very nice place to visit with plenty more half-timbered houses and a nice square for an ice-cream stop. In total the round trip was 45 miles and we were back in Miltenberg by about 3:30. We stopped to buy rolls at the supermarket and had a late lunch on the terrace.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers, we walked back to the supermarket to buy a few more things for this evening. We then walked back into the old town and had a couple of drinks at Kalt-Loch Bräustüble which was a very nice place to sit. We walked back to the apartment and ate sat on the terrace with a few more drinks.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 14th June</span>
          Another day where the weather was not so great. I was awake before Roz so got up and had breakfast on my own. We had already decided to go on separate bike rides today as I was keen on going for another long ride and Roz planned to do a shorter one with more stops!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I went off just before 9 and did a similar ride to yesterday. I made it as far up the river as Wirtheim but this time did not cross the bridge and go into the town. A round trip this time of 43 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both back in the apartment by 12:30. After showers and something to eat, we headed back into the old town. We had booked a brewery tour for 2pm at the Faust brewery. This had looked good when I was looking for places to drink a few months ago and it was a very good tour. We entered a small beer hall type place and were immediately given a bottle of sommerfestbier each. I had not been that impressed with the Faust Helles but this was an excellent beer. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After an introduction we were shown a film about the brewery while we drank our beers. The film was all in German but we got the general idea of what was going on. We then had the tour (also in German) which was pretty good despite not being able to understand it. The tour was about 40 minutes and included going out onto the roof giving us views of the old town as well as our car and apartment. At the end, we were given another beer each in another room and also shown the old cellars under the castle.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The whole tour was excellent and not bad value considering it cost €12 each and included two beers. We stopped on the way out to buy our souvenirs and were back outside by about 3:45. It would have been very easy at this point to have carried on drinking. However, the Germany v Scotland game was not until 9pm and we did not really want to get too pissed tonight anyway. We walked back to the apartment then went to the supermarket to get a few things to eat and drink, then had a bit of a pause before starting again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a drink in the apartment with a few nibbles then went out again just after 6. We stopped for one drink at the sports ground near where we are staying mainly because their terrace has very good views of the old town on the other side of the river. We walked from there back to Kalt-Loch Bräustüble for one and then went to the Faust Braustuben to take our seats for the football. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The big screen had been set up in the garden. We were there by 8 so had an hour to eat before the football started. We were at the far end of the garden from the tele but we had a good enough view to be able to see what was going on. Not everyone was bothered about the game but enough people were watching it to create a reasonable atmosphere. An enjoyable game and an entertaining result (Germany 5, Scotland 1).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We paid and left as soon as the football finished, had a couple of glasses of wine back in the apartment and got to bed around midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 15th June</span>
          We had to check out by 10:00. We were up by about 8:30, had breakfast before packing up the car, paying for the apartment and leaving. We had a stop at Rewe to get rid of empty bottles and buy a case of the Faust Sommerfestbier. We left MIltenberg at almost exactly 10:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a 320km drive to Krefeld where we are staying for the next two nights. The journey was fairly straightforward. We had one stop for lunch and arrived at the B&B at 14:00. We were both worn out by the time we arrived so decided against any form of exercise and stayed in the room to watch the Switzerland v Hungary game instead. I went out for a walk when that game finished and we both went out to watch the Spain v Croatia game at 6.
        </p>
         <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Mark was due to arrive in Krefeld at 6 but had had a few delays and had a new ETA of 6:40. We found a small bar near the station (about five minutes walk from the hotel) and went in there to watch the first half while waiting for him. When he arrived, he went to check in then joined us for the second half.
        </p>
         <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There were not too many good drinking options in Krefeld particularly if we want to watch the football. We stopped for a couple of drinks in Brauereiausschank Wienges. This had looked about the best place for drinking when I went for my walk but did not have a T.V. After a couple in there, we walked down to Cafe Extrablatt. This was a chain restaurant that had a good food menu and a big screen showing the Italy v Albania game. Probably not the sort of place we would usually go into but the food was good, beer was fine and it was a good place to watch the game.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had one more drink in there after the football finished and then walked back to the bar by the station. There were quite a few English and Scottish fans in there by now and it was a good way to end the evening. Got back to the hotel at 1:45.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 16th June - Serbia v England</span>
          We met Mark in reception and walked back to Cafe Extrablatt for breakfast. We had chosen to stay in Krefeld because it is not far from Gelsenkirchen (where todays game was being played) and there were trains that meant we could get back relatively easily. The first problem with this plan was that there are no trains running on the lines to Krefeld at the moment so we started our journey on a replacement bus service. This was slow but got us to Rhinehausen where we got on a train to Essen.
        </p> 
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had agreed to go to Essen for our pre-match beers and the three of us arrived there by 12:45. Mark then got another train to Dortund where he is staying tonight. We went and walked round the town centre for about an hour before getting a tram out to the pub where we were meeting everyone. Mick had been recommended a brewery that was about 10 minutes away from the centre by S-Bahn although we ended up on tram which took about 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Roz and I were the first to arrive at the brewery and it was a superb place. It was a big place, all very traditionally German with lots of different rooms. It was quite full when we arrived but we got a table and had a couple of drinks while waiting for the others. We were joined by Steve, Mick, Mark and Lisa after an hour or so and not long after they arrived, Mark and Sheila appeared. We were given a bigger table that we could all sit round and had a very good afternoon in there.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/europe24_024.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Mark, Lisa and Mick headed off towards the ground at 6 in a taxi. In retrospect, this was a very good move. The rest of us got the 18:23 train from outside the brewery back to Essen. We should have then got the 18:41 train to Gelsenkirchen. This train was late getting in to the station but only by 10 minutes or so. However, once we were on it, it did not move. Apparently the driver thought the train was too full and was refusing to move. The police did not think it was too full and were telling him to go but nothing was happening. Eventually we all had to get off and look for another train.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There was then 30 minutes or so of complete confusion with more cancellations and platform changes and people running round the station trying to find trains. We were all waiting for one train when Mark found out about one from a different platform. Roz and I went with him and the three of us ran across to get on what we think was the original 18:41. The train moved out about an hour later than it should have done. At Gelsenkirchen we got onto a tram relatively quickly, mainly due to the fact that not many fans had been able to get that far. The tram was painfully slow and was stuck near the station at the ground for ages before someone pulled the emergency door handles and we all piled off onto the road.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There were no queues to get in and we got to our seats about 10 - 15 minutes before the 9pm kick-off. We were eventually joined by Steve and Sheila who had come on a train a couple of minutes after ours.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/europe24_025.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The game itself was OK without being great. We got the three points which was the most important thing but it was not the most thrilling of performances. Towards the end of the game we made our way towards the exit so we could dash to the tram stop as soon as the game finished. We left as soon as the final whistle was blown and were at the tram stop fairly quickly. It was all a bit manic again as the tram system simply can not cope with the amount of people trying to use it. However, leaving the ground when we did meant that we were on a tram relatively quickly and we were back in Gelsenkirchen by 11:41.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Gelsenkirchen station was every bit as disorganised as Essen had been earlier. There were simply too many people for the number of trains. We failed to get on the first train as it was too full but did get on the 00:01 to Duisburg. This train was 13 minutes late meaning we had a 50 minute wait until 01:35 for a train back to Rhinehausen. We had another wait for a replacement bus and eventually got back into Krefeld at about 02:50.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Overall, it had been a good day and a very good result but it will probably remembered more for the chaos on the public transport system than for the quality of the football.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 17th June</span>
          Despite the late night yesterday, we were both up by 9ish. I walked to the Rewe to buy breakfast which we ate in the room. After eating, Roz went out to buy a coffee and bumped into Bob and Gavin in reception. We had no idea that they were staying here! They had not got back to the hotel until 5am this morning.
        </p> 
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We checked out and left just after 11. We stopped for petrol and then had a fairly straight-forward drive down to Bacharach where we will be staying for the next two nights. We stopped at a supermarket in Oberwesal to buy food for the next couple of days and arrived at the apartment we had booked at 2:20. The place we have stayed a couple of times before in Bacharach was not available so we had booked another place just past the railway station. This was another very nice apartment with loads of space. Not quite as nice views from the terrace but ideal for a couple of days anyway. We will also be able to leave the car here when we go to Mainz in two days time.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had lunch and watched some of the Ukraine v Romania match before going out on our bikes. We were not bothered about doing a long ride but cycled back to Oberwesal. We have gone past Oberwesal several times but cycled through the town centre this time and it was another nice place. We stopped at Rewe again to buy pizzas for tonight and then returned to Bacharach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We watched bits of the Slovakia v Belgium game. There are a few issues with the T.V. here meaning we are watching games on Roz's iPad which is not ideal. I went for a walk after the game to complete my steps for the day. We are both in need of a couple of days off alcohol again so we ate the pizzas on our terrace before watching the France v Austria game and having a relatively early night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 18th June</span>
          I was awake early so went for a walk before breakfast. I went up to the castle and out to the far end of Bacharach. We had breakfast on the terrace when I got back.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had decided to go out on separate bike rides again today as I was keen on doing a longer ride. I went off at 9 and had a very enjoyable ride down to Koblenz. I had thought about going 25 miles before turning round but the weather was lovely for cycling and I decided to to the extra 6 or 7 miles and got as far as the Deutches Eck. Roz in the mean time had started cycling to Boppard.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          As soon as I turned round, the sky had turned an ominous dark grey colour. I had got about eight miles into the return journey when the rain started. I found somewhere to shelter and spent about 30 minutes watching another thunder storm with torrential rain. Roz meanwhile was watching the same storm from under cover in Boppard. Once the storm had passed, the rain did ease and it was not too bad a journey back. I passed Roz in Sankt Goar and kept going, getting back to the apartment by about 2:40 after a ride of just over 64 miles. Roz came back via the supermarket having done almost 37 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both worn out by the end of our rides and did not do a lot else after lunch on the terrace. I did walk to the post office to post our claim for compensation for the Milan - Munich train delay but spent the rest of the afternoon on the settee.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There were only two games today. We watched bits of Turkey v Georgia before eating on the terrace and then Portugal v Czech Rebublic. The first game was quite entertaining but we were bored with the first half of the Portugal game so went to bed at half-time.
