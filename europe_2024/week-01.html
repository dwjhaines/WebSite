          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 29th May</span>
          We left Kingsclere at 2pm. We had a stop for petrol and lunch in Basingstoke and then an uneventful, if a bit slow, journey down to Dover. We arrived at the Travelodge just before 6. After checking in and dropping our bags, we went straight out for the evening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked to The Staggered Inn, a micropub that had opened since the last time we stayed in Dover. The pub was nothing special but the beer was good and we stayed in there until it was about to close at 8. We walked back into the centre for food and a few more beers at the Wetherspoons and were back in the hotel  just after 10.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 30th May</span>
          We were awake before the alarm and, after showers, checked out of the hotel by about 5:45. There were no queues to get into the port and by 6, we were checked in and waiting to board the 6:55 P&O ferry to Calais. We boarded by 6:30 and left Dover a few minutes late just after 7.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got to Dover just about on time and although we were just about the last vehicle off the ferry, we were on the motorway heading towards Belgium by about 10:00. We had our usual stop in Adinkerke to drop off our empty bottles before driving across Belgium to Aachen. We stopped for lunch just after Brussels and were in Aachen by about 2.30. We found the hotel car park easily enough and checked into the Mercure Aachen am Dom where we had booked a room for the night. As usual with Mercures, we were given an upgrade so had a good room with a balcony and a view of the top of the cathedral.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The hotel did not have a bar so we had our complimentary drink sat on our balcony before going out for the evening. We walked to Poststübchen which was closed due to today being a public holiday in Germany - something that we had failed to notice again. By now it had started raining so we went round the corner for one in Hopfen+Malz. We went from there to the Aachener Brauhaus where we had a couple more beers and something to eat. After eating, we walked to the Ratskeller which now appears to be called Postwagon Aachen. We are not sure if we were using the wrong name before or if it has changed in the last year but it was very good in there again and we got through three rounds while sat at the bar.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Things get a bit vague from here but we walked down to the Domkeller where we had a couple more before walking back to the hotel. We were asleep before 10.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 31st May</span>
          Our usual breakfast place in Aachen had become a chocolate shop since we were here last so we went out for breakfast at Backwerk opposite the hotel. We checked out of the hotel, stopped to fill up with petrol and were on our way out of Aachen by 10:30. The 500km journey to Neu Ulm was not too bad apart from the last hour or so when the weather was atrocious. Heavy rain made the driving quite slow but getting through Ulm was easy and we still made it to the B&B in Neu-Ulm before 5. 
        </p>       
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went out for the evening at 6 after putting our bikes in the B&B bike room (where they will stay until we come back here next week). It was still raining when we went out so we stopped in Posthorn for a few drinks before crossing the Danube into Ulm. As we crossed the river we noticed that the cycle path is currently under water which is slightly concerning as we plan to start cycling along it in less than a weeks time!
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had booked a table at Barfüßer Hausbrauerei for 8pm and spent an enjoyable few hours in there. The rain meant that wandering round the town was not that appealing. We left there just after 11 and called in at a couple more bars on the way back. Ronnie Biggs was a strange bar that we would probably not go back to again. Bingo, a kleine kneipe was a much nicer pub type place. Got back to the hotel at about 12:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 1st June</span>
          It was still raining heavily when we woke up. We did not fancy doing anything that involved going outside so we stayed in the room until we checked out just before midday. We moved the car from the hotel car park and parked it on the road opposite. Previously when we have left the car in Ulm, we have left it at the hotel but they have started charging €8 a day whereas the street parking is free. Today was the first day of our Deutschland ticket. With the exception of the fast inter-city trains, this gives us unlimited travel on Germany's trains for a month for €49. 
        </p>       
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked to the shopping centre by Neu-Ulm train station for breakfast and then walked to the station. The rail network seemed to be having a lot of problems again, this time caused by flooding. We eventually got the 12:54 for a five minute journey to a very chaotic Ulm station. There were further delays here but we got on the 13:29 train to Wendlingen. We got to Wendlingen on time at 13:59 and had a dash across the station to get on an S-Bahn train that was leaving about a minute later.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The S-Bahn should have taken us through Stuttgart to Böblingen, a journey of about an hour. However, when we got to Vaihingen, we were all told to get off the train. Apparently a tree had fallen onto the track and the S-Bahn trains could not get through. The next hour was all a bit of a mess. We were only five miles from Böblingen but no-one had a clue how we should get there. The station staff did not know what was going on, there were plenty of announcements and platform changes but each time we thought we were getting on a train, it would get cancelled at the last minute. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 15:55, we had had enough of Vaihingen and got an S-Bahn back to Stuttgart. We thought there would be RE trains going from here to Böblingen and managed to just get on the 16:24. Twenty minutes later, we finally arrived in Böblingen. We walked to the B&B which is about a minutes walk from the station and checked in for the night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          By this time, it had finally stopped raining so we went straight out for a walk. There is nothing too much to see and do here - we are staying here because there is a cheap bus to Milan from here tomorrow morning. (We had decided that despite the Springsteen concert being postponed, we may as well still go to Italy for a couple of days particularly as the weather in this area is so poor at the moment.) First of all, we established where our bus leaves from tomorrow - just the other side of the station. The old town was nice enough without being too spectacular. Most of the bars/restaurants seemed to be closed but there are enough options here for one night. We bought a few things for tomorrows journey and returned to the hotel.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Back in the room, I found that there was a brewery - Wichtel Hausbrauerei - about a three minute walk away from the hotel. This seemed a better option than some of the places we had seen earlier so we went and ate there. We needed a less alcoholic evening than the last couple of nights but still had a few drinks with very good "gnome cakes" (pizzas). We were back in the room just after 9:00 to watch most of the Champions League final.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 2nd June</span>
          We were up by 6:30 and made the short walk to the bus stop. Our bus had travelled overnight from Hamburg and was already there when we arrived. We appeared to be the only passengers getting on at Böblingen so the bus departed as soon as we boarded just before 7 despite it not being due to leave until 7:15.
        </p>       
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The journey was due to be eight and a quarter hours. The bus was very cheap (about €16 each) and we had paid €4 each extra to get the seats right at the front on the upper deck. It was a comfortable journey and we had excellent views as we drove through The Alps. The weather was still pretty poor for a lot of the day but improved dramatically as we came out the other side of Alps and we were finally able to see the sun and some blue sky for the first time on this trip.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We eventually got into Milan Lampugnano bus station at about 4:45, nearly nine hours after we had got on. It had been an enjoyable journey and it did not feel as if we had been on the bus for that long. The bus station was attached to a metro station so we got straight on a metro to Lima, a half mile walk from our next B&B. We checked in for two nights. The hotel was not quite as modern as German B&Bs but is fine and in a good location.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers we went out for the evening. There was what looked a very good pizza restaurant about a 10 minute walk away with a craft beer bar on the way. We walked to have a look at the restaurant (Nàpiz' Milano) first and checked that it was open. We then went back to Birra di Quartiere an excellent bar. They had a good range of IPA's with the 8% one being particularly good value. We stayed in there for a few while a huge thunder storm passed and walked back to the restaurant when the rain had eased a bit.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The restaurant was also very good. We had pizzas and a couple of bottles of wine before walking home via Birra di Quartiere again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 3rd June</span>
          We left the hotel at 11:15 for a few hours of sight-seeing. We were in Milan last year but we were staying near the San Siro and on the day we did have to see the sights, it was raining heavily. Although it was a bit drizzley first thing, by 11 the rain had stopped and the sun was starting to come out. 
        </p>       
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked towards the centre and stopped at a cafe for sandwiches for brunch. We walked through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping centre and out into the square by the cathedral. The cathedral is very impressive and did look a lot better than it did in the rain last year. From there we went to the Santuario di San Bernardino alle Ossa round the corner. This is a not very remarkable church but it does have a spectacular ossuary, a small chappel with the walls lined with bones.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked back past the cathedral and then out to Castello Sforzesco. Neither of  us could remember visiting this place on previous visits but it was quite a spectacular castle. We wandered round the buildings and then spent some time wandering through the gardens. These were all quite pleasant with the added bonus of a pond filled with terrapins.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We returned to the cathedral again for more photos and then walked back to the hotel. We went out for the evening at 5:30. We walked back to Lima station where there was another craft beer bar - Bierfabrik. After a couple here, we walked back to Birra di Quartiere for a couple more. Nàpiz' Milano was closed on a Monday so we ate instead at Berberè Pizzeria. We had excellent pizzas again with a few carafes of wine and then returned to Birra di Quartiere where we were able to watch the second half of England v Bosnia.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 4th June</span>
          We checked out of the hotel and walked to the station in time for the 9:58 train to Bologna. The journey to Bologna should have taken just over an hour which would have given us plenty of time to catch our train to Munich at 11:52.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/europe24_008.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          During the journey, we were told that the train was delayed and it soon became apparent that we were going to miss our connection. While we were starting to realise this, Roz got the news that following her breast scan, she had a hospital appointment on Thursday, i.e. in two days time, for further tests. There is no way that she could miss this so we now need to find a way of getting back home tomorrow. 
        </p>       
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We eventually got into Bologna just over an hour late at 12:10 having missed our train to Munich. We found somewhere to sit and I went to try and find out what our options were. After a bit of a wait at the ticket office I was told that we could not just get on any train but our ticket would be valid for the 15:50 train direct to Munich. Once this was sorted out, we looked into options for getting home and Roz booked us both onto flights back to Heathrow for tomorrow lunchtime. We will leave the car in Ulm and hopefully return to Germany in a few days time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After doing this, we still had more than two hours to kill so had time to walk into the centre of town for a look around the main square and the two towers. We stopped for an ice-cream on the way back and were back in the station by 3. This train left on time and we were relieved to be able to get seats despite not having reservations and also that our tickets were accepted by the guard.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          This train was 19 minutes late at one point but caught up some of the time and was only 10 minutes late when we arrived in Innsbruck. However, it then developed a fault and we were stuck there for about an hour. We had been due to get into Munich at 18:28. We eventually got in at 11:45, 5 hours 15 minutes late.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were staying at the Ibis near the station again so checked into the room just before midnight. Not a great day!
