          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 5th June</span>
          Despite not getting to bed until after 1am, we were both wide awake by 5:30 and unable to get back to sleep. At 6:30 we went out for a walk into the centre of Munich. It is quite nice to be in Marienplatz at that time with no tourists and it is also unusual to walk round Munich being neither hungover nor drunk!
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked out as far as the Hofbräuhaus before heading back. Munich does not seem to have gone too overboard with Euro 2024 stuff but there were a few flags around so at least some evidence that a tournament is going to take place here. We stopped for breakfast at Backwerk and were back in the hotel again by 8:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 9:50, we began our journey back to Kingsclere. We walked back to the station and got the S-Bahn to the airport. By the time we had got through security, we had about 90 minutes to wait for our flight. The flight was about 25 minutes late departing so was also 25 minutes late getting into Heathrow. We were met in the car park at Heathrow by Aleks who had volunteered to pick us up and were back in Kingsclere by 4pm
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 6th June</span>
          I drove Roz to Winchester Hospital for her appointment. We had been told that the appointment could last up to four hours but within just over an hour of us getting there she had had another couple of tests and was given the all clear. This bought to an end a very traumatic 48 hours and meant that we could go home and start working out how to get back out to Germany.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both keen to get back out as soon as was reasonably possible. We found flights from Heathrow into Stuttgart for tomorrow morning that we could book reasonably cheaply with Avios points and got those booked. Roz also booked the Ibis at Heathrow for tonight and the B&B in Neu-Ulm for tomorrow. By Saturday, we should be back on schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We caught the 15:05 bus to Basingstoke and then a train to Reading. We stopped in Reading for a few beers, firstly in The Three Guineas and then The Greyfriar. We got the Elizabeth line to Hayes and Harlington and then stopped in Hayes for a few more drinks and a curry in The Botwell Inn, a better than expected Wetherspoons. At about 9:30 we got the bus to Harlington corner and walked to The Ibis.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We checked in, had our free drinks in the bar and were in bed by about 10:30. A better day than Tuesday!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 7th June</span>
          We were awake by 5:30, had showers and checked out. It was a 10 minute bus ride into Heathrow Central and by 6:45 we were through security. The 8:35 BA flight took off on time and landed in Stuttgart an hour and twenty minutes later. Getting through the airport was very quick and we were able to get the 11:28 bus to Wendlingen from just outside the airport. At Wendlingen we had a 20 minute wait for a train to Ulm then another 20 minute wait for the train to Neu-Ulm. We arrived in Neu-Ulm at 13:21, a very smooth journey compared to some in the last week or so!
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked back to the B&B where we were able to check in straight away. The car was still opposite the hotel as we had left it. We collected some of our stuff from the car, put it in the room and then went for lunch at a bakery over the road.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 3:00, we went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. We crossed The Danube into Ulm and went out past the town hall and then down to the Donauradweg. We had planned to cycle down the river from here but although the water levels have dropped a bit since we were here last week, that part of the cycle path was still closed. We headed up-river instead to Erback before turning round and heading back to Ulm. We cycled round the minster and then back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers we went out again for the evening. We had one in the square and then stopped in Bingo for a couple before crossing the river. We had booked a table at Barfüßer Hausbrauerei again at 9 o'clock. We had identical meals to this time last week. With all that we have done in the last week, it was really hard to believe that it was just a week ago that we were here.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We returned to Bingo on the way back to the hotel for a final couple of beers and were back in the hotel just after midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th June - Fridlingen to Beuron - 7.2 miles - 324 ft</span>
          We were up at 9ish and decided to try and get the 10:17 train to Fridingen from Ulm. Our original plan had been to start cycling the Donauradweg from its starting point at Donauschingen. Our trip home this week meant that we will not now be able to do that but by getting to Fridingen, we would only miss a small section of the planned route and it would put us back on our original schedule. There was only one train an hour to Fridingen and only the 10:17 went there without having to change trains.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We packed up our stuff, put what we didn't need back into the car and left the hotel at about 9:45. We cycled to Ulm station and got straight onto the train. We got spaces for our bikes and due to it being a Saturday, did not have to pay to take them with us.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The train got into Fridingen at midday. We had a ride of about half a mile to join the cycle route and started cycling along the river. Here it did not seem possible that the small river we were cycling along was the same vast river flowing through Ulm and the one that is half a mile wide by the time it gets to Vienna.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The weather was not too bad at this point. There was some light rain but it was still pleasant enough for cycling. We got through the unsurfaced section with no problems and got to Beuron about 7 miles away by 1pm. Up to this point, we had not yet had anything to eat due to our slightly hurried departure from Ulm. We stopped at a restaurant for lunch by which time the rain was getting slightly heavier. By the time we had finished eating, the rain was torrential with plenty of accompanying thunder and lightening. Cycling in it was not very appealing. We watched the rain for the best part of an hour before deciding to abandon the cycling for today and head to the train station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The station was only 300m away but I was soaked to the skin in the couple of minutes that it took to get there. The storm continued for most of the hour we waited at the station but had eased a bit by the time the train came in at 15:00. We were very relieved to be able to get our bikes on the train as spaces are limited and a lot of people would have had the same idea. By 3:30, we were in Sigmaringen where we had a room booked for the night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The rain had eased a lot my now but the one mile ride to the hotel was not particularly enjoyable and confirmed that we had made the right decision. We checked in to Hotel Gästehaus Pfefferle and were given a large apartment. All a bit old-fashioned but plenty of space and a kitchen with fridge. This was ideal as it was not the weather for being outside and we had lots of room to hang up all our wet cycling gear.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked to the supermarket getting good views of what is a very impressive castle on the way. We bought food for this evening, a few beers and a bottle of wine. We were back in the apartment by 5 and had no intention of going out again until tomorrow. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had an enjoyable evening working our way through our provisions while joining in the J-Team chat and watching England lose to Australia in the cricket. Got to bed relatively early at about 11.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 9th June - Sigmaringen to Riedlingen - 22.3 miles - 221 ft</span>
          We had breakfast included today. After eating, we packed up and started cycling again. The weather was better today but was predicted to deteriorate after 1pm so we were keen to get to Riedlingen, our next stop before then. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the hotel by 10 and had a fairly easy ride of just over 22 miles down to Riedlingen. It had started raining again for the last five miles but it was light rain, nothing like what we had yesterday. We arrived at Hotel Gudrun at about 12:30 and after finding someone to let us in, were able to check in and have our room straight away. Not quite as much space as last night but a nice enough room anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          While the rain was still not too heavy, we went for a walk round the town. It is another very nice typically German old town with all the traditional timber buildings. After our walk, we returned to the room to finish the remains of last night's food.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          By 3, the rain had stopped. Roz wanted to watch the final of the French Open so I  went out for another walk for an hour or so. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon. We were both quite tired from the events of the last week and decided that at least one night off alcohol was required. When the tennis had finished, we walked back into the old town and had kebabs for tea. After we had eaten, it was starting to rain yet again so we walked straight back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 10th June - Riedlingen to Schmiechen - 34.4 miles - 1,259 ft</span>
          The first really good days cycling of the trip so far. We had breakfast in the hotel and set off at 9. There had been a lot of rain through the night but it had finally stopped and we woke to some sun and a bit of blue sky. It was forecast to get better through the day but while it was reasonably good, we decided to get started.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Things were going well until about 2.5 miles out of Riedlingen. We came to a part of the cycle path that was under water. It was not for too long and not that deep so we both managed to get through it. Not long after this, there was another underwater section. I tried to get through but it was deeper and looked as if it went on a lot further. I turned round and went back with both feet totally soaked. I was not that keen on continuing along the path and Roz had no desire at all to attempt it. We turned round and went back to Riedlingen for a re-think. We headed out of Riedlingen along the road and cycled about 3 or 4 miles to Bechingen where we rejoined the route. This added a few miles to our journey but was worth the detour.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          From here, the path was a lot better. There was one short section that we both had to cycle through getting our feet soaked in the process, but apart from that the path remained mainly dry for the rest of the journey. The route yesterday had only been 22 miles, was fairly flat and not too spectacular. Today was a bit more challenging with more hills and was 12 miles further but the scenery was more interesting which together with the good weather made it a far more enjoyable ride. There were a few castles, abbeys and churches to look at and some lovely small towns to cycle through.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We stopped for a break at Munderkingen and had lunch in the market place at Ehingen. At Ehingen, we left the main Danube cycle path and went off on the alternative route that will eventually take us back to Ulm via Blaubeuren. We went about 10km along this route until we got to Schmiechen where we had a room booked at the Gasthof Hirsch.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We checked in just after 2. Schmiechen is a small village and there is not a lot here. We walked the mile or so to Schelkingen for ice-creams and returned to the room. There were not too many options for eating in Schmiechen on a Monday so we are in the hotel restaurant. We had very good meals with a few beers. Another enjoyable evening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 11th June - Schmiechen to Ulm- 31.71 miles - 378 ft</span>
          We left the hotel at 9. It was dry today but cold when we left. We stopped at the same Rewe as we went to yesterday  afternoon and bought breakfast which we ate on a bench just up the road. It was only about five miles from there to Bleubeuren. This was a very picturesque little town, the highlight being the Blautopf.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          This is the source of the river Blau, a natural spring that was producing about 7000 litres of water a second when we were there. The water comes up into a pool which was not as blue as it can be due to all the rain but was quite a spectacular sight nevertheless. We parked our bikes by the Abbey and walked round the spring before continuing our ride via Kloster Bleubeuren. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It another easy ride from Bleubeuren along the river into Ulm where the Blau joins the Danube. There were one or two diversions due to high water levels again but we managed to complete the journey without getting wet. We stopped in Ulm near the cathedral for 10 minutes or so and then headed off to Wiblingen. We had only done 20 miles up to this point and it was a bit early to check in. We cycled up the Iller cycle path to Wiblingen, had a look around the abbey and then came back along the Danube.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had lunch in the same bakery we ate in last Friday and then checked into the Neu-Ulm B&B for the third time in the last couple of weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After sorting out our luggage and having showers, I went out for a short walk around the centre of Neu-Ulm but did not do a lot else. We went out for the evening just before 5. After taking Roz to see the cygnets that I had found earlier, we walked into Ulm and went to look around the area with the "Crooked House" hotel. Here we found a couple of very nice places to drink. We had a couple in Gaststuben im Zunfthaus der Schiffleute and then walked to Erstes Ulmer Pfannkuchenhaus for a couple more. Both places were totally full for eating but in both we were able to get seats at the bar.
        </p>

          We had booked a table for 8:15 in Barfüßer Hausbrauerei (when we saw how busy the first two places were) and had a couple of hours in there before returning to the hotel via Bingo. Got back at about 11:15.
