          Despite not getting to bed until after 1am, we were both wide awake by 5:30 and unable to get back to sleep. At 6:30 we went out for a walk into the centre of Munich. It is quite nice to be in Marienplatz at that time with no tourists and it is also unusual to walk round Munich being neither hungover nor drunk!

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked out as far as the Hofbr√§uhaus before heading back. Munich does not seem to have gone too overboard with Euro 2024 stuff but there were a few flags around so at least some evidence that a tournament is going to take place here. We stopped for breakfast at Backwerk and were back in the hotel again by 8:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 9:50, we began our journey back to Kingsclere. We walked back to the station and got the S-Bahn to the airport. By the time we had got through security, we had about 90 minutes to wait for our flight. The flight was about 25 minutes late departing so was also 25 minutes late getting into Heathrow. We were met in the car park at Heathrow by Aleks who had volunteered to pick us up and were back in Kingsclere by 4pm

          I drove Roz to Winchester Hospital for her appointment. We had been told that the appointment could last up to four hours but within just over an hour of us getting there she had had another couple of tests and was given the all clear. This bought to an end a very traumatic 48 hours and meant that we could go home and start working out how to get back out to Germany.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both keen to get back out as soon as was reasonably possible. We found flights from Heathrow into Stuttgart for tomorrow morning that we could book reasonably cheaply with Avios points and got those booked. Roz also booked the Ibis at Heathrow for tonight and the B&B in Neu-Ulm for tomorrow. By Saturday, we should be back on schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We caught the 15:05 bus to Basingstoke and then a train to Reading. We stopped in Reading for a few beers, firstly in The Three Guineas and then The Greyfriar. We got the Elizabeth line to Hayes and Harlington and then stopped in Hayes for a few more drinks and a curry in The Botwell Inn, a better than expected Wetherspoons. At about 9:30 we got the bus to Harlington corner and walked to The Ibis.

          We checked in, had our free drinks in the bar and were in bed by about 10:30. A better day than Tuesday!

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 7th June</span>
          We were awake by 5:30, had showers and checked out. It was a 10 minute bus ride into Heathrow Central and by 6:45 we were through security.
