          Despite not getting to bed until after 1am, we were both wide awake by 5:30 and unable to get back to sleep. At 6:30 we went out for a walk into the centre of Munich. It is quite nice to be in Marienplatz at that time with no tourists and it is also unusual to walk round Munich being neither hungover nor drunk!
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked out as far as the Hofbräuhaus before heading back. Munich does not seem to have gone too overboard with Euro 2024 stuff but there were a few flags around so at least some evidence that a tournament is going to take place here. We stopped for breakfast at Backwerk and were back in the hotel again by 8:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 9:50, we began our journey back to Kingsclere. We walked back to the station and got the S-Bahn to the airport. By the time we had got through security, we had about 90 minutes to wait for our flight. The flight was about 25 minutes late departing so was also 25 minutes late getting into Heathrow. We were met in the car park at Heathrow by Aleks who had volunteered to pick us up and were back in Kingsclere by 4pm

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 6th June</span>
          I drove Roz to Winchester Hospital for her appointment. We had been told that the appointment could last up to four hours but within just over an hour of us getting there she had had another couple of tests and was given the all clear. This bought to an end a very traumatic 48 hours and meant that we could go home and start working out how to get back out to Germany.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were both keen to get back out as soon as was reasonably possible. We found flights from Heathrow into Stuttgart for tomorrow morning that we could book reasonably cheaply with Avios points and got those booked. Roz also booked the Ibis at Heathrow for tonight and the B&B in Neu-Ulm for tomorrow. By Saturday, we should be back on schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We caught the 15:05 bus to Basingstoke and then a train to Reading. We stopped in Reading for a few beers, firstly in The Three Guineas and then The Greyfriar. We got the Elizabeth line to Hayes and Harlington and then stopped in Hayes for a few more drinks and a curry in The Botwell Inn, a better than expected Wetherspoons. At about 9:30 we got the bus to Harlington corner and walked to The Ibis.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We checked in, had our free drinks in the bar and were in bed by about 10:30. A better day than Tuesday!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 7th June</span>
          We were awake by 5:30, had showers and checked out. It was a 10 minute bus ride into Heathrow Central and by 6:45 we were through security. The 8:35 BA flight took off on time and landed in Stuttgart an hour and twenty minutes later. Getting through the airport was very quick and we were able to get the 11:28 bus to Wendlingen from just outside the airport. At Wendlingen we had a 20 minute wait for a train to Ulm then another 20 minute wait for the train to Neu-Ulm. We arrived in Neu-Ulm at 13:21, a very smooth journey compared to some in the last week or so!

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked back to the B&B where we were able to check in straight away. The car was still opposite the hotel as we had left it. We collected some of our stuff from the car, put it in the room and then went for lunch at a bakery over the road.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 3:00, we went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. We crossed The Danube into Ulm and went out past the town hall and then down to the Donauradweg. We had planned to cycle down the river from here but although the water levels have dropped a bit since we were here last week, that part of the cycle path was still closed. We headed up-river instead to Erback before turning round and heading back to Ulm. We cycled round the minster and then back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers we went out again for the evening. We had one in the square before crossing the river and then stopped in Bingo for a couple. We had booked a table at Barfüßer Hausbrauerei again at 9 o'clock. We had identical meals to this time last week. With all that we have done in the last week, it was really hard to believe that it was just a week ago that we were here.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We returned to Bingo on the way back to the hotel for a final couple of beers and were back in the hotel just after midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th June</span>
          We were up at 9ish and decided to try and get the 10:17 train to Fridingen from Ulm. Our original plan had been to start cycling the Donauradweg from its starting point at Donauschingen. Our trip home this week meant that we will not now be able to do that but by getting to Fridingen, we would only miss a small section of the planned route and it would put us back on our original schedule. There was only one train an hour to Fridingen and only the 10:17 went there without having to change trains.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We packed up our stuff, put what we didn't need back into the car and left the hotel at about 9:45. We cycled to Ulm station and got straight onto the train. We got spaces for our bikes and due to it being a Saturday, did not have to pay to take them with us.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The train got into Fridingen at midday. We had a ride of about half a mile to join the cycle route and started cycling along the river. Here it did not seem possible that the small river we were cycling along was the same vast river flowing through Ulm and the one that is half a mile wide by the time it gets to Vienna.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The weather was not too bad at this point. There was some light rain but it was still pleasant enough for cycling. We got through the unsurfaced section with no problems and got to Beuron about 7 miles away by 1pm. Up to this point, we had not yet had anything to eat due to our slightly hurried departure from Ulm. We stopped at a restaurant for lunch by which time the rain was getting slightly heavier. By the time we had finished eating, the rain was torrential with plenty of accompanying thunder and lightening. Cycling in it was not very appealing. We watched the rain for the best part of an hour before deciding to abandon the cycling for today and head to the train station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The station was only 300m away but I was soaked to the skin in the couple of minutes that it took to get there. The storm continued for most of the hour we waited at the station but had eased a bit by the time the train came in at 15:00. We were very relieved to be able to get our bikes on the train as spaces are limited and a lot of people would have had the same idea. By 3:30, we were in Sigmaringen where we had a room booked for the night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The rain had eased a lot my now but the one mile ride to the hotel was not particularly enjoyable and confirmed that we had made the right decision. We checked in to Hotel Gästehaus Pfefferle and were given a large apartment. All a bit old-fashioned but plenty of space and a kitchen with fridge. This was ideal as it was not the weather for being outside and we had lots of room to hang up all our wet cycling gear.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked to the supermarket getting good views of what is a very impressive castle on the way. We bought food for this evening, a few beers and a bottle of wine. We were back in the apartment by 5 and had no intention of going out again until tomorrow. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had an enjoyable evening working our way through our provisions while joining in the J-Team chat and watching England lose to Australia in the cricket. Got to bed relatively early at about 11.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th June</span>
          We had breakfast included today. After eating, we packed up and started cycling again. The weather was better today but was predicted to deteriorate after 1pm so we were keen to get to Riedlingen, our next stop before then. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the hotel by 10 and had a fairly easy ride of just over 22 miles down to Riedlingen. It had started raining again for the last five miles but it was light rain, nothing like what we had yesterday. We arrived at Hotel Gudrun at about 12:30 and after finding someone to let us in, were able to check in and have our room straight away. Not quite as much space as last night but a nice enough room anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          While the rain was still not too heavy, we went for a walk round the town. It is another very nice typically German old town with all the traditional timber buildings. After our walk, we returned to the room to finish the remains of last night's food.
