          After breakfast we headed out to see the only one of Magdeberg's sights that we had not yet seen - the Wasserstra√üenkreuz, a 918m long canal bridge that crosses the Elba and links two major shipping canals. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the apartment on our bikes and cycled 12 miles or so up the Elbe along the Elberadweg. The bridge is considered a "miracle of modern engineering" and was quite impressive although not as spectacular or photogenic as some of the things we have seen on this trip already. We cycled back towards Magdeburg and split up on the way as I wanted to go a bit further than Roz.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I got to Magdeberg and continued up the river for another five miles or so. I had planned to go further but the path was deteriorating a bit and I could not go with any speed. I turned round and got back having done 35 miles. Roz got back not long after me having done 31.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had left-over pizza for lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around the apartment. Roz has had some sort of cold/cough on and off since the start of the tournament and I seem to have been about a week behind her. I was not feeling great today and the lack of sleep due to noise outside the apartment last night probably was not helping. I had a slight temperature and felt totally worn out.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had planned a session in the evening but I did not feel like drinking and it was probably not the best idea anyway. We did go for a couple of drinks in a beer garden near the river that Roz had spotted and then ate in Tucher Stube, one of the places we had found last night. Both were very nice places and it would have been easy to carry on drinking but by the time I had had my fourth drink I was ready for bed. We were back in the apartment by 9 and in bed by 10.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 18th July</span>
          After a slightly better night's sleep, I was feeling slightly better than I was yesterday. Still not 100% but a definite improvement. We had breakfast, and had another trip to the supermarket. We bought everything we will need for the next couple of days and replenished our stock of beer for taking home.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went out on our bikes at 11. I had wanted to do another 50 - or 60 mile ride before leaving here but as I was still not feeling at my best, so went out with Roz on her shorter ride. We went about 10 miles down the Elbe and at the point, she had planned to come away from the river and do some sort of loop back. We decided instead to just keep heading along the Elberadreg for another 5 or 6 miles before turning round.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          This proved to be a good move as this was the nicest part of the route. It was a totally flat, smooth cycle path on top of one of the river's flood defenses and a very easy 12 miles or so. We were back in Magdeberg by about 3 having completed 33 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It had been quite hot for most of the ride so we were both tired and dehydrated by the time we got back. We had lunch in the apartment and then another quiet afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had not planned on drinking anything tonight as we have a long drive tomorrow but I had really liked the beer garden we were in last night and had not really been able to enjoy it as much as I should have done due to not feeling well. We decided to go back there again this evening and once again, it was  a lovely place. We had not drunk as much as we had planned too yesterday so it did not seem too bad an idea to go back again.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We still only had five beers between us and then walked back to the apartment, picking up a pizza from Dominoes on the way. We ate the pizza with a couple of glasses of wine but were still in bed by 10.
