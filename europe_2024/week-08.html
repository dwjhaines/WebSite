          After breakfast we headed out to see the only one of Magdeberg's sights that we had not yet seen - the Wasserstra√üenkreuz, a 918m long canal bridge that crosses the Elba and links two major shipping canals. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the apartment on our bikes and cycled 12 miles or so up the Elbe along the Elberadweg. The bridge is considered a "miracle of modern engineering" and was quite impressive although not as spectacular or photogenic as some of the things we have seen on this trip already. We cycled back towards Magdeburg and split up on the way as I wanted to go a bit further than Roz.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/europe24_065.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I got to Magdeberg and continued up the river for another five miles or so. I had planned to go further but the path was deteriorating a bit and I could not go with any speed. I turned round and got back having done 35 miles. Roz got back not long after me having done 31.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had left-over pizza for lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around the apartment. Roz has had some sort of cold/cough on and off since the start of the tournament and I seem to have been about a week behind her. I was not feeling great today and the lack of sleep due to noise outside the apartment last night probably was not helping. I had a slight temperature and felt totally worn out.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had planned a session in the evening but I did not feel like drinking and it was probably not the best idea anyway. We did go for a couple of drinks in a beer garden near the river that Roz had spotted and then ate in Tucher Stube, one of the places we had found last night. Both were very nice places and it would have been easy to carry on drinking but by the time I had had my fourth drink I was ready for bed. We were back in the apartment by 9 and in bed by 10.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 18th July</span>
          After a slightly better night's sleep, I was feeling better than I was yesterday. We had breakfast, and had another trip to the supermarket. We bought everything we will need for the next couple of days and replenished our stock of beer for taking home.
