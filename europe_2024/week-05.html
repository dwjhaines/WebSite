          We were up just before 9 and walked to Backwerk for breakfast. We walked back to the room to get next seasons fixture lists which were released at 10am. After this excitement, Roz went downstairs and sat at one of the tables spending time canceling some of the reservations we had for the rest of the tournament. I am still feeling the effects of my cold so went back to bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At 1, we went out on our bikes for the first time in a couple of days. We had planned to cycle into the Netherlands and go as far as the Brand brewery. We had no intention of going to the brewery itself but it was about the distance we wanted to cycle. We somehow managed to miss the turning to the brewery and ended up in the town of Gulpen instead. This did not turn out too badly. Gulpen was a nice little place with a lively, scenic square in the middle of it. We went to Aldi and bought food for lunch which we ate in the square before cycling back to Aachen.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After showers, we both fell asleep again. The last couple of days seem to have taken it out of us. The change in the weather is good news and we can not complain about it but the heat and humidity now makes doing anything hard work, particularly when not feeling 100% to start with.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were having a day off alcohol again today. We watched the Slovakia v Romania game in the room at 6pm. A lot of games are on pay TV but we were able to watch this. Neither of us were bothered about eating in a restaurant. We considered McDonalds but ended up in Frittenwerk instead. We returned to the hotel for the Czech Republic v Turkey game. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 27th June</span>
          Today we were off to see Springsteen in Nijmegan in The Netherlands. We had booked a room just outside Venlo on the Dutch/German border about 30 minutes away from Nijmegan by train. The plan had been to get the 9:22 train to Mönchengladbach and then another train that would have got us in to Venlo by 10:56. However, when we woke up, there was already disruption on the train route. Although in theory our journey was unaffected, there were already some cancellations between Aachen and Mönchengladbach and every other train between Mönchengladbach and Venlo was canceled. We decided to go straight to the station and get on an earlier train.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          When we got to the station we were able to get straight on the 8:20 train to Mönchengladbach. This departed only ten minutes late, had plenty of space for the bikes and we were able to get seats. By the time we got to Mönchengladbach we would have had almost an hour to wait for our connection. We were only 21 miles from Venlo at this point so decided we may as well cycle the rest of the way. We had breakfast just outside the station and started cycling North. It was a bit slow going to start with as we had to keep checking directions but once Venlo became signposted it was an easy enough ride.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got to Venlo at about 12:30 and cycled out to The Camponile Hotel which was on a business park a couple of miles from the centre. This was not the greatest place we have ever stayed in but it was OK for a night, it was cheap and we were able to check straight into our room when we arrived. We had showers and cycled straight beck to the station where we locked up our bikes.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked back into the centre of Venlo which had looked quite nice as we had cycled through it earlier. I had seen a bar that I like the look of - Browersplaats - and we managed to find it again. We had a table outside and spent a couple of hours there with a few beers and a bowl of Bitterballen. We walked from there to the station and got the 15:59 train to Nijmegan. This was a bit late leaving and was further delayed by having too many people but we eventually got into Nijmegan by about 5:30. We decided to walk to Goffertpark and stop for a beer on the way but there were not too many options for drinking along the two mile walk so we ended up going straight there. We got in easily and had time for a couple of beers sat in the sun before the concert started. Slightly better conditions than in Sunderland!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The concert was excellent again. Gone from the set-list were a couple of my favourites from Sunderland but they were replaced with Cadillac Ranch and Sherry Darling so could not complain too much. The audience around us was a bit subdued initially but got going as Bruce moved into Backstreets, Because The Night, etc and they kept going for the rest of the show. We were a bit closer to the stage than we had been in Sunderland but our views were not helped by the fact that Dutch people all see to be 6' or taller! We could still see enough and once again, it had been worth paying for the front field tickets.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After the show, it was reasonably quick to get out of the field and we walked back to the station. We would have made the 23:38 train but this was canceled. The 12:08 was a few minutes late but still got us back to Venlo just after 1. We collected our bikes and cycled back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 28th June</span>
          We did not get up until 10:00 and were a bit unsure whether to cycle to Oberhausen or to go by train. We packed up our stuff and loaded up the bikes and cycled into the centre of Venlo for breakfast. The weather was ideal for cycling so we decided that we would attempt the 35 mile journey. Once again, it was all a bit slow as we had to have frequent stops to look at maps (and to photograph the Wankum sign!). The first half of the ride was nice enough but as we started getting closer to Druisburg, it was all getting a bit industrialised and not quite so scenic. We got into Oberhausen just after 4.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Our first impression of Oberhausen was not great but by the time we got to the area where our apartment is located, it was starting to look a bit better. We let ourselves into the apartment which is very nice again and went straight out to buy things from Rewe about 5 minutes walk away. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went for a short walk around the centre of Oberhausen in the evening. We found one or two places that may be OK for watching the football tomorrow but other than that, it is not hard to see why the town is twinned with Middlesbrough! We stopped to pick up a take-away pizza on the way back to the apartment and ate it with a couple of drinks while trying to plan what we are doing next week.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 29th June</span>
          We had breakfast in the apartment. The apartment we had decided on for next week came back to us and said that they had no availability so we had to have re-think about that. We ended up booking four nights in Niederlahnstein instead.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After that was sorted out, we went out on our bikes again. Roz only wanted to do a short ride so we both cycled to Essen-Borbeck and I left her there. I continued on to Gelsenkirchen, firstly to check out the route to the ground for tomorrow and then to go into the centre to collect a few copies of Free Lions. This completed, I cycled back to Oberhausen and was back in the apartment just after 3. After showering we had the leftover pizza for lunch.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After two days without football, today was the start of the second round games. We watched the Italy v Switzerland game in the apartment with a few drinks and went out as soon as it finished. We walked to Uerige Treff, one of the places we had seen last night. We had assumed that it would be packed due to Germany playing in the second game but there was hardly anyone in there at all when we arrived. It did fill up a bit by the time the game started so the atmosphere in there was quite good. We both had the herrings to eat and quite a few drinks while watching the game. We left when it closed at about midnight.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 30th June - England v Slovakia</span>
          We were up by 9ish, had breakfast, packed and left the apartment just before 11. After a week of good weather, it was back to rain and grey skies this morning but it had just about stopped by the time we left. We cycled the 5 miles to Essen-Borbeck where we had booked a room for tonight at Hotel am Schloss Borbeck. We initially attempted to check in at a similarly named hotel across the road but once we had sorted out where we were meant to be staying we were able to check in straight away. We dropped our stuff in the room, had quick showers and went straight out. At midday, we were back in Dampfe, the brewery we were in two weeks ago.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had not arranged to meet anyone else here ass most of the others are staying in Munster but not long after we had sat down, we were joined by John and Anthony. We had met John in the brewery in Samara in 2018 and he recognised us when he came in. We stayed in for almost three hours before we left them to start heading towards the ground. We had our bikes with us as we planned to cycle back after the game but decided we may as well get the S-Bahn to Gelsenkirchen Buer. We had no problems getting onto the S-Bahn with the bikes and were in Baur just after 3pm. Steve had said that they may be in Baur but in the end, they decided to stay where they were. We started cycling from the station towards the ground and found a nice beer garden to stop for a drink on the way. We got to the ground at 4:45 and locked up our bikes in a car park near to our entrance. We had time for one more beer before entering the ground.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We found Steve, Sheila, Mick and Mark Rogers in the ground and were in our seats with plenty of time for kick-off. Once again, the game was not great and after 94 minutes we were all preparing ourselves for another embarrassing defeat and accepting that we were out of the tournament. However, that all changed very quickly thanks to Bellingham and Kane and ten minutes later we were starting to think about the quarter finals. For the first time in the tournament we had something to celebrate and for the first time, we stayed at the end to applaud the players.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the stadium, found our bikes and cycled back to Borbeck. I had cycled to the ground yesterday to familiarise myself with the route and this meant it was a fairly straight-forward ride home. Neither of us had front lights but we made it back just before it got totally dark. We parked our bikes back at the hotel and walked to van Megaren, a pub that John and Anthony had told us about. They joined us about 15 minutes later and we had a very good evening.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were all quite happy after the football and there were quite a few locals in the bar when we arrived. Most of them were quite a bit older than us but all of them seemed either pissed, slightly mad or both. We stayed there until 1 am when we think it was closing and walked back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 1st July</span>
          We left the hotel at 9:45 and cycled back to Oberhausen. We had a few options for heading back to Bacharach but cycling to Oberhausen meant that we could get a direct train to Koblenz. We were trying to get the 10:33 train and got to the station with about 15 minutes to spare. Remarkably, the train came in on time and we had plenty of space to get our bikes on. It did get very full around Cologne but we had seats most of the journey and it was reasonably comfortable. We had about 20 minutes wait for our next train from Koblenz. This train was also busy but again, we were able to get our bikes on, we both had seats and the train got in to Backarach on time. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We cycled just under a mile to get back to where we had left the car and started driving towards Niederlahnstein where we have booked an apartment for the next four days. We stopped at a ReWe to buy food for the next few days and arrived at Rheinterrase apartments at 3:30. There was someone there to give us the key when we arrived and we spent about 10 minutes carrying everything up from the car.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The apartment is huge again with lounge, dining room and kitchen as well as a large terrace overlooking The Rhine which is only about 20m away. We had lunch on the terrace. By the time we had finished eating and tidied up, there was only an hour or so until the 6 o'clock game - France v Belgium. We watched that, ate tea on the terrace and then watched the Portugal v Slovenia game. Another alcohol free day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 2nd July</span>
          After breakfast, we did some washing and then spent a bit more time looking into options for the next couple of weeks. We also had to sort out tickets for the quarter-final as Steve had been unable to buy them all due to using the wrong code for Mick's ticket! 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At about 11:30, I went out on my bike. I was keen on going further than Roz again so went out before her. It was exactly 20 miles to The Lorely so it seemed a good place to turn round. It started raining at the exact moment I started cycling back and did not stop all the way. We both got back to the apartment at around 2:30, Roz having done just over 20 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Again, we did not do much for the rest of the say. There are two reasonable places to drink near where we are staying but both are closed on Monday and Tuesday so we were having a second day in a row off alcohol. We had lunch on the terrace but it was quite cold and wet in the evening so we ate inside. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It seems a bit hit and miss in Germany as to which of the Euros games are on pay TV and which ones are free to watch. Despite our tele having about 800 channels, we could not find either of tonights games so had to watch them both on Roz's iPad. The Austria v Turkey game was one of the most entertaining games so far.
