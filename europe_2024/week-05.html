          We were up just before 9 and walked to Backwerk for breakfast. We walked back to the room to get next seasons fixture lists which were released at 10am. After this excitement, Roz went downstairs and sat at one of the tables spending time cancelling some of the reservations we had for the rest of the tournament. I am still feeling the effects of my cold so went back to bed.

          At 1, we went out on our bikes for the first time in a couple of days. We had planned to cycle into the Netherlands and go as far as the Brand brewery. We had no intention of going to the brewery itself but it was about the distance we wanted to cycle. We somehow managed to miss the turning to the brewery and ended up in the town of Gulpen instead. This did not turn out too badly. Gulpen was a nice little place with a lively, scenic square in the middle of it. We went to Aldi and bought food for lunch which we ate in the square before cycling back to Aachen.

          After showers, we both fell asleep again. The last couple of days seem to have taken it out of us. The change in the weather is good news and we can not complain about it but the heat and humidity now makes doing anything hard work, particularly when not feeling 100% to start with.

          We were having a day off alcohol again today. We watched the Slovakia v Romania game in the room at 6pm. A lot of games are on pay TV but we were able to watch this. Neither of us were bothered about eating in a restaurant. We considered McDonalds but ended up in Frittenwerk instead. We returned to the hotel for the Czech Republic v Turkey game.
