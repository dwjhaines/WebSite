          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 19th June</span>
          Another day where our plans had to be significantly changed due to a combination of the weather and the inefficiency of German railways!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had breakfast on our terrace, packed up our stuff, put what we didn't want in the car and started cycling just before 10. It started raining just before we left but it was not heavy and not a problem. Instead of going up the Rhine on our side of the river, we cycled down a couple of miles and crossed over to Kaub. I had not cycled from Kaub to Rüdesheim before and that side was very good from Rüdesheim to Mainz.... so it seemed like a good idea.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Things were going well until a couple of miles after Rüdesheim. Here we came to a sign saying that the cycle path was closed due to the high water levels again. We gave it a go anyway but within about 100m, we could see that the path was totally flooded again. This was not too big a problem. We decided to cycle back to Rüdesheim and get a train. We would still have done over 20 miles on our bikes and would get to Mainz at a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got back to Rüdesheim station at 12:22 and there should have been a train to Mainz leaving at 12:23. There were a lot of people standing around waiting however, there was no sign of any train.  It was not a big station but the only DB official there did not seem to know what was going on. We realised that there were problems somewhere but as as become the norm with German rail journeys, no-one knew exactly what was happening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          They eventually announced that the 12:53 train would be coming through 45 minutes late. This eventually did come in and we finally departed from Rüdesheim at 13:42. The train went about 4km to Geisenheim, the next station and did not move for 50 minutes. At this point, we were about a mile away from where we had got to when the cycle path was closed about two and a half hours earlier.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were getting a bit fed up with everything by now and after looking at maps of my cycle ride along here last year, we realised that we were not that far from the "high water diversion". This was the route that I had accidentally taken last year back from Mainz. We got off the train and cycled on the road to Oestrich-Winkel and joined the route. From here, it was a fairly straight-forward 20 mile ride into Mainz. We eventually got to the Ibis hotel at about 5pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had planned to go into Frankfurt today, have a look at a couple of the apple-wine houses and then find somewhere to watch the Germany v Hungary game. Instead we had showers and went down to the bar and had our free drinks while watching the first half. The only other people in the bar were 13 English blokes from Worthing who had just arrived after driving down this morning. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At half time we went out. The first reasonable place with teles was an Irish bar. We watched the second half in there and then went to look for somewhere to eat. We were both hungry at this point having missed lunch but we were not bothered about eating in a restaurant as we did not have long until Scotland v Switzerland. We eventually settled on a kebab. We went to an Italian place that had a TV outside for the Scotland game and were joined by the lot from Worthing. We had one more on the way home back in the Irish bar.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 20th June - Denmark v England</span>
          We were up at 9ish and walked into the centre of Mainz where we met Mark and Steve in another branch of Cafe Extrablatt for breakfast (they staying in the B&B by the Hbf). We decided in there that we would go into Frankfurt for our pre-match drinks so, together with Shiela, caught the 11:32 S-Bahn from Mainz Hbf.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got off the train at Hauptwache, the location of the fans embassy. We collected our copies of Free Lions and went to look for somewhere to drink. This did not prove as easy as it should have been. Everywhere was very busy and getting a table was proving to be a problem. We found somewhere that said they would have a table in 15 minutes but then told us it would only be for 30 minutes. While we were waiting Roz found somewhere else just round the corner. The initial round took ages to come but the service improved after that and we were able to have a few drinks in there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the bar at about 15:15 for the 18:00 kick-off. We walked back to the previous S-Bahn stop (Konstablerwache) so we could get on the train before it filled up (which it did at Hauptwache) and got to the Stadion S-Bahn station just after 16:00. It was a 10 minute walk from the station to the ground. We lost Steve and Sheila but me, Roz and Mark stopped for a beer on the way. Mark returned to Frankfurt as he did not have a ticket for this game and we got into the ground at about 5:15 without any problems.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had seats in the front row for todays game so had perfect views of what the BBC described as a disorganised shambolic mess. A game that was right up there with the Algeria game in 2010. It was every bit as disappointing and frustrating particularly with the amount of quality we have in the squad.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          As with the previous match, we were aware that there could be problems with transport getting back to Mainz so dashed out of the ground as soon as the final whistle went. We got back to the station and onto the platform fairly easily but then had almost an hour of chaos that was as bad as any of our recent experiences with the German rail system. A train which we thought we could get on came in announced that it was not going anywhere and blocked the platform so that no other trains could go through for 40 minutes. Another disorganised shambolic mess!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Despite the problems with the trains, we were back in Mainz by 9:20. We walked back to Bistrorante L'Angolo, the Italian place we had been in last night. Mark, Steve and Sheila were already there and we were joined about an hour later by Mark and Lisa. We had pizzas while watching the Italy v Spain game and returned to the hotel when it finished and the restaurant closed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 21st June</span>
          We were up by 8ish and walked to a nearby bakery for breakfast. We returned to the hotel and waited for the weather to clear. It was another day of rain and clouds but by 9:30 it had stopped and brightened up a bit so we decided to pack up and leave to start cycling back to Bacharach. By the time we had loaded the bikes and got out of the underground car park, it was raining again. It was not too heavy so we decided to get on with it.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went slightly the wrong way meaning an extra mile or two to get to the river but the rest of the ride went very smoothly. We followed the high water diversion back to Geisenheim and then rejoined the cycle route along the Rhine back to Rüdesheim. From there it was an easy 10 miles or so back to Kaub where we got straight onto the ferry to get back to Backarach. The rain had looked as if it may get heavier as we left Mainz but it eased and stopped completely for the second half of the ride. We stopped to buy bread for lunch and were back at our apartment by 14:25.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          There are two apartments in the same building and this time we were in the smaller of the two. Probably the nicer apartment although it does not have such a good terrace. We had lunch inside the apartment and then watched the Ukraine v Slovakia game. The owner of the apartment had resolved the issues with his satellite dish since we were here last so we were able to watch the game although we both managed to fall asleep during the second half.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After the game, we walked into Bacharach and met Steve, who is staying in another apartment here and Mark & Lisa who are in their van at the camp site. We watched Poland v Austria in Hotel Cafe Burg Stahleck with a couple of drinks. After a look around the town centre, we walked out to the camp site bar, about the only place open with a tele, to watch France v The Netherlands. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 22nd June</span>
          I walked to the bakery to buy breakfast when I woke up. We ate in the apartment, loaded up the bikes again and were on our way by 10. We are not really sure exactly when we will be returning to Bacharach but the owner of the apartment seemed quite happy for us to leave the car where it was for the next week or so. We had a ride of about 32 miles down to Koblenz. It was an easy, journey with no major delays, hold-ups or floods. Once again, it was all quite scenic with plenty of castles on the way. By 1pm we were taking our photos at Deutches Eck again.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Roz had messages from the apartment owner giving us details of how to get in so we were able to let ourselves into the apartment straight away. We were staying in the same apartment that we were in last year. We locked up the bikes, put out luggage in the apartment and walked across to Rewe to buy lunch and breakfast for tomorrow. We had lunch in the apartment and did not do much else for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Steve and Mark were staying in the same place as us and had both turned up by 5ish. Phil, who we met in Georgia last year had told us he was staying in Koblenz and we had arranged to meet up with him this evening. Roz and I went out at 5:30 and found a table in the beer garden at Deutches Eck. The place was packed as Turkey were playing Portugal at 6:00 but we got a table where we could just about see one of the big screens. We were joined by the others after the start of the game. We had to stand under cover for most of the game due to rain again but it was still not a bad place to watch it.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left when the game finished and went to look for somewhere to eat and to watch the Belgium v Romania game. We ended up in another Cafe Extrablatt and had good meals in there again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 23rd June</span>
          We had breakfast in the apartment. After eating, I went out on my bike again. Roz was keen on a rest day but I wanted to do a few miles as we finally had a day of nice weather. I headed off at 10:40 while Roz went to join Mark and Steve who were having their breakfast at Cafe Extrablatt again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I crossed the river and cycled along the Moselleradweg until I had got to 15 miles. Instead of coming back along the same route, I returned along the road which was quite a nice option as the cycle path was closer to the river. I was back in Koblenz by 1:10 having done 31 miles.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We all went out again at 1:30 and walked through the old town to Deutches Eck. This time we climbed up the statue, something I had not realised was possible until yesterday. We all walked along to the cable car ticket office and after much dithering, bought return tickets for the cable car and also to get into the castle at the top. The cable car journey over The Rhine was very good as were the views from the castle at the top. The castle itself was not too exciting apart from the free bar football tables but the trip was still worth doing.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got the cable car back down again and walked back to the apartment. After sorting out a few things about our accommodation for the next week or so, Roz and I went out at about 6. We had another walk round the old town and then headed back to the beer garden. However, due to Germany playing at 9pm, the place was packed and you had to buy tickets to get in. We walked instead to Altes Kaufhaus, a nice enough place on the Moselle that sold beer from the Maximilians brewery. We had a couple in there and were joined by Mark, Steve and Phil.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had booked a table for 8:15 at the Altes Brauhaus. We met up with Mark and Lisa there and watched the first half of the Germany v Switzerland game while we all ate. The Brauhaus closed at 10pm. We had seen there opening hours but were still surprised that they would close half way through a Germany game. I walked to Cafe Extrablatt but they were also about to close so we sat outside a tapas restaurant to watch the second half. This was actually a better place to watch the football than Cafe Extrablatt so it did not work out to badly. The football was quite entertaining, particularly when Scotland got knocked out in the 10th minute of added on time!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 24th June</span>
          We were up quite early again. We had breakfast in the apartment and I went for a walk round to Deutches Eck again. By the time I had got back, Mark and Steve had come up to our apartment for their breakfast. We all agreed that we would get the 11:16 train to Cologne and then on to Aachen. Roz and I cycled to the station while Mark and Steve walked. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got there first and got to the platform. While Roz went to check to see if we needed bike tickets, our train disappeared from the boards. A few minutes later we had confirmation of yet another train cancellation. There was another train at 11:30 so in theory, this was not too big a problem. However, the cancelled train was at least twice the size of the 11:30 so there were a lot of people trying to get on. I was not expecting us to get on with our bikes but Roz managed to get on straight away and I just made it. The train was totally full and left a lot of people standing on the platform. We were not supposed to get on it with bikes but once on, there was no way of getting off even if we had wanted to.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The journey was not the most comfortable. I had to stand all the way to Cologne and both of has had to constantly try and move our bikes to let people squeeze past. We eventually got into Cologne about an hour later than we should have done at 13:40. There was a train to Aachen at 13:45 that I did not think we would make but that was a few minutes late leaving and Roz got people to help her get up bike up and down the stairs so we just made it. We eventually found the bike carriadge and although I had to stand again, there was a lot more room than on the first train. We finally got into Aachen at about 14:40 and had a short walk to the B&B hotel (the old Ibis)
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Mark and Steve, together with Sheila were all off to watch Albania v Spain in Düsseldorf. Roz and I had a couple of ideas for cycle rides but the Brand Brewery was not open on a Monday and it appeared that Café 't Vereinshoes closed early on a Monday. We were both totally worn out anyway so gave up and had a couple of hours sleep instead. I also seem to have caught the cold that Roz had last week so sleep seemed a better idea than exercise.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We went out just after 6. We walked down to the old town, had a quick look at the cathedral and the town hall and then sat outside Zum goldenen Einhorn with a few wheat beers. Monday is schnitzel day in Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb so we went there to eat. They also had good seats in front of a big screen so we stayed in there to watch the game that the others had gone to see.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a couple more in Poststübchen on the way home and got back to the hotel sometime after midnight.
