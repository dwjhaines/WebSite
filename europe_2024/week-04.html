          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 19th June</span>
          Another day where our plans had to be significantly changed due to a combination of the weather and the inefficiency of German railways!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had breakfast on our terrace, packed up our stuff, put what we didn't want in the car and started cycling just before 10. It started raining just before we left but it was not heavy and not a problem. Instead of going up the Rhine on our side of the river, we cycled down a couple of miles and crossed over to Kaub. I had not cycled from Kaub to Rüdesheim before and that side was very good from Rüdesheim to Mainz.... so it seemed like a good idea.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Things were going well until a couple of miles after Rüdesheim. Here we came to a sign saying that the cycle path was closed due to the high water levels again. We gave it a go anyway but within about 100m, we could see that the path was totally flooded again. This was not too big a problem. We decided to cycle back to Rüdesheim and get a train. We would still have done over 20 miles on our bikes and would get to Mainz at a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got back to Rüdesheim station at 12:22 and there should have been a train to Mainz leaving at 12:23. There were a lot of people standing around waiting however, there was no sign of any train.  It was not a big station but the only DB official there did not seem to know what was going on. We realised that there were problems somewhere but as as become the norm with German rail journeys, no-one knew exactly what was happening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          They eventually announced that the 12:53 train would be coming through 45 minutes late. This eventually did come in and we finally departed from Rüdesheim at 13:42. The train went about 4km to Geisenheim, the next station and did not move for 50 minutes. At this point, we were about a mile away from where we had got to when the cycle path was closed about two and a half hours earlier.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were getting a bit fed up with everything by now and after looking at maps of my cycle ride along here last year, we realised that we were not that far from the "high water diversion". This was the route that I had accidentally taken last year back from Mainz. We got off the train and cycled on the road to Oestrich-Winkel and joined the route. From here, it was a fairly straight-forward 20 mile ride into Mainz. We eventually got to the Ibis hotel at about 5pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had planned to go into Frankfurt today, have a look at a couple of the apple-wine houses and then find somewhere to watch the Germany v Hungary game. Instead we had showers and went down to the bar and had our free drinks while watching the first half. The only other people in the bar were 13 English blokes from Worthing who had just arrived after driving down this morning. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          At half time we went out. The first reasonable place with teles was an Irish bar. We watched the second half in there and then went to look for somewhere to eat. We were both hungry at this point having missed lunch but we were not bothered about eating in a restaurant as we did not have long until Scotland v Switzerland. We eventually settled on a kebab. We went to an Italian place that had a TV outside for the Scotland game and were joined by the lot from Worthing. We had one more on the way home back in the Irish bar.

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 20th June - Denmark v England</span>
          We were up at 9ish and walked into the centre of Mainz where we met Mark and Steve in another branch of Cafe Extrablatt for breakfast (they staying in the B&B by the Hbf). We decided in there that we would go into Frankfurt for our pre-match drinks so, together with Shiela, caught the 11:32 S-Bahn from Mainz Hbf.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got off the train at Hauptwache, the location of the fans embassy. We collected our copies of Free Lions and went to look for somewhere to drink. This did not prove as easy as it should have been. Everywhere was very busy and getting a table was proving to be a problem. We found somewhere that said they would have a table in 15 minutes but then told us it would only be for 30 minutes. While we were waiting Roz found somewhere else just round the corner. The initial round took ages to come but the service improved after that and we were able to have a few drinks in there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We left the bar at about 15:15 for the 18:00 kick-off. We walked back to the previous S-Bahn stop (Konstablerwache) so we could get on the train before it filled up (which it did at Hauptwache) and got to the Stadion S-Bahn station just after 16:00. It was a 10 minute walk from the station to the ground. We lost Steve and Sheila but me, Roz and Mark stopped for a beer on the way. Mark returned to Frankfurt as he did not have a ticket for this game and we got into the ground at about 5:15 without any problems.

          We had seats in the front row for todays game so had perfect views of what the BBC described as a disorganised shambolic mess. A game that was right up there with the Algeria game in 2010. It was every bit as disappointing and frustrating particularly with the amount of quality we have in the squad.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          As with the previous match, we were aware that there could be problems with transport getting back to Mainz so dashed out of the ground as soon as the final whistle went. We got back to the station and onto the platform fairly easily but then had almost an hour of chaos that was as bad as any of our recent experiences with the German rail system. A train which we thought we could get on came in announced that it was not going anywhere and blocked the platform so that no other trains could go through for 40 minutes. Another disorganised shambolic mess!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Despite the problems with the trains, we were back in Mainz by 9:20. We walked back to Bistrorante L'Angolo, the Italian place we had been in last night. Mark, Steve and Sheila were already there and we were joined about an hour later by Mark and Lisa. We had pizzas while watching the Italy v Spain game and returned to the hotel when it finished and the restaurant closed.
