          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 19th June</span>
          Another day where our plans had to be significantly changed due to a combination of the weather and the inefficiency of German railways!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had breakfast on our terrace, packed up our stuff, put what we didn't want in the car and started cycling just before 10. It started raining just before we left but it was not heavy and not a problem. Instead of going up the Rhine on our side of the river, we cycled down a couple of miles and crossed over to Kaub. I had not cycled from Kaub to Rüdesheim before and that side was very good from Rüdesheim to Mainz.... so it seemed like a good idea.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Things were going well until a couple of miles after Rüdesheim. Here we came to a sign saying that the cycle path was closed due to the high water levels again. We gave it a go anyway but within about 100m, we could see that the path was totally flooded again. This was not too big a problem. We decided to cycle back to Rüdesheim and get a train. We would still have done over 20 miles on our bikes and would get to Mainz at a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got back to Rüdesheim station at 12:22 and there should have been a train to Mainz leaving at 12:23. There were a lot of people standing around waiting however, there was no sign of any train.  It was not a big station but the only DB official there did not seem to know what was going on. We realised that there were problems somewhere but as as become the norm with German rail journeys, no-one knew exactly what was happening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          They eventually announced that the 12:53 train would be coming through 45 minutes late. This eventuallydid come in and we finally departed from Rüdesheim at 13:42. The train went about 4km to Geisenheim, the next station and did not move for 50 minutes. At this point, we were about a mile away from where we had got to when the cycle path was closed about two and a half hours earlier.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We were getting a bit fed up with everything by now and after looking at maps of my cycle ride along here last year, realised that we were not that far from the "high water diversion". This was the route that I had accidentally taken last year back from Mainz. We got off the train and cycled on the road to Oestrich-Winkel and joined the route. From here, it was a fairly straight-forward 20 mile ride into Mainz. We eventually got to the Ibis hotel at about 5pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had planned to go into Frankfurt today, have a look at a couple of the apple-wine houses and then find somewhere to watch the Germany v Hungary game. Instead we had showers and went down to the bar and had our free drinks while watching the first half. The only other people in the bar were 13 English blokes from Worthing who had just arrived after driving down this morning.
