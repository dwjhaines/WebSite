          The weather was due to get worse later in the day so after breakfast we headed straight to the station and took our bikes up to Limberg on the 9:11 train. Once again, the train was on time and we were the only two passengers with bikes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          From Limberg, we wanted to cycle back down the Lahn to Niederlahnstein, a ride we did about 15 years ago. We cycled away from the station, through the old town and made our way down to the river to pick up the Lahnradweg. The first 20 miles of the ride was all pleasant enough and quite enjoyable. After about 21 miles we came to Obernhof. Here there was a sign saying that the cycle path is closed. Apparently a section of it has fallen into the river and is taking about a year to repair. There was a diversion but this was about 12km and involved over 1000ft of ascent. The sign advised getting a train to Nassau and we took this option.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a wait of about 40 minutes for the train which took about five minutes to get to Nassau. As we left Nassau it started raining again. We still had about 14 miles to do to get back to Niederlahnstein. The rain got progressively worse as we continued cycling and the last five miles or so were particularly unpleasant. We were both totally soaked by the time we got back to the apartment.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
           Once again we did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. There was no football today but, after two days off, we did have a few drinks again. We had a couple in the apartment at about 7. I had been for a walk and found that most places nearby were closed so we ate in the restaurant under our apartment. It was just about warm enough to sit outside so we were in the beer garden overlooking the river. This place was closing at 10 so we had a few more in the apartment before bed.
        </p>

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 4th July</span>
          We were up by 9, had breakfast on the terrace and then drove to ReWe to replenish our food and drink supply.
