          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 3rd July</span>
          The weather was due to get worse later in the day so after breakfast we headed straight to the station and took our bikes up to Limberg on the 9:11 train. Once again, the train was on time and we were the only two passengers with bikes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          From Limberg, we wanted to cycle back down the Lahn to Niederlahnstein, a ride we did about 15 years ago. We cycled away from the station, through the old town and made our way down to the river to pick up the Lahnradweg. The first 20 miles of the ride was all pleasant enough and quite enjoyable. After about 21 miles we came to Obernhof. Here there was a sign saying that the cycle path is closed. Apparently a section of it has fallen into the river and is taking about a year to repair. There was a diversion but this was about 12km and involved over 1000ft of ascent. The sign advised getting a train to Nassau and we took this option.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a wait of about 40 minutes for the train which took about five minutes to get to Nassau. As we left Nassau it started raining again. We still had about 14 miles to do to get back to Niederlahnstein. The rain got progressively worse as we continued cycling and the last five miles or so were particularly unpleasant. We were both totally soaked by the time we got back to the apartment. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
           Once again we did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. There was no football today but, after two days off, we did have a few drinks again. We had a couple in the apartment at about 7. I had been for a walk and found that most places nearby were closed so we ate in the restaurant under our apartment. It was just about warm enough to sit outside so we were in the beer garden overlooking the river. This place was closing at 10 so we had a few more in the apartment before bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 4th July</span>
          We were up by 9, had breakfast on the terrace and then drove to ReWe to replenish our food and drink supply. We both went out on our bikes separately again today. I did a repeat of Tuesday's ride i.e. to the Lorely and back. Roz did 30 miles on the same route. The weather was better today. The forecast thunder storms never materealised so for the first time in a few days, we were able to complete the rides without getting soaked.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The rest of the day was similar to yesterday. We had lunch on the terrace when we were both back. Did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We were able to have a couple of drinks on the terrace before going out to eat. The Maximillian Brewery which we have visited a couple of times before is only a 10 minute walk from our apartment. It is closed Mon - Wed but we were able to go there this evening. We ate there and then walked back to the beer garden under our apartment. We had a few more drinks when we got back while watching the start of the election results.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 5th July</span>
          We had breakfast on the terrace for a final time, packed up our stuff and left the apartment at 10. We put everything in the car and then went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. I did another 25 miles along the Rhine, Roz did 15 along the Lahn. We were both back at the car by midday. We put the bikes on the back of the car and started driving back to Krefeld.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It was another uneventful journey. We had one stop for lunch and were back at the Krefeld B&B just after 3pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We met Steve in reception at 5. Sheila was not well so did not come out with us. We walked back to Cafe Extrablatt where we had a table booked for 5:30. We watched Germany getting knocked out in there and also watched the first half of France v Portugal. At half time in this game, we walked to the small bar by the station and watched the second half in there. We were joined by Bob, Gavin and one of their mates and eventually got back to the hotel at about 1:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 6th July - England v Switzerland</span>
          I was awake early and walked to the  ReWe to buy breakfast. We ate in the room and then went down to meet Steve and Sheila in reception at 10:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Krefeld is on the Düsseldorf U-Bahn system although the trams are not currently running from the Hbf. We walked instead to Krefeld Dießem which is no further from our hotel anyway and after an inevitable delay, got the tram into Düsseldorf.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We got off the tram at D-Heinrich-Heine-Allee which is about the closest station to the old town. Steve and Sheila were keen on going down to the river area to meet up with others but I was more interested in visiting the Uerige Hausbrauerei which was just about on the way. We walked there and although it was very busy (mainly with Swiss fans), we were able to get a table for an hour or so. We stayed in there until 1pm when our table was reserved from and then did continue down to the river.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The bars of the river area had been taken over by England fans and was predictably no-where near as nice as where we had just come from. After walking round for a bit looking for Bob, Gavin, etc, Roz and I gave up and returned to Uerige for another hour or so. This really is an excellent place to drink and after a few more drinks than we had planned, we finally left just before 3.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had decided to walk to the Steinstraße U-Bahn station to get a tram to the ground as it was the stop before where most of our fans would be getting on. We had assumed that we would find other bars on the way but there was not much around the station and we ended up drinking overpriced Erdinger outside an upmarket shopping centre. Not ideal but it was fine for a couple of drinks while we had about 30 minutes of heavy rain.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The U-Bahn to the ground was all OK and as usual, we got in without any problems. In the ground, we met up with Steve and Sheila as well as Mick and Mark Rogers who had come over by bus again. Once again, the game was not great. England played better than they had done in the earlier games and just enough to get to penalties but it was still not a convincing performance. However, the penalties were superb. They were taken at our end and we were three rows from the front so had a perfect view. We scored all five penalties and thanks to Pickford saving their first attempt, we had somehow made it into the semi-finals.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          After the final whistle, we stayed to watch the celebrations and then Roz and I left to get the shuttle bus back into Düsseldorf. These were reasonably well organised and we were back to the edge of the old town quite quickly. We then had to get two trams to get back to Krefeld and were back at Krefeld-Dießem by about 10:30. We we had missed the connecting bus due to the tram being late so walked back to the station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          Neither of us had eaten anything since breakfast so we had a couple of kebabs before returning to the small bar opposite the station. We were half way through our drinks when we were joined by Steve and Sheila. Despite wanting to celebrate, we were all worn out by this time so returned to the hotel after one drink.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 7th July</span>
          We met Steve and Sheila in reception at 9:30 and walked to a café by the station for breakfast. They were heading down to Stuttgart for a couple of days this afternoon. We checked out of the hotel by 11 and had a drive of about 90 minutes to Münster. We got to Münster at around 12:30. We were booked into the Novotel for a couple of nights and parked in the multi-story opposite. We were able to check straight into our room so were in by 1pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We walked over to the station to buy lunch which we ate in the room. We then went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. We were not bothered about going too far but thought we should do something after the last few days. We were a bit slow starting but eventually found a node map and completed a circular route of about 21 miles.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We did not do much else for the rest of the day. Roz wanted to watch Wimbledon in the evening. I went out for a walk around the old town which is all a bit nicer than some of the cities we have stayed in recently. There was some sort of running event through the old town so everywhere was quite busy despite there not being much open. Roz was still watching tennis by 8ish and neither of us were bothered about eating out so I picked up a couple of take-away pizzas and went back to the room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 8th July</span>
          We woke up and finished last night's pizza for breakfast. We had both planned to cycle to see the Schloss at Nordkirchen today but Roz has still not completely got rid of her cold and decided not to go that far. I decided I may as well do it anyway and headed off just after 9.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It was an easy 25 mile each way ride and the schloss itself is worth the journey. Germany is very good for cycling but this area is better again. It is very flat and has loads of cycle paths and routes. They use the node system here similar to the ones in Belgium and Holland and it is very easy to find your way round. It took me a couple of hours to get there and I spent 20 minutes or so cycling round it before heading back to Münster.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          I was back in Münster just after 1. Roz had gone off to look round some of the closer "castles" and was still some way away so I went out on my own for lunch. I bought food from the station and ate in a park before going for another walk round the old town. Roz got back at about 4 having done about 35 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a few drinks in the evening. We started with our welcome drink in the hotel bar and then walked through the old town to Gaststätte Pinkus Müller, the brewery that first brought us to Münster in 2006. This was another excellent place to drink with a good range of their own beers. We had a few in the main restaurant part and then stopped for another in the small bar next to it (where I think we were drinking the last time we were here).
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had not got round to eating anything this evening so were getting quite pissed by the time we left. We walked back towards the centre and stopped for a couple of drinks in another bar - Köpi Stuben. We were about to leave there when a group of England fans came in. Some of them were Sunderland supporters so we stayed for another while we chatted to them and then don't really remember walking back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 9th July</span>
          We were up at 9ish and walked to Backwerk by the station for breakfast.
