          The weather was due to get worse later in the day so after breakfast we headed straight to the station and took our bikes up to Limberg on the 9:11 train. Once again, the train was on time and we were the only two passengers with bikes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          From Limberg, we wanted to cycle back down the Lahn to Niederlahnstein, a ride we did about 15 years ago. We cycled away from the station, through the old town and made our way down to the river to pick up the Lahnradweg. The first 20 miles of the ride was all pleasant enough and quite enjoyable. After about 21 miles we came to Obernhof. Here there was a sign saying that the cycle path is closed. Apparently a section of it has fallen into the river and is taking about a year to repair. There was a diversion but this was about 12km and involved over 1000ft of ascent. The sign advised getting a train to Nassau and we took this option.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We had a wait of about 40 minutes for the train which took about five minutes to get to Nassau. As we left Nassau it started raining again. We still had about 14 miles to do to get back to Niederlahnstein. The rain got progressively worse as we continued cycling and the last five miles or so were particularly unpleasant. We were both totally soaked by the time we got back to the apartment.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
           Once again we did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. There was no football today but, after two days off, we did have a few drinks again. We had a couple in the apartment at about 7. I had been for a walk and found that most places nearby were closed so we ate in the restaurant under our apartment. It was just about warm enough to sit outside so we were in the beer garden overlooking the river. This place was closing at 10 so we had a few more in the apartment before bed.

          We were up by 9, had breakfast on the terrace and then drove to ReWe to replenish our food and drink supply. We both went out on our bikes separately again today. I did a repeat of Tuesday's ride i.e. to the Lorely and back. Roz did 30 miles on the same route. The weather was better today. The forecast thunder storms never materealised so for the first time in a few days, we were able to complete the rides without getting soaked.

        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          The rest of the day was similar to yesterday. We had lunch on the terrace when we were both back. Did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We were able to have a couple of drinks on the terrace before going out to eat. The Maximillian Brewery which we have visited a couple of times before is only a 10 minute walk from our apartment. It is closed Mon - Wed but we were able to go there this evening. We ate there and then walked back to the beer garden under our apartment. We had a few more drinks when we got back while watching the start of the election results.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 5th July</span>
          We had breakfast on the terrace for a final time, packed up our stuff and left the apartment at 10. We put everything in the car and then went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. I did another 25 miles along the Rhine, Roz did 15 along the Lahn. We were both back at the car by midday. We put the bikes on the back of the car and started driving back to Krefeld.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          It was another uneventful journey. We had one stop for lunch and were back at the Krefeld B&B just after 3pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text-gs">
          We met Steve in reception at 5. Sheila was not well so did not come out with us. We walked back to Cafe Extrablatt where we had a table booked for 5:30. We watched Germany getting knocked out in there and also watched the first half of France v Portugal. At half time in this game, we walked to the small bar by the station and watched the second half in there. We were joined by Bob, Gavin and one of their mates and eventually got back to the hotel at about 1:30.
