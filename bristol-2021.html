            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 17th July - Kingsclere to Swindon - 34.07 miles - 1,622 ft</span> We were supposed to be traveling to Europe this week for a six day trip to Belgium or Germany. However, this became yet another trip that was postponed due to covid so we had to make do with our Plan B - a six day cycle ride to Bristol and back. Most of this journey is along the NCN 4 a cycle route that runs all the way from Fishguard to Greenwich and goes through Newbury, Bath and Bristol. Swansea had been due to play a friendly in Swindon today so the plan was to cycle to Swindon, go to the game and then rejoin the route at Devizes tomorrow. The match was canceled earlier in the week but we had a hotel booked in Swindon and we could not really come up with a better alternative so we decided to stick with this plan anyway.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-001.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We packed up the panniers again, put everything onto the bikes and left Kingsclere just before 11:30. The first half of today's journey was my usual route to Hungerford via Kintbury. We stopped to eat our sandwiches by the canal in Hungerford and then continued North-West to Aldbourne where we had our first pub stop of the trip. We stopped at The Crown, a very pleasant Cask Marque pub in a small village.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a pint in there we continued the last section of the journey to Swindon. This was another ten miles and involved going up and over The Ridgeway. This climb proved to be not as bad as expected and by 4:25, we arrived at The Holiday Inn Express in the centre of Swindon.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed out for the evening at 5ish. Swindon city centre is not the greatest of places but I had found a few pubs that sounded OK. We started at The Glue Pot just round the corner from the hotel. "Closed until Monday" - not a good start!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed from there to the old town, about a mile away. There were plenty of crap pubs along the way but we eventually found our way to The Tuppenny, an excellent Cask Marque pub with a big range of bottles and craft beers and a couple of decent cask beers. We had a couple of beers in there and a portion of Nepalese momos before moving to The Hop Kettle Tap & Brew, a micro pub a few doors down the road. We had a couple in there before going a bit further down the road to another cask marque pub. This looked pretty poor so we went back to The Hop Inn opposite the previous pub.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			This was another very good pub so we stayed in there a while. We were able to sit in a corner and join in the video call while getting through a few pints of excellent beer. At about 9:30, we decided to walk back to an Italian restaurant we had seen by our hotel. Unfortunately, this was closing as we got there. The pubs in that area were pretty crap and we could not be bothered to walk back to the old town so we got a takeaway pizza and a couple of bottles of wine and returned to the video call from our room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 18th July - Swindon to Bath - 55.70 miles - 1,490 ft</span> Today was going to be our longest day of cycling and we managed to coincide it with the hottest day of the year so far. The forecast was for 30° and it certainly felt that hot for a lot of the day.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel just after 11 and cycled East out of Swindon to meet up with NCN 45. This runs North - South and the plan was to follow it all the way down to NCN 4. We got over the M4 and up to the top of The Ridgeway without any problems but then managed to lose the route. This did not make a huge difference to our plans but meant going via Marlborough which we had not intended to do. When we arrived in Marlborough, it became obvious that we were going to be cycling further than expected. We had done 14 miles already and still had at least 38 to go. We had used Google maps to work out that we should be doing 42 miles today without considering that the NCN routes do not go the shortest way. Roz was a bit despondent at this point!
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-002.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We headed West out of Marlborough and after a few miles, picked up NCN 45 again. We followed this South until we got to NCN 4 and continued West to Devizes. By the time we reached Devizes, we were hot and dehydrated and still had another 20 miles to go. We stopped in the centre for much needed water and ate the remains of last night's pizza that we had carried with us. We left Devizes and joined the Kennet and Avon Canal at the top of the Caen Hill Locks, a spectacular system of about 17 locks in quick succession. After stopping for photos, we continued for the last part of the journey to Bath.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			It was still very hot at this time but the journey along the side of the canal was mainly flat or slightly downhill so it was fairly easy going with very pleasant scenery along the way. It was slow going as the canal path was unsurfaced and quite narrow but by just after 5 we had made it as far as Bradford-on-Avon. We stopped for drinks at The Canal Tavern (a pint and a half of Horizon and three pints of water!) and then did the last 9.5 miles into Bath. We found our accommodation (Student Castle Apartments) easily enough and checked in at about 7pm. It was a remarkably good apartment considering it was supposed to be student accommodation although we could have done with air-conditioning!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			After much needed showers, we headed off to sample the pubs of Bath. We were only a few minutes walk from the centre and there were a lot of cask marque pubs around so the plan was to go round a few of these. The first one, The Ale House, had no real ale, the second was Greene King so we abandoned that idea and went for one in The Grapes. We then went to The Bath Brew House which had excellent beer but terrible service. We tried to order food there but nothing seemed to be available so we gave up after a couple of pints and went to The Bath Stable, a "pizza and cider" restaurant. This was a great find. We had excellent pizzas and a few pints of their 6.5% cider. We stopped for one more on the way home and got back to the apartment at about 11:30.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-003.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 18th July - Bath to Bristol - 25.58 miles - 524 ft</span> Still hot today but a much easier days cycling than yesterday. It is only 15 miles from Bath to Bristol along a disused railway line. We extended the ride with a detour round the Two Tunnels Circuit. This meant leaving Bath and going back the way we came yesterday for five miles along NCN 4. We headed South from this point on another NCN route mainly so that we could cycle through two old railway tunnels, the first of which was just over a mile long. We had been told about these by Dave and it was definitely worth the detour.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back in Bath, we rejoined NCN 4 and had a relatively easy 14 mile ride into Bristol where we arrived at 3:15. NCN 4 goes right past our hotel - The Leonardo Hotel Bristol Glassfields - making it quite easy to find and we checked in for two nights.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We headed out again at 4:45 to begin another pub crawl - this one with trips to the bar! (Today was the first day where we were allowed to go to the bar again after a couple of months of table service only) It was about half a mile to The Old Fish Market, a Fullers pub we have been to many times. Next stop was The King Street Brew House which appeared to be part of the same chain as the one in Bath. The beer here was excellent again and improved by the fact that we did not have to wait for table service. After a couple in there, we went to two more pubs on King Street - The Llandoger Trow and The Old Duke. After one in each of those, we continued up the road to The Beer Emporium. We had planned to continue our pub crawl towards The Ostrich but The Beer Emporium was an excellent pub and we got stuck in there for three rounds.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we had not eaten enough for the amount we were drinking so were both getting quite pissed by this stage. We started heading back towards the hotel stopping at The Left Handed Giant, a brew pub that we had noticed on our way out. This was another very good spot and we had at least two more in here. We would have stopped in Ye Shakespeare for a final drink but, as with the last time we tried to visit it was closed. Instead we bought food and a bottle of wine from Tesco and returned to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 19th July - The Severn Bridge - 36.08 miles - 1,708 ft</span> We bought breakfast from Tesco and ate it sat in the park over the river from The Left Handed Giant before returning to the room. It was another very hot day but with not a lot else we wanted to do, we decided to go out on the bikes and cycle to the Severn Bridge. NCN 4 goes over the bridge into Wales so we left the hotel and continued along the route.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-004.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Getting out of Bristol was hard work due to the number of hills. Roz's bike has a problem meaning that she can not use the low gears which did not make it any easier for her. After about nine miles, we left NCN 4 and joined the Avon Cycle Way as the signs suggested that this was a shorter route to the bridge. As it was, it was slightly longer but almost totally flat from there so probably the correct choice. We got onto the bridge after 18 miles. We had considered cycling all the way across but it was still hot and we had cycled slightly further to get there than expected so we took a few photos and cycled back to Bristol the same way. We had a couple of stops on the way back. The first was at Olveston where we bought lunch and  more water and then another when we were two miles from the hotel at The Brew House and Kitchen at Cotham. Made it back to the hotel just before 6pm
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Roz was keen on having a quieter night tonight as we have another 35 mile ride tomorrow and the temperature is predicted to be 30° again. We resisted the temptation to visit more pubs and went for a meal at Zero Degrees. I am not a great fan of Zero Degrees but we did have excellent pizzas again with a four pint jug of their very good American Pale Ale. Back in the hotel by 9pm
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 20th July - Bristol to Devizes- 38.94 miles - 678 ft</span> 	Although we cycled further today than we did yesterday, it was a much easier day as the route was fairly flat all the way. We left the hotel at about 9:30, rejoined NCN 4 and headed NE out of Bristol. There was a Morrison's three miles along the route with a load of picnic tables at the side of the path so we stopped there for breakfast before completing the 15 mile trip to Bath.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-005.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We stopped in the centre of Bath for more liquid and jelly babies before rejoining The Kennett and Avon Canal for the twenty or so miles to Devizes. We stopped for a beer at The Three Magpies just before the start of the locks and had another photo stop at the bottom of the locks. It was easier to find a good spot for pictures going this way as we were facing up the hill with all the locks in front of us. When we had finished taking photos, we continued up the hill to the top of the locks and then had about another mile to go to along the canal to get to our accommodation, which for the second night running is right on NCN 4.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Tonight, we are in an apartment which is very nice but not ideal in the current heat wave. It is on a busy main road so will be noisy with the windows open but will be very warm with them closed. It is however, fine for one night. We had not eaten since breakfast so walked to the nearest supermarket (Morrison's again) and bought stuff to make sandwiches. We returned to the apartment to eat them before having showers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We headed out on our pub crawl of Devizes just after 6. First stop was The British Lion a few minutes walk away. This was a very good pub and we had a couple of pints sat in their garden before moving on. Next stop was The Southgate. This was an excellent Hopback Brewery pub slightly out of town. Again, we had a couple in here before walking back to the market place in the centre. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Their were four cask marque pubs in this area and the plan was to go them all but it did not quite go to plan. First on the list was the Wetherspoons which was not great but did have decent beer. The Pelican and The White Bear were closed and The Castle only had bottled Horizon. Instead, we had a drink in The Black Swan, another in The Three Crowns and then returned to The British Lion until it closed just after 10. We returned to the apartment and drank the bottle of wine we had bought earlier.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 21st July - Devizes to Marlborough - 19.23 miles - 675 ft</span> A relatively easy ride today. We left the apartment after eating breakfast just after 10:00 and rejoined NCN 4 at the canal path behind where we were staying. We stayed by the canal for less than a mile before getting back onto the roads. We headed back to Marlborough the opposite way to the route we came in on last Sunday. We stayed on NCN 4 until Woodborough, headed North on NCN 45 before completing the last few miles on roads that are not part of the cycling network.
	    </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-006.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			The route took us past three of Wiltshire's white horses. We had seen one on Pewsey Down on Sunday but had gone fast downhill past it without realising how close to it was there. We had seen it later on but from quite a long way away. Going up the hill gave us a much better view. The other two, the ones at Devizes and Marlborough we had completely missed on Sunday.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived at our final stop for this trip, The Bear at Marlborough, just after midday. We put our bikes in a room at the back of the pub and were told that our room would be ready in 15 minutes. We wandered round the centre before returning to the pub and checking in. I went out and bought lunch which we ate in the room but we did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon. The cycling, the beer and the heat of the last few days seems to have totally worn us out!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We started this evenings pub crawl at 4. The beer in the first three pubs were not great. We had a 3B in the bar downstairs and then walked to The Lamb. This was a Wadworths pub but they did not have Horizon so had to have a Henry IPA. The Castle and Ball was a Greene King pub with no alternatives to the Greene King beers so we left without having a drink. Things got better after this. The next pub, The Royal Oak was also Greene King but they did have Ramsbury Gold so we sat outside and had a couple there. The Marlborough had the same beer so we had another in there. The Wellington Arms was probably the best pub of the night with a few more beers from the Ramsbury brewery including a 4.6% Mango IPA. We stayed in there for three drinks before moving to the last pub, The Green Dragon, another Wadworths pub that did have Horizon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			As we had done all of Marlborough's pubs, we decided it was time to eat and went for a curry. Had an excellent meal and a couple of bottles of wine before returning to the room. We got another bottle to drink in the room but this was not really needed as we were asleep within about 10 minutes of getting back!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 22nd July - Marlborough to Kingsclere - 29.79 miles - 1,881 ft</span> We had breakfast in the room and started the final leg of our journey at 10:20. Today was quite a bit cooler than it has been for most of the week and it made a big difference to the cycling. Although we climbed more today than on any other day, it felt considerably easier.	
	    </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We left Marlborough on the A4, a long uphill to start the day. At the top we turned off the road for the 2.5 mile descent through Savernake Forest. We followed the road down to Great Bedwyn where we joined up with NCN 4 again and continued to Little Bedwyn. After looking round the outside of White House Cottage, we continued along the route to Hungerford where we stopped for drinks and more jelly babies. We did the last 16 miles from Hungerford without any issues and were back in Kingsclere by about 2pm.
