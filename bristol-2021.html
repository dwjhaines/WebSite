            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 17th July - Kingsclere to Swindon - 34.07 miles - 1,622 ft</span> We were supposed to be traveling to Europe this week for a six day trip to Belgium or Germany. However, this became yet another trip that was postponed due to covid so we had to make do with our Plan B - a six day cycle ride to Bristol and back. Most of this journey is along the NCN 4 a cycle route that runs all the way from Fishguard to Greenwich and goes through Newbury, Bath and Bristol. Swansea had been due to play a friendly in Swindon today so the plan was to cycle to Swindon, go to the game and then rejoin the route at Devizes tomorrow. The match was canceled earlier in the week but we had a hotel booked in Swindon and we could not really come up with a better alternative so we decided to stick with this plan anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
			We packed up the panniers again, put everything onto the bikes and left Kingsclere just before 11:30. The first half of todays journey was my usual route to Hungerford via Kintbury. We stopped to eat our sandwiches by the canal in Hungerford and then continued North-West to Aldbourne where we had our first pub stop of the trip. We stopped at The Crown, a very pleasant Cask Marque pub in a small village.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a pint in there we continued the last section of the journey to Swindon. This was another ten miles and involved going up and over The Ridgeway. This climb proved to be not as bad as expected and by 4:25, we arrived at The Holiday Inn Express in the centre of Swindon.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed out for the evening at 5ish. Swindon city centre is not the greatest of places but I had found a few pubs that sounded OK. We started at The Glue Pot just round the corner from the hotel. "Closed until Monday" - not a good start!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed from there to the old town, about a mile away. There were plenty of crap pubs along the way but we eventually found our way to The Tuppenny an excellent cask marque pub with a big range of bottles and craft beers and a couple of decent cask beers. We had a couple of beers in there and a portion of Nepalese momos before moving to The Hop Kettle Tap & Brew, a micro pub a few doors down the road. We had a couple in there before going a bit further down the road to another cask marque pub. This looked pretty poor so we went back to The Hop Inn opposite the previous pub.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			This was another very good pub so we stayed in there a while. We were able to sit in a corner and join in the video call while getting through a few pints of excellent beer. At about 9:30, we decided to walk back to an Italian restaurant we had seen by our hotel. Unfortunately, this was closing as we got there. The pubs in that area were pretty crap and we could not be bothered to walk back to the old town so we got a takeaway pizza and a couple of bottles of wine and returned to the video call from our room.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 18th July - Swindon to Bath - 55.70 miles - 1,490 ft</span> Today was going to be our longest day of cycling and we managed to coincide it with the hottest day of the year so far. The forecast was for 30° and it certainly felt that hot for a lot of the day.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel just after 11 and cycled East out of Swindon to meet up with NCN 45. This runs North - South and the plan was to follow it all the way down to NCN 4. We got over the M4 and up to the top of The Ridgeway without any problems but then managed to lose the route. This did not make a huge difference to our plans but meant going via Marlborough which we had not intended to do. When we arrived in Marlborough, it became obvious that we were going to be cycling further than expected. We had done 14 miles already and still had at least 38 to go. We had used Google maps to work out that we should be doing 42 miles today without considering that the NCN routes do not go the shortest way. Roz was a bit despondent at this point!
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/bristol2021/bristol-002.jpg"></div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We headed West out of Marlborough and after a few miles, picked up NCN 45 again. We followed this South until we got to NCN 4 and continued West to Devizes. By the time we reached Devizes, we were hot and dehydrated. We stopped in the centre for much needed water and ate the remains of last night's pizza that we had carried with us. We left Devizes and joined the Kennet and Avon Canal at the top of the Caen Hill Locks, a spectacular system of about 17 locks in quick succession. After stopping for photos, we continued for the last part of the journey to Bath.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			It was still very hot at this time but the journey along the side of the canal was mainly flat or slightly downhill so it was fairly easy going with very pleasant scenery along the way. It was slow going as the canal path was unsurfaced and quite narrow but by just after 5 we had made it as far as Bradford-on-Avon. We stopped for drinks at The Canal Tavern (one pint of Horizon and two pints of water) and then did the last 9.5 miles into Bath. We found our accommodation (Student Castle Apartments) easily enough and checked in at about 7pm. It was a remarkably good apartment considering it was supposed to be student accommodation although we could have done with air-conditioning!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			After much needed showers, we headed off to sample the pubs of Bath. We were only a few minutes walk from the centre and there were a lot of cask marque pubs around so the plan was to go round a few of these. The first one, The Ale House, had no real ale, the second was Greene King so we abandoned that idea and went for one in The Grapes. We then went to The Bath Brew House which had excellent beer but terrible service. We tried to order food there but nothing seemed to be available so we gave up after a couple of pints and went to The Bath Stable, a "pizza and cider" restaurant. This was a great find. We had excellent pizzas and a few pints of their 6.5% cider. We stopped for one more on the way home and got back to the apartment at about 11:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Monday 18th July - Bath to Bristol - 25.58 miles - 524 ft</span> Still hot today but a much easier days cycling than yesterday. It is only 15 miles from Bath to Bristol along a disused railway line. We extended the ride with a detour round the Two Tunnels Circuit. This meant leaving Bath and going back the way we came yesterday for five miles along NCN 4. We headed South from this point on another NCN route mainly so that we could cycle through two old railway tunnels, the first of which was just over a mile long. We had been told about these by Dave and it was definitely worth the detour.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back in Bath, we rejoined NCN 4 and had a relatively easy 14 mile ride into Bristol where we arrived at 3:15. NCN 4 goes right past our hotel - The Leonardo Hotel Bristol Glassfields - making it quite easy to find and we checked in for two nights.
