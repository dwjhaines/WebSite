              We started this trip with a visit to Wembley for England's game against Malta. We left Kingsclere at midday and drove to the Ibis at Wembley. We checked in and had our free drink and then had a 55 minute bus journey to Harrow on the Hill. We spent a couple of hours in the Wetherspoons near the station and then got the tube to Wembley Park. Sheila had booked a table for five at a curry house near the station. She turned up late with her nephew and Steve failed to arrive due to heavy traffic but we had another couple of drinks and a very good meal before making our way to the ground.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We met Steve in the ground as well as Jer and his daughter. Not for the first time, the game itself was the low point of the day with today being particularly poor. Unlike most of the crowd, we stayed until the final whistle before walking back to Steve's car at Sudbury tube station. Steve gave us a lift back to Heathrow and we were back in the hotel by about 11:30.

              We were up at 6ish and checked out of the hotel at about 6:45. We had a ten minute drive to Terminal 2 where we left the car with the Blue Circle Meet and Greet. Getting through security was quite quick today and by about 7:15 we were sat in departures with our breakfast. We were due to get the 8:30 Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt where we had a 50 minute connection time for our onward flight to Skopje.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               Shortly after we had finished eating, we started to get messages from Lufthansa telling us that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes and we were going to miss our connection. We spoke to someone at the Lufthansa service desk but they could not really do a lot apart from tell us to go to Frankfurt and try and sort it out there. We were told that there were 19 other people also going to Skopje which did increase the chances of them holding the onward flight but we boarded the plane to Frankfurt not really knowing where we were going to end up today. The flight eventually took off at 9:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Frankfurt at 11:30 and were off the plane at 11:50 - the scheduled departure time of our flight to Skopje. The flight had been held for us. We had a walk of about two minutes from the arrival gate to the departure gate and by midday, we were on the plane. This flight was fairly full, mainly with England fans who had got to Frankfurt via other routes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Skopje about 15 minutes late and were quickly through immigration. We took money out of the ATM and bought tickets for the 3pm airport bus into the centre. We got off at the first stop and had a walk of about 10 minutes to our apartment. We were met outside and shown into a very nice apartment with plenty of space for our stay of four days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We went straight out to buy a few provisions for the net couple of days and returned to the apartment for showers. We went out for the evening at 5:30. We walked back to the river, took a few photos of the ornate bridges and walked up into the old town. We headed first for The Old Town Brewery. This had been good when we visited last time but the beer was not great this time so we moved on after one drink. "Beer House" was just about next door and had better beer. It was quite empty in there when we arrived but quite a few England fans turned up throughout the evening and it became quite lively. We had four rounds of drinks in there before deciding it was time to go and eat.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We had no idea how strong the beer that we had been drinking was but decided that it must have been fairly strong as I was a lot more pissed than expected by now. We walked back across the river to the area near our apartment where there are a few restaurants. We could not get in to the first one we tried but were able to get a table in the second. We had very good meals and a litre and a half of wine all for under Â£30. Got back to the apartment at about 10:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th November</span>
              A bit of a later start today. We had not bought anything for breakfast so went out at about 10:30 and walked to the area by the river with all the bars and restaurants. We had breakfast/lunch at Plaza de Toros and carried on walking round the few sights that we wanted to see. We stopped for a few photos in Macedonia Square and walked away from the river to the Mother Theresa House and then back to the Stone Bridge.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We crossed the river and spent half an hour or so wandering round the shops of the old bazaar and then into the castle. After admiring the views from there, we walked back to the apartment stopping at the Holiday Inn on the way to pick up our tickets for tomorrow.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We had a couple of glasses of wine in the apartment before going out for the evening. We returned to Beer House for a couple and then walked back to Macedonia Square. Most of the restaurants near the apartment are closed on a Sunday so we ate at the craft beer bar in the square. The beer here was not that good but the food and wine was excellent and it was another enjoyable meal. We did find one place that was open on the way back so stopped for another litre of wine before returning to the apartment.
