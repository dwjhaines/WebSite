              We started this trip with a visit to Wembley for England's game against Malta. We left Kingsclere at midday and drove to the Ibis at Wembley. We checked in and had our free drink and then had a 55 minute bus journey to Harrow on the Hill. We spent a couple of hours in the Wetherspoons near the station and then got the tube to Wembley Park. Sheila had booked a table for five at a curry house near the station. She turned up late with her nephew and Steve failed to arrive due to heavy traffic but we had another couple of drinks and a very good meal before making our way to the ground.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We met Steve in the ground as well as Jer and his daughter. Not for the first time, the game itself was the low point of the day with today being particularly poor. Unlike most of the crowd, we stayed until the final whistle before walking back to Steve's car at Sudbury tube station. Steve gave us a lift back to Heathrow and we were back in the hotel by about 11:30.

              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 18th November</span>
              We were up at 6ish and checked out of the hotel at about 6:45. We had a ten minute drive to Terminal 2 where we left the car with the Blue Circle Meet and Greet. Getting through security was quite quick today and by about 7:15 we were sat in departures with our breakfast. We were due to get the 8:30 Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt where we had a 50 minute connection time for our onward flight to Skopje.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               Shortly after we had finished eating, we started to get messages from Lufthansa telling us that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes and we were going to miss our connection. We spoke to someone at the Lufthansa service desk but they could not really do a lot apart from tell us to go to Frankfurt and try and sort it out there. We were told that there were 19 other people also going to Skopje which did increase the chances of them holding the onward flight but we boarded the plane to Frankfurt not really knowing where we were going to end up today. The flight eventually took off at 9:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Frankfurt at 11:30 and were off the plane at 11:50 - the scheduled departure time of our flight to Skopje. The flight had been held for us. We had a walk of about two minutes from the arrival gate to the departure gate and by midday, we were on the plane. This flight was fairly full, mainly with England fans who had got to Frankfurt via other routes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Skopje about 15 minutes late and were quickly through immigration. We took money out of the ATM and bought tickets for the 3pm airport bus into the centre. We got off at the first stop and had a walk of about 10 minutes to our apartment. We were met outside and shown into a very nice apartment with plenty of space for our stay of four days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We went straight out to buy a few provisions for the next couple of days and returned to the apartment for showers. We went out for the evening at 5:30. We walked back to the river, took a few photos of the ornate bridges and walked up into the old town. We headed first for The Old Town Brewery. This had been good when we visited last time but the beer was not great this time so we moved on after one drink. "Beer House" was just about next door and had better beer. It was quite empty in there when we arrived but quite a few England fans turned up throughout the evening and it became quite lively. We had four rounds of drinks in there before deciding it was time to go and eat.
            </p>

               We had no idea how strong the beer that we had been drinking was but decided that it must have been fairly strong as I was a lot more pissed than expected by now. We walked back across the river to the area near our apartment where there are a few restaurants. We could not get in to the first one we tried but were able to get a table in the second. We had very good meals and a litre and a half of wine all for under Â£30. Got back to the apartment at about 10:30
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th November</span>
              A bit of a later start today. We had not bought anything for breakfast so went out at about 10:30 and walked to the area by the river with all the bars and restaurants. We had breakfast/lunch at Plaza de Toros and carried on walking round the few sights that we wanted to see. We stopped for a few photos in Macedonia Square and walked away from the river to the Mother Theresa House and then back to the Stone Bridge.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We crossed the river and spent half an hour or so wandering round the shops of the old bazaar and then into the castle. After admiring the views from there, we walked back to the apartment stopping at the Holiday Inn on the way to pick up our tickets for tomorrow.

               We had a couple of glasses of wine in the apartment before going out for the evening. We returned to Beer House for a couple and then walked back to Macedonia Square. Most of the restaurants near the apartment are closed on a Sunday so we ate at the craft beer bar in the square. The beer here was not that good but the food and wine was excellent and it was another enjoyable meal. We did find one place that was open on the way back so stopped for another litre of wine before returning to the apartment.

              Roz went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We went out again at 11 and had a walk along the river as far as the football stadium. We walked round the ground and then back into the centre. We had booked a hire car for the next couple of days and had arranged to pick it up from the Marriott Hotel, just off Macedonia Square. The hotel was cordoned off when we arrived but we were let in and told to go to the 1st floor where the Sixt office was. As we stood waiting for someone to serve us, Gareth Southgate and the England squad appeared and walked past us. After all this excitement, we collected the car and drove it back to the apartment. We had a few issues trying to find somewhere to park but eventually left it in a space just over the road.

              We went out for the day at 2:30. There was an unnecessarily large police presence around the town today and the area by the river with all the bars and restaurants was closed off to everyone except England fans. This meant that this area was not too busy but we walked through it anyway and headed back to Beer House. This was quite busy when we got there but we got a table and the service was still good. We were joined in there by James, one of the Palace lot who used to go regularly to England games but who we had not seen for a few years. We had a few rounds in there before walking back to the river area where we met Steve, Mick, Mark and Sheila in Plaza de Toros.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We ate in there again and had a few more drinks before making our way to the ground, a 15 minute walk away. We got into the ground fairly easily and were in our seats about 45 minutes before kick-off. Four of us had very good seats behind the goal, Mark was in the home end and I'm not sure where Sheila ended up. As usual, the game was the low-point of the day. We were kept in the ground for about 30 minutes after the final whistle for no obvious reason and walked back to the apartment by about midnight.

              The reason we had picked up the hire car yesterday is that we wanted to visit the Four Paws Bear Sanctuary in Kosovo. The sanctuary is just East of Pristina about 60 miles from Skopje. We left the apartment just after 9, stopped at the supermarket to buy food for breakfast and started driving North. We crossed into Kosovo without any problems and had a brand new motorway to ourselves for most of the journey. We got to the bear sanctuary at about 11:15.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had been to a bear sanctuary in Greece before but this was a better experience. There were no guided tours during the week in winter so we just paid our â¬2.50 each and wandered round on our own. Things started quite slowly and we were relieved when we saw our first bear. Things improved a bit after that and we had a few really good bear sightings. We were able to get much closer to them than we had done in Greece and they did not seem that bothered by us being there. We saw a total of eight of the twenty bears that are at the sanctuary, a higher number than we were expecting. The whole thing was very enjoyable and well worth the trip from Skopje.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had a reasonably straightforward journey back to Skopje. The traffic when we got back into the centre was fairly heavy but we were back at the apartment not long after 3:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After showers, we had a couple of glasses of wine before going out for our last evening here. We walked back up to the Beer House but they had sold out of the draft pale ale and they were charging more than yesterday for their bottles. We tried the brewery again but they still only had one beer on tap so we found another bar and settled for a few glasses of wine. When we left there, we walked back to the restaurant round the corner from the apartment that we had eaten in on Saturday. Good meals again and another litre and a half of wine. We returned to the apartment to finish the wine we had there and had a relatively early night.
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 22nd November</span>
              We had quite a bit of time to kill today as we were not due to fly until 3pm. We went out for a walk just after 10 and went back to Plaza de Toros for another late breakfast/early lunch. After eating we returned to the apartment stopping to buy a few things from the supermarket on the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We left the apartment at midday and drove the 10 miles or so to the airport. We returned the hire car and had a couple of hours to wait for the 15:00 flight to Frankfurt. The flight left on time and we were in Frankfurt just over two hours later. We were booked on the 20:00 flight back to London. We had quite a long trek across the airport and tried, without success to get on the 18:00. We were not sure if it was full or down to the fact that we had economy tickets, but either way, it meant sitting and waiting for two hours for our connection.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The connection was also on time and arrived in London slightly early just after 8:00. We got through Heathrow quite quickly and the car was returned to us not long after getting to the car park. Although not a great time to be getting home, it did mean that the M25 was relatively clear and we were back in Kingsclere before 10:00.
