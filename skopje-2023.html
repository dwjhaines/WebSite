              We started this trip with a visit to Wembley for England's game against Malta. We left Kingsclere at midday and drove to the Ibis at Wembley. We checked in and had our free drink and then had a 55 minute bus journey to Harrow on the Hill. We spent a couple of hours in the Wetherspoons near the station and then got the tube to Wembley Park. Sheila had booked a table for five at a curry house near the station. She turned up late with her nephew and Steve failed to arrive due to heavy traffic but we had another couple of drinks and a very good meal before making our way to the ground.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We met Steve in the ground as well as Jer and his daughter. Not for the first time, the game itself was the low point of the day with today being particularly poor. Unlike most of the crowd, we stayed until the final whistle before walking back to Steve's car at Sudbury tube station. Steve gave us a lift back to Heathrow and we were back in the hotel by about 11:30.

              We were up at 6ish and checked out of the hotel at about 6:45. We had a ten minute drive to Terminal 2 where we left the car with the Blue Circle Meet and Greet. Getting through security was quite quick today and by about 7:15 we were sat in departures with our breakfast. We were due to get the 8:30 Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt where we had a 50 minute connection time for our onward flight to Skopje.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               Shortly after we had finished eating, we started to get messages from Lufthansa telling us that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes and we were going to miss our connection. We spoke to someone at the Lufthansa service desk but they could not really do a lot apart from tell us to go to Frankfurt and try and sort it out there. We were told that there were 19 other people also going to Skopje which did increase the chances of them holding the onward flight but we boarded the plane to Frankfurt not really knowing where we were going to end up today. The flight eventually took off at 9:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Frankfurt at 11:30 and were off the plane at 11:50 - the scheduled departure time of our flight to Skopje. The flight had been held for us. We had a walk of about two minutes from the arrival gate to the departure gate and by midday, we were on the plane. This flight was fairly full, mainly with England fans who had got to Frankfurt via other routes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We landed in Skopje about 15 minutes late and were quickly through immigration. We took money out of the ATM and bought tickets for the 3pm airport bus into the centre. We got off at the first stop and had a walk of about 10 minutes to our apartment. We were met outside and shown into a very nice apartment with plenty of space for our stay of four days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
               We went straight out to buy a few provisions for the net couple of days and returned to the apartment for showers.
