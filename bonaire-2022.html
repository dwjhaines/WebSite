            We left Kingsclere at 1:45 and headed up to Heathrow. We no longer needed PCR tests to get into Bonaire but we do still need Lateral Flow tests. Once again, it was easier to stay at the Heathrow Ibis as this is still only £50 a night. We checked in at 14:40 and went straight out to the Collinson Covid-19 test centre which was only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There were no other customers there so we were in and out in about five minutes. We returned to the hotel for our free drink in the bar and got our negative results while we were in there.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided that tonight we would go out in Twickenham and tick off the Cask Marque pubs there. We got the bus to Feltham where we missed the train. Instead of standing around waiting for the next one, we went into the Wetherspoons for a couple of halves before getting the 17:16 train to Twickenham where we arrived about 5 minutes later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We started our pub crawl at The George which was a crap Greene King pub with no real ale at all. We did not stay! Next stop was The Three Kings which was my favourite pub of the night. It was a nice pub and had Naked Ladies so we were both quite content in there. We walked from there to The Fox which was OK but a lot more expensive than other pubs in the area. Next stop was The Barmy Arms which was nice enough but only had Greene King IPA. Again we did stop. We continued walking to The Royal Oak - Roz's favourite of the night. This again had Naked Ladies so we stayed for a couple. The final pub of the session was the Wetherspoons. I was starting to struggle a bit by this stage. My body does not seem that good at dealing with alcohol following covid and I was getting tired. We had a pint and a half each, bought sandwiches from Sainsbury's and returned to Feltham. We got the bus straight back to the hotel and returned to the room for a couple of glasses of wine while watching Middlesbrough V Spurs. I fell asleep before the end.

            Spent a lot of today regretting last night's session. It seemed to set my covid recovery back by about a week which I really had not been expecting. I did not sleep well, my cough had got a lot worse and I was totally knackered, Ideal for a 20 - 21 hour journey to Bonaire. We were up at 6:00 had quick showers and left the hotel at about 6:30. We drove to Heathrow where we were met by someone from Giant Meet & Greet. We left the car with him, and checked in. The document checks were just about non-existent. It took a bit of time getting through security (things are getting back to normal) but we had time to buy breakfast before heading to the gate. The flight to Amsterdam left on time at about 8:45 and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later. We had an hour or so sat in seats or wandering round the airport before our traditional pre-Bonaire beer in "Taste of the Lowlands". We just had the one in here before heading to the gate for the 1:45 flight to Bonaire.

		<p class="diary-text">
			The flight left about 30 minutes late and was quite full but Roz had managed to get extra leg room seats so the journey was not as bad as it could have been. We had a couple of bottles of wine with the meal. Roz carried on and had a couple more while watching films while I tried to get as much sleep as I could. Today we were getting to Bonaire a lot later than last time. The flight was scheduled for a couple of hours later, it was late leaving and we had to stop for an hour and a half in Aruba. All not ideal in the state I was in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We landed in Bonaire just before 10. The queues for document checks here were not too bad considering the number of people arriving. Our luggage appeared a few minutes  after we had gone through immigration and we headed out of the airport. We were met outside the airport by someone from Bonaire Rent A Car and shown to the pick-up truck that we will have for the next three weeks. We put our luggage in the truck and she drove us back to the office to fill out the paperwork, pay for the truck, etc. By 10:30 we were on our way and finally arrived at Sand Dollar at about 10:45. We unpacked a few things, had something to eat and were in bed not much later.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 3rd March</span>
            We had thought of starting to dive today but given the mess I was in yesterday thought it better to have a recovery day and start tomorrow.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We could not get either of the one-bedroom apartments that we have stayed in before at Sand Dollar so were in A15 for the first time. Overall, this is probably not as nice as some of the other units we have stayed in before but is fine. It has a comfortable settee for me to sleep on and the balcony is very nice. We are only staying here nine night so it will be fine for that time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few things to do today. Every time I did anything I needed to lie down on the settee for twenty minutes or so to recover. Despite this, we did manage to get everything done. First on the list was a trip to the Chinese supermarket to buy stuff for breakfast. We returned from there and ate on the balcony. 
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz went off to lie in the sun for an hour while I recovered on the settee. At 11:00 we went to check in at the dive centre. The woman who checked us in was a lot friendlier than the one who was here last time. We filled in all our forms, payed for the diving and picked up our weight belts. All ready to go tomorrow!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At about 12:30, we went to The Warehouse to stock up on food for the next week or so. We were back at the apartment by 1:15 and had lunch on the balcony before my next sleep. At 4ish, I was able to sort out all the camera stuff ready for tomorrow. Roz went to lie in the sun again in the afternoon while I spent more time on the settee.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			That was about it for me today. We did go and look at the not too spectacular sunset but I spent the rest of the day in the apartment. We ate pasta on the balcony for tea and had an early night (very early in my case!)

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 4th March</span>
            Two dives today. We were up at 7. I was still not feeling great but decided to give it a go. We had breakfast 1 and headed down to the pier to dive Bari Reef. I was quite nervous about diving in my current state but once in the water, everything was fine. The dive was pretty good and we were pleasantly surprised to see that the three frog fish that we saw here in November were all still in roughly the same place. I was also quite pleased to find that the water was not as cold as I was expecting. We had been told that the temperature was 26°c but my computer showed 27 for most of the dive and I was not as cold as I had expected to be. One thing that was noticeable was that my air consumption has got a lot worse, I assume due to the covid. We have done two hour dives here but despite not going below 12m, we had to end the dive after an hour as I was low on air. I don't think we are going to beat last year's average dive time of 93 minutes! Despite this, it was a relief that I could still dive without any problems.

		<p class="diary-text">
			After the dive, we had breakfast 2 on the balcony. Roz then went to lie in the sun while I returned to the settee. At 2:30, we headed down to Salt Pier. (Before going, Roz booked herself onto tomorrow's boat trip. I am definitely not up to three or four dives a day at the moment so she may as well do a couple of dives without me.) I was unsure about how sensible doing another dive was but again, once in the water, I was fine. Again my dive time was limited so after just over an hour I got out leaving Roz to play with the turtles. We saw two on the way out but she saw seven on the way back.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear at Port Bonaire and returned to Sand Dollar with a stop at The Warehouse on the way. By this time I was totally knackered. I was determined not to go to sleep but failed miserably and slept fairly solidly for about three hours. The planned evening meal was canceled and we had a couple of slices of toast with cheese instead. I was in bed not long after 8.

            Woke up feeling slightly better but the cough seems to have got worse. We had a course of slightly out-of-date Amoxicillin in the medical kit so I decided to start taking them. I don't think this can do any harm and hopefully it will start to clear up the cough

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz's boat was due to depart at 8:00. After breakfast, we wandered down to the pier with her gear.  The boat turned up about 15 minutes late and left 5 minutes later. This worked out to have been a good thing to do. She had two good dives at Klein Bonaire seeing seven turtles and a good octopus. It gave me a chance to relax in the apartment and catch up on things like my log book and this web site. I was also able to follow the first half of the football before heading back to the pier to meet the boat.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The boat got back at 12:30. We put her gear into the car and returned to the apartment for lunch. At 2:30 we headed for The Cliff for my firs dive of the day. Still not 100% right but a nice enough dive with one of the sea-horses from last time in  the same place and a couple of green turtles. When I got to 60 minutes, I got out leaving Roz to spend an extra 10 minutes looking for turtles in the shallows. We were back at Sand Dollar by about 4:30. Roz had considered doing a solo dive on Bari Reef but decided to put his off until tomorrow.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 6th March</span>
            As with yesterday, I woke up feeling slightly better but the Amoxicillin has not had any impact on the cough yet.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a couple of slices of toast and headed down to the pier to dive Bari Reef again. This turned into an excellent dive. I had put an extra 1lb on my weight belt. We were supposed to be at 11m to look at the frog fish but I was not concentrating on my depth and dropped to almost 16m. This proved to be quite lucky as the female frog fish was down at this depth and we probably would have missed her if I had not added the weight. We also found the male in the usual place        
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had read on ScubaBoard that there was a fourth frog fish on the reef near to where the third one is so we headed in that direction. Before we had got too far, we spotted a hawksbill turtle, the same one we had seen a couple of times at The Cliff last year. Just like last year, it did not move with any great speed and we were able to stay with it all the way back to the pier. I was on 70 minutes by this time and decided to call it a day. Roz stayed with it for another 50 minutes meaning she was with it for 90 minutes in total.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text"> 
			We returned to the apartment for breakfast and did not do too much for the rest of the morning. Roz went to lie in the sun while I stayed on the settee apart from a brief trip to the Dive Friends Retail Store to buy an octopus holder. We had lunch on the balcony again and headed off towards Salt Pier again just before 2. We had another stop at the Dive Friends shop as I had been told that there was someone there who may be able to fix my camera housing. For the last couple of days, I have not been able to turn the mode dial underwater. They seemed unsure if they could do anything but within a couple of minutes it became obvious what the problem was. A couple of days ago, there had been a few drops of water in the housing. I had not thought that much about it but the silica gel sachet had obviously got wet and expanded meaning that it no longer fits where it usually goes and was causing the camera to be too tight against the housing. Removing the sachet fixed the problem. An easy if slightly embarrassing fix!
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz sorted out tanks while I was in the shop and we were on our way South after a few minutes. As we approached Salt Pier, we could see that a ship had docked there meaning we will not be able to dive it probably until Friday or Saturday. We continued South to Margate Bay instead as it is a relatively easy entry here. We did a 60 minute dive and saw a couple of green turtles. For the first part of the dive, I felt better underwater than on any dive so far although I still struggled a bit on the way back.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We drove straight back to the Dive Friends shop at Sand Dollar where I washed my gear as I had finished diving for the day. Roz had decided to try a solo dive for the first time. We went back to the apartment and then Roz headed back to the pier at about 5:15. She had another good dive here and managed to find the fourth frog fish. The first two were no-where to be seen but she found the third one and the fourth was near-by.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After we had put her gear in the equipment room we returned to the apartment where we had planned to have take-away kebabs for tea. Roz went over to get them at 8 only to find that the shop closes at 8 on a Sunday. Will try again tomorrow. We had pasta instead and once again, I was in bed just after 9.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 7th March</span>
            Once again, I woke up feeling slightly better but with no improvement to the cough. I decided that I should not dive this morning and that I needed to see a dive doctor to check that I am fit to dive. I really should have done this before we started diving but better late than never! I think that after having covid a fit to dive certificate is needed for our dive insurance to be valid.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast, I went over to the Bon Bida medical centre just over the road from where we are staying. After a lot of wandering around, I found the reception for MedCare and about 20 minutes later came away with a 1:30 appointment.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few things we needed to do again today. We headed off in the truck at 10. First stop was an ice-cream at Gio's. We had a quick look around the town and then returned to the car-hire office. We were not very happy with the service we had got from them. It appears that when we made the booking, they knew that the truck we wanted was unavailable despite telling us that it was. They had upgraded us to a newer vehicle which was totally unsuitable for diving from (there is no room for a tank rack in the back) and charged us an extra $84 without telling us. We had not got very far complaining by e-mail so decided to pay them a visit. Fortunately, the Dutch owner was there and was aware that they had got something wrong. He told us that we could change vehicles on Wednesday and he would continue to look into the price difference. Not too bad an outcome.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had another visit to The Warehouse to replace a few things we were out of and were back at Sand Dollar just before midday. We had lunch on the balcony before I headed back to Bon Bida for my 1:30 appointment. The doctor was pretty good and went through a whole load of tests before telling me basically that there is nothing wrong with me. He said that there was nothing wrong with my lungs and the cough was probably being caused by the lingering effects of covid, the poor air quality currently on Bonaire and the effects of breathing dry compressed air. Should clear up in a few days apparently. This is probably one of the worse coughs I have ever had and I was not really expecting to be told that there was nothing wrong with me. It seems unlikely that it will just clear up on its own but we will see!

			Back at the apartment I decided that despite being certified as being fit to dive, it would be a good idea to have a day off diving. I walked over the road to buy Strepsils but spent most of the rest of the day on the settee again.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At 4:30, Roz went off for another solo dive on Bari Reef. She managed to find yesterday's turtle a few minutes into the dive and was able to spend over an hour with it again. She also saw three of the frog fish as the turtle headed North past them all.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 8th March</span>
            A bit of a strange night. At 10ish, I woke up coughing and the cough was as bad as it has been, possibly as bad as any cough I have had before. I managed to get back to sleep but was coughing badly again just before midnight so got up and went to lie on the settee again. Here I managed to sleep solidly until 5. By the time I got up at 6, there were definite signs that the cough was getting better. It was much looser and each cough was a lot less painful. Not getting too excited yet but things certainly looking slightly better.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz was up just after 7 and after a couple of slices of toast, we headed down to Bari Reef for the first dive of the day. This proved to be a very good dive again. We found the female frog fish again and after a while, realised that the male was just beneath her. We then headed off to look for the other two. Roz found number three in the same spot as last night at which point, her new favourite hawksbill appeared. She stayed with the turtle while I carried on to see if I could find the fourth. This proved very easy as it was just beside the big mooring block. After a couple of photos, I returned to Roz and the turtle. We spent the rest of the dive drifting along the reef. Once again, we were close to the pier when I was keen to go up so I left Roz down there and ended my dive. I managed 78 minutes, my longest dive here yet on this trip. I took my gear back to the car and went back to the room. Roz reappeared about 50 minutes later.

		<p class="diary-text">
			We had our breakfast and then I spent an hour or so catching up on sleep before driving up to The Cliff for our second dive. Still just the one sea-horse and Roz had a brief sighting of a green turtle after I had got out. We returned to Sand Dollar for lunch with a brief stop at The Chinese supermarket on the way.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch on the balcony after which I returned to the settee to recover while following the football which kicked off at 3:45 Bonaire time. Roz went off just after 4 for another solo dive on Bari Reef. I went down to meet her at 6:30. She had managed to find all four frog fish but had been unable to find the turtle this time. Once she had sorted out her gear, we drove to Captain Don's to get take-away pizzas. The restaurant and bar were probably even busier than when we were here in October. We had a wait of just over 30 minutes for the pizzas which we took back to Sand Dollar to eat on the balcony. Cough still seems to be getting slightly better!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 9th March</span>
            Did not move to the settee until 1am. Managed to get a few hours of decent sleep. The cough does seem to be getting better but not with any great speed. The morning was fairly similar to yesterday. We could only find three frog-fish this morning and there was no sign of the turtle.

			At midday we drove to Dive Friends Yellow Submarine and did a dive from there. It was similar to previous dives here i.e. all nice enough without seeing anything too spectacular. We had a slight current to swim into on the way back and a found this very tiring. I don't think we would even have noticed that there was a current usually but any small amount of effort seems to wear me out at the moment and it was quite a relief to be be back at the entry point. We returned to the apartment to eat the leftover pizza for lunch and then headed off to change our truck over.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			This visit did not go as well as the one on Monday. The Dutch owner was not there leaving us to deal with local staff who are totally useless and were almost certainly responsible for getting us into this mess in the first place. Our replacement truck was not there - apparently it is at the garage. Their customer service skills are non-existent and they did not seem too bothered about the whole thing. We gave up arguing as it was totally pointless. They had been told to give us our $84 refund so we at least did give us that back. They also gave us a tank rack that did fit in the back so things are a bit better. Apparently they will email us when the replacement truck is ready.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to the apartment where inevitably, I did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Roz did another solo Bari Reef dive. She saw the two smaller frog-fish but no sign of the turtle. We had pasta on the balcony again in the evening. I managed to stay awake until 10pm!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 10th March</span>
            A better night's sleep than I have had for a while. I don't know if this is because the cough is actually getting better or if it is just the effect of the cough mixture I have bought. Either way it does seem slightly positive.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided to do two dives down South this morning. The original plan had been to do Vista Blue, then Salt Pier but on the way there, Roz decided she would rather do Salt Pier first. We were in the water by 8:20. Normal sort of dive here although I made it all the way to the Southernmost section today (something I had not managed last time) I saw a couple of turtles on the way in and one on the way back. When we found the first one, I left Roz again and got out. The sea was rougher this morning so entry/exit not quite as easy as it can be although it was just about manageable. Roz got out about 30 minutes after me. We changed tanks and continued South to Vista Blue.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a dive of just over an hour here. Nice enough as usual without seeing anything too spectacular although we did have a brief sighting of a green turtle at the start of the dive. We drove back to Sand Dollar and put all our gear in the equipment room. When we turned into Sand Dollar, we saw Ilsa and were able to have a word with her for the fist time since we arrived. We returned to the room and after showers, had lunch on the balcony.

			Similar after noon to yesterday. I did not do a lot. Roz went off for another solo dive on Bari Reef. Still no turtle! We went out to eat in the evening for the first time since getting here. Breeze n Bites were still doing their $10 burger offer on Thursdays. We went to this three times last year - the first two times were very good, but on the third we had got up and left because of the poor service. Tonight, everything was pretty good again. We had to wait about 10 - 15 minutes until our table was ready but we did get one of the best tables in the restaurant, right on the front by the sea. We did not have to wait long for our order to be taken and the food arrived not long after. The burgers were excellent again so a very enjoyable evening. Still back and in bed before 10pm!

            We were up at 6 as Roz was keen on an early dive on Bari Reef. I had been considering going as well but decided against it at the last minute. She had another good dive. Only two frog fish and no turtle but she did see an eagle ray.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Today we were changing both our accommodation and our truck. We packed everything up by 10 and carried it all over to Ilsa's office apart from our dive gear which got put in the truck. We checked out of Sand Dollar and drove to the car hire office. Our truck was here this time and the change-over went reasonably smoothly. We now have the truck that we ordered. It is older and covered in dents and scratches but a lot easier to dive from. We transferred all our dive gear between the trucks, completed all the paperwork and continued South to Salt Pier (with a stop to pick up tanks from Port Bonaire along the way).
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At Salt Pier, we went in at a different place to usual. Yesterday's entry/exit had been quite tough and we had heard about a sandy entry just South of the pier. This was pretty good. It was further South than the Southernmost part of the pier meaning a slightly longer swim to the pier itself but it was a lot easier getting in and out. Another nice enough dive with an excellent encounter with a small octopus in the middle of the pier. I managed a dive of just over 80 minutes while Roz stayed in and played with the turtles a while longer.

			We were both out of the water just after 1. We drove to The Warehouse to buy a case of Bright and a few other things and then drove back to the dive centre. We washed all our gear and left it in the equipment room and then sat around waiting for the woman from Sunwise who was going to show us into our apartment. She turned up just before 3 and we all went upstairs to "Parrotfish". This was a lovely apartment. It was all a bit more modern than where we have come from but the best thing about it is the balcony. We knew it would be good and it was every bit as good as expected, looking right down at the dive pier with Klein Bonaire in the background. The only bad thing about the view today was that it was very grey and drizzley so we were not seeing it at its best. We had to wait 10 minutes for the rain to stop before we could get our stuff in from the car
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once it had dried up a bit, we drove back to Sand Dollar to collect our luggage and moved everything in. One of the reasons I had only done one dive today is so that I would not be too tired for this evening. This plan seemed to have failed as once I had unpacked and showered, I was totally knackered and had to go to sleep for 90 minutes.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had booked a table at Captain Don's for 8:30 and had a few drinks on the balcony before going - my first alcohol since getting here. When it was time to leave, it was raining heavily again so we decided to drive. We somehow managed to get past security and got a space in Captain Don's car park - something we don't think is allowed for non-residents. Good service again tonight apart from the delay in the delivery of Roz's Summer Bug. I only had one more beer with the meal so was able to drive back. Another early night.

            We had planned to have a day off diving today although Roz decided she would probably do another evening dive on Bari Reef. We had a late breakfast on the balcony and then headed to The Warehouse to get most of what we will need for the next 12 days. We were back just after the start of the football at 11:00 and followed that for a couple of hours - Roz on the balcony and me on the settee. We stayed in those positions until about 2:30 when we went over the road to try out a new ice-cream shop (very good) and more cough mixture. At 3:30 we joined the weekly video call for an hour. At 4:30 we said goodbye and headed down to the pier. By this time I had decided that I would go as well.

			We had quite an enjoyable dive. We found the smaller of the two frog fish - the big one has not been seen for a few days now. We headed to the area where the other two were and could not find either of them until a snorkeler pointed out the smaller of the two. He was quite a way from where he should have been so we got to see him move along the reef for a few minutes. I ended the dive after 71 minutes while Roz stayed down and managed to spend five minutes with a green turtle.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			In the evening we ate the remains of last night's pizza on the balcony.

            Back to two dives today. We loaded our gear and four tanks into the truck and headed South to Salt Pier again. Once again, we chose to use the Southern entry/exit point which was even easier today due to the higher tide. Again it was a good dive here. Going in at the Southern end means that we are not in so much of a hurry as we are not doing the pier in both directions. We can take our time looking for things before heading back into the shallows. We did drop down to about 25m between the two Southernmost parts of the pier to look for a sea-horse without success. I managed my longest dive so far - 81 minutes and it was also the first time that I have enjoyed the whole dive. Usually once I start coughing, I am in pain and keen to get out. I am still coughing but a lot less and it is not hurting as much. Roz stayed with the turtles after I had exited and saw more here than on any dive before here.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed slightly North to the next site Aquarius chosen because it is another easy entry. We stayed on the inner reef. Nice enough dive without seeing anything too spectacular. After we had driven back, I washed my gear as that it is for me for today. We collected four more tanks for tomorrow's dives and went back to the apartment for showers and then lunch. I spent the rest of the afternoon on the settee. Roz went off for another solo dive on Bari Reef at 4:15. Two frog fish again this time although it was frog-fish 4 instead of frog-fish 3 which we saw yesterday. Still no sign of the turtle.

			Spent the evening on the balcony watching a large group of divers preparing for their night dive. They all arrived at Sand Dollar a couple of days ago and seem to spend a lot more time getting ready than they spend underwater. All quite entertaining. Had pasta for tea.

            We had breakfast on the balcony, collected our gear and headed South again. We had planned to do two dives - Salt Pier and Pink Beach. Salt Pier was as good as ever but by the time I came out, I was not really feeling up to another dive straight away. Instead we returned to the apartment. Roz went off and did another solo dive on Bari Reef and had another 20 minutes with the hawksbill that we have not seen for a few days. No frog fish at all this time. By 4ish, I had just about recovered and we went and dived The Cliff. Roz went down to photograph the one sea-horse that seems to be left there while I stayed above 10m most of the dive.

			We had booked a table at Captain Don's for 8:30. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before going and walked there this time instead of going by car. It took over and hour to get our pizzas tonight but this was just about compensated for by the fact that they made Roz two Pina Coladas instead of one and gave her the second on the house. Probably the latest night of the trip so far as we were not back at Den Laman until after 10. Well past my bed time!!

            Same plan as yesterday and this time, we did manage to do two dives down South. We looked at the entry at Angel City but the waves were quite big and neither of us fancied it. We continued to Salt Pier instead. Not so many turtles for Roz at Salt Pier today although the vis was not as good so they may have just been harder to find. After I had got out, I was told by a VIP Diving guide about two frog-fish under the centre structure. When Roz got out, we considered going back in again to look for them but decided to leave it until tomorrow. Bad move!

		<p class="diary-text">
			We continued South to Pink Beach, another site with an easy sandy entry. We messed up our navigation and failed to find the buoy line but other than that it was a nice enough dive. As we drove away from Pink Beach, we noticed a large ship heading in the direction of Salt Pier meaning our search for the frog-fish is going to be delayed by a few days.		
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After lunch on the balcony, I fell asleep on the settee. Roz went off for another solo dive on Bari Reef at 4ish and had another 85 minutes with her turtle. Today was the first day that I started getting really fed up with what appears to be long covid. I am OK diving but getting out of the water and walking to the car leaves me totally out of breath. The coughing is not as painful as it was but it is still there constantly. I also want to out looking for frog-fish and turtles instead of lying on the settee for half the day. Two dives and I am barely capable of doing anything else all day as I am left with no energy at all. There does not seem to be anything I can do but give it time but I really thought I would have seen more signs of improvement by now.
        </p>

            Roz was up before 6 to do an early morning dive on Bari Reef. She did not see her hawksbill but saw two of the frog-fish and two green turtles. After breakfast we went to Something Special for my first dive of the day. This was a really nice dive. I prefer the coral here to the Southern sites and there is no 10 minute swim to the top of the reef. Very easy entry as well. Towards the end of the dive we saw our second hawksbill of the trip. We saw it for a few minutes before it went up for air. We were told afterwards that there was a frog-fish in the area where we had first seen the turtle but we had managed to miss it. Will come back tomorrow!

			For the second dive we went in at Buddy's. We swam North to Captain Don's before turning round. We got back to the entry point after almost an hour. I got out and Roz continued back to Bari. She had another sighting of her hawksbill on the way back as well as the two frog fish again. The two bigger frog-fish have not been seen for a few days now.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After lunch it was back to the settee for me. Roz sat on the balcony before heading off for a night dive on Bari Reef.

            Woke up feeling slightly better although the cough seems slightly worse. Roz was up before 6 for another early morning dive on Bari Reef. Still just the two smaller of the frog fish but she did see a couple of green turtles again. After breakfast we headed back to Something Special. Roz managed to spot the frog-fish within a few minutes of getting in. It was a very nice dive although the second half was starting to get spoiled by my cough which was quite painful today underwater. I got out after 62 minutes and left Roz down there for a bit longer.

		<p class="diary-text">
			I decided to call it a day at that point. The second dive of the day is usually a lot worse than the first for coughing and getting back into the water again did not really appeal much after the first dive. At 1ish, I drove Roz to The Cliff so that she could swim from there back to Bari for a bit of a change. She got back in two hours seeing the two frog fish and a brief sighting of another hawksbill along the way.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			It was back to Breeze n Bites in the evening for Burger night. It was no-where near as busy tonight as last week and the service was remarkably good. Still not a late night.

            We both did the first dive of the day at Bari Reef. We had breakfast on the balcony and were in the water just after 8.  A very nice dive again. Still just the two small from fish - the two bigger ones do seem to have disappeared. No turtles.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, I decided that one dive would be enough for today. I think if I do one dive a day my health seems to slightly improve. Doing two seems slightly too much for me and leaves me completely worn out. For Roz's second dive, I drove her to Something Special and collected her from Yellow Submarine two hours later. At 4:30, she went off for another dive on Bari Reef

			In the evening, we went back to Breeze and Bites. On Fridays they offer the catch of the day or steak for two and a bottle of wine for $55. This was an excellent meal. We both chose to have the fish which turned out to be a good choice. We both really enjoyed the meal ... and the wine of course. We seem to be getting to know some of the staff now and once again, the service was excellent.

            I spent most of the night sleeping outside on the balcony in one of the chairs. I think sleeping in an upright position slightly helped and there was some improvement in the cough. We started the day with a video call with my mum and sister as it is my mum's birthday. This all worked reasonably successfully. After the call, we had breakfast and then headed down to Salt Pier which had reopened again.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We parked near the easy sandy entry again...... and then proceeded to completely mess up our entry. Roz got in OK but I got knocked off my feet by a big wave. As I was knocked over, my weight belt came off. I thought that I had lost something but could not work out what it was. After checking all my gear was still in place I carried on going out and joined Roz. As we were were about to descend, Roz suggested that it was my weight belt that I had lost. How I had not worked this out myself I don't know but we both went in to look for it. Roz went in ahead of me, missed the weight belt and then got knocked over by another big wave. She was in the shallows so could not get up  on her own. I found the belt and then managed to get Roz to her feet and carry her gear back to the car. We had a 5 minute pause before trying again.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The second attempt was a lot more successful and we were soon swimming out towards the pier. Another very good dive here and we managed to find the green frog-fish (someone else was photographing it). Roz decided that there was too much surge in the shallows to go looking for turtles and it was probably also a good idea for us to exit together!

            I spent most of the night on the balcony again. Not sure how much good it is doing but probably can not do any harm. We had breakfast on the balcony and then had a couple of hours of not doing much. I had planned to have a day off diving today but at around midday, we headed down to the pier for a dive on Bari Reef. It was another very professional looking entry from myself as I managed to go down without turning my air on. Apart from that, it was a very nice dive. We saw two frog-fish, the smaller one of the first pair and the larger of the second pair.

            We did two dives down South this morning. Roz had planned on an early Bari Reef dive again but decided that she would prefer to get to Salt Pier earlier instead. We managed to enter in a slightly more dignified manner this morning with no loss of equipment and no falling over. A good dive again. Roz managed to find the green frog fish as well as an excellently coloured octopus. In the shallows, we could only find one turtle but had a few minutes with it before heading back to the entry point.

			For dive 2, we did Aquarius again. We are choosing this site because of the easy entry but I do prefer it to a lot of the Southern sites. Again, an enjoyable enough dive without seeing anything too spectacular. Two dives meant that I spent most of the rest of the afternoon on the settee. I took Roz to Something Special for her third dive of the day and picked her up a couple of hours later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			That was the end of the days diving. In the evening we had talked about going to Breeze n Bites but their menu is not as good value when they are not doing their specials nights and we were both quite tired. Ended up getting a kebab from over the road instead.

		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st March</span>
            First dive of the day was on Bari Reef and it turned into a very good dive. Roz had been talking to someone about the frog-fish situation before we went in. Apparently the female of our first pair has run off with a smaller black frog-fish which is why she has not been seen for a while. We were told about a small cream coloured frog-fish near to the second pair. We went in at exactly 8am.
		</p> 
		<p class="diary-text">
			It took while to find the first one but Roz eventually spotted him. We moved over to the area of the second pair. I eventually spotted one of them but then Roz realised there were three frog-fish all just about on the same rock - the two yellow ones and the cream one that we had been told about. The cream one was ever so cute and made a change from all the other frog-fish in the area which are roughly the same colour. I got out after 68 minutes leaving Roz down there for another half an hour or so.

			For the second dive of the day it was back to Salt Pier. Similar dive dive to yesterdays with Roz doing an excellent job of spotting the green frog-fish again. Conditions were slightly calmer today so at the end of the dive, so I left her to look for turtles while I swam back to the entry point. She appeared about 40 - 50 minutes later having seen four of them.

            Our last day of diving. Roz got up early to do an early morning dive on Bari Reef. Another good dive but just the two frog-fish. Just after she got back, she got a message from Sunwise saying that they had just had a late booking for Parrotfish meaning that we would have to check out at 10. We had had the option of booking the room for an extra day as we do not fly tomorrow until 22:05 but had gambled on no-one booking the room. If no-one had booked it we would have been able to stay in it until 7pm and spend the afternoon on the balcony. We were offered a studio apartment that we could move our stuff to but this was still quite bad news.
		</p> 
		<p class="diary-text">
			After this disappointment, we had breakfast and headed down to Salt Pier for the last time. Another good dive here with Roz once again managing to find the green frog-fish. We were only able to find one turtle in the shallows but it was a good quality turtle that we could spend five to ten minutes with before exiting together
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Den Laman for kit-kats and then went down to the pier for our last dive of the trip. This was an excellent dive again. No sign of the first pair of frog-fish but Roz found both of the second pair as well as the cream coloured one. We also saw one final turtle and a big school of jacks.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After the dive we washed all our gear and took it up to the balcony to dry it. I did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had booked a table at Captain Don's for 8:30. At 6:30, we had our first drinks while watching the sunset. We had a couple more before walking to Captain Don's. We had to wait at the bar for a wile until our table was ready but we were having a few drinks this did not really matter this time. We had a final pizza and a few pina coladas and it was all quite an enjoyable night. We had a couple more drinks when we got back but I was still in bed by 11.

		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 22nd March</span>
            We were both up just before 8 and making the most of our last two hours on the balcony when we got another message from Sunwise. The people who had booked our room had missed their flight and wont be arriving until tomorrow meaning that we can stay in the room until 7pm. Very good news (for us anyway!)
		</p> 
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had breakfast then Roz went to sun-bathe for a couple of hours in Sand Dollar wile I tried without much success to get some sleep. At 11:30 we went over the road for an ice-cream at Luciano's and also to get more strepsils for the journey home.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At 2ish, we went out to Between Two Buns which was an excellent idea and by 3 we were back at Parrotfish where we could make the most of the last four hours of the balcony.
