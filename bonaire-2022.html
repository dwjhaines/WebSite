            We left Kingsclere at 1:45 and headed up to Heathrow. We no longer needed PCR tests to get into Bonaire but we do still need Lateral Flow tests. Once again, it was easier to stay at the Heathrow Ibis as this is still only £50 a night. We checked in at 14:40 and went straight out to the Collinson Covid-19 test centre which was only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There were no other customers there so we were in and out in about five minutes. We returned to the hotel for our free drink in the bar and got our negative results while we were in there.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided that tonight we would go out in Twickenham and tick off the Cask Marque pubs there. We got the bus to Feltham where we missed the train. Instead of standing around waiting for the next one, we went into the Wetherspoons for a couple of halves before getting the 17:16 train to Twickenham where we arrived about 5 minutes later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We started our pub crawl at The George which was a crap Greene King pub with no real ale at all. We did not stay! Next stop was The Three Kings which was my favourite pub of the night. It was a nice pub and had Naked Ladies so we were both quite content in there. We walked from there to The Fox which was OK but a lot more expensive than other pubs in the area. Next stop was The Barmy Arms which was nice enough but only had Greene King IPA. Again we did stop. We continued walking to The Royal Oak - Roz's favourite of the night. This again had Naked Ladies so we stayed for a couple. The final pub of the session was the Wetherspoons. I was starting to struggle a bit by this stage. My body does not seem that good at dealing with alcohol following covid and I was getting tired. We had a pint and a half each, bought sandwiches from Sainsbury's and returned to Feltham. We got the bus straight back to the hotel and returned to the room for a couple of glasses of wine while watching Middlesbrough V Spurs. I fell asleep before the end.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 2nd March</span>
            Spent a lot of today regretting last night's session. It seemed to set my covid recovery back by about a week which I really had not been expecting. I did not sleep well, my cough had got a lot worse and I was totally knackered, Ideal for a 20 - 21 hour journey to Bonaire. We were up at 6:00 had quick showers and left the hotel at about 6:30. We drove to Heathrow where we were met by someone from Giant Meet & Greet. We left the car with him, and checked in. The document checks were just about non-existent. It took a bit of time getting through security (things are getting back to normal) but we had time to buy breakfast before heading to the gate. The flight to Amsterdam left on time at about 8:45 and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later. We had an hour or so sat in seats or wandering round the airport before our traditional pre-Bonaire beer in "Taste of the Lowlands". We just had the one in here before heading to the gate for the 1:45 flight to Bonaire.

		<p class="diary-text">
			The flight left about 30 minutes late and was quite full but Roz had managed to get extra leg room seats so the journey was not as bad as it could have been. We had a couple of bottles of wine with the meal. Roz carried on and had a couple more while watching films while I tried to get as much sleep as I could. Today we were getting to Bonaire a lot later than last time. The flight was scheduled for a couple of hours later, it was late leaving and we had to stop for an hour and a half in Aruba. All not ideal in the state I was in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We landed in Bonaire just before 10. The queues for document checks here were not too bad considering the number of people arriving. Our luggage appeared a few minutes  after we had gone through immigration and we headed out of the airport. We were met outside the airport by someone from Bonaire Rent A Car and shown to the pick-up truck that we will have for the next three weeks. We put our luggage in the truck and she drove us back to the office to fill out the paperwork, pay for the truck, etc. By 10:30 we were on our way and finally arrived at Sand Dollar at about 10:45. We unpacked a few things, had something to eat and were in bed not much later.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 3rd March</span>
            We had thought of starting to dive today but given the mess I was in yesterday thought it better to have a recovery day and start tomorrow.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We could not get either of the one-bedroom apartments that we have stayed in before at Sand Dollar so were in A15 for the first time. Overall, this is probably not as nice as some of the other units we have stayed in before but is fine. It has a comfortable settee for me to sleep on and the balcony is very nice. We are only staying here nine night so it will be fine for that time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few things to do today. Every time I did anything I needed to lie down on the settee for twenty minutes or so to recover. Despite this, we did manage to get everything done. First on the list was a trip to the Chinese supermarket to buy stuff for breakfast. We returned from there and ate on the balcony. 
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz went off to lie in the sun for an hour while I recovered on the settee. At 11:00 we went to check in at the dive centre. The woman who checked us in was a lot friendlier than the one who was here last time. We filled in all our forms, payed for the diving and picked up our weight belts. All ready to go tomorrow!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At about 12:30, we went to The Warehouse to stock up on food for the next week or so. We were back at the apartment by 1:15 and had lunch on the balcony before my next sleep. At 4ish, I was able to sort out all the camera stuff ready for tomorrow. Roz went to lie in the sun again in the afternoon while I spent more time on the settee.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			That was about it for me today. We did go and look at the not too spectacular sunset but I spent the rest of the day in the apartment. We ate pasta on the balcony for tea and had an early night (very early in my case!)

            Two dives today. We were up at 7. I was still not feeling great but decided to give it a go. We had breakfast 1 and headed down to the pier to dive Bari Reef. I was quite nervous about diving in my current state but once in the water, everything was fine. The dive was pretty good and we were pleasantly surprised to see that the three frog fish that we saw here in November were all still in roughly the same place. I was also quite pleased to find that the water was not as cold as I was expecting. We had been told that the temperature was 26°c but my computer showed 27 for most of the dive and I was not as cold as I had expected to be. One thing that was noticeable was that my air consumption has got a lot worse, I assume due to the covid. We have done two hour dives here but despite not going below 12m, we had to end the dive after an hour as I was low on air. I don't think we are going to beat last year's average dive time of 93 minutes! Despite this, it was a relief that I could still dive without any problems.

		<p class="diary-text">
			After the dive, we had breakfast 2 on the balcony. Roz then went to lie in the sun while I returned to the settee. At 2:30, we headed down to Salt Pier. (Before going, Roz booked herself onto tomorrow's boat trip. I am definitely not up to three or four dives a day at the moment so she may as well do a couple of dives without me.) I was unsure about how sensible doing another dive was but again, once in the water, I was fine. Again my dive time was limited so after just over an hour I got out leaving Roz to play with the turtles. We saw two on the way out but she saw seven on the way back.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear at Port Bonaire and returned to Sand Dollar with a stop at The Warehouse on the way. By this time I was totally knackered. I was determined not to go to sleep but failed miserably and slept fairly solidly for about three hours. The planned evening meal was canceled and we had a couple of slices of toast with cheese instead. I was in bed not long after 8.

            Woke up feeling slightly better but the cough seems to have got worse. We had a course of slightly out-of-date Amoxicillin in the medical kit so I decided to start taking them. I don't think this can do any harm and hopefully it will start to clear up the cough

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz's boat was due to depart at 8:00. After breakfast, we wandered down to the pier with her gear.  The boat turned up about 15 minutes late and left 5 minutes later. This worked out to have been a good thing to do. She had two good dives at Klein Bonaire seeing seven turtles and a good octopus. It gave me a chance to relax in the apartment and catch up on things like my log book and this web site. I was also able to follow the first half of the football before heading back to the pier to meet the boat.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The boat got back at 12:30. We put her gear into the car and returned to the apartment for lunch. At 2:30 we headed for The Cliff for my firs dive of the day. Still not 100% right but a nice enough dive with one of the sea-horses from last time in  the same place and a couple of green turtles. When I got to 60 minutes, I got out leaving Roz to spend an extra 10 minutes looking for turtles in the shallows. We were back at Sand Dollar by about 4:30. Roz had considered doing a solo dive on Bari Reef but decided to put his off until tomorrow.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 6th March</span>
            As with yesterday, I woke up feeling slightly better but the Amoxicillin has not had any impact on the cough yet.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a couple of slices of toast and headed down to the pier to dive Bari Reef again. This turned into an excellent dive. I had put an extra 1lb on my weight belt. We were supposed to be at 11m to look at the frog fish but I was not concentrating on my depth and dropped to almost 16m. This proved to be quite lucky as the female frog fish was down at this depth and we probably would have missed her if I had not added the weight. We also found the male in the usual place        
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had read on ScubaBoard that there was a fourth frog fish on the reef near to where the third one is so we headed in that direction. Before we had got too far, we spotted a hawksbill turtle, the same one we had seen a couple of times at The Cliff last year. Just like last year, it did not move with any great speed and we were able to stay with it all the way back to the pier. I was on 70 minutes by this time and decided to call it a day. Roz stayed with it for another 50 minutes meaning she was with it for 90 minutes in total.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text"> 
			We returned to the apartment for breakfast and did not do too much for the rest of the morning. Roz went to lie in the sun while I stayed on the settee apart from a brief trip to the Dive Friends Retail Store to buy an octopus holder. We had lunch on the balcony again and headed off towards Salt Pier again just before 2. We had another stop at the Dive Friends shop as I had been told that there was someone there who may be able to fix my camera housing. For the last couple of days, I have not been able to turn the mode dial underwater. They seemed unsure if they could do anything but within a couple of minutes it became obvious what the problem was. A couple of days ago, there had been a few drops of water in the housing. I had not thought that much about it but the silica gel sachet had obviously got wet and expanded meaning that it no longer fits where it usually goes and was causing the camera to be too tight against the housing. Removing the sachet fixed the problem. An easy if slightly embarrassing fix!
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz sorted out tanks while I was in the shop and we were on our way South after a few minutes. As we approached Salt Pier, we could see that a ship had docked there meaning we will not be able to dive it probably until Friday or Saturday. We continued South to Margate Bay instead as it is a relatively easy entry here. We did a 60 minute dive and saw a couple of green turtles. For the first part of the dive, I felt better underwater than on any dive so far although I still struggled a bit on the way back.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We drove straight back to the Dive Friends shop at Sand Dollar where I washed my gear as I had finished diving for the day. Roz had decided to try a solo dive for the first time. We went back to the apartment and then Roz headed back to the pier at about 5:15. She had another good dive here and managed to find the fourth frog fish. The first two were no-where to be seen but she found the third one and the fourth was near-by.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After we had put her gear in the equipment room we returned to the apartment where we had planned to have take-away kebabs for tea. Roz went over to get them at 8 only to find that the shop closes at 8 on a Sunday. Will try again tomorrow. We had pasta instead and once again, I was in bed just after 9.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 7th March</span>
            Once again, I woke up feeling slightly better but with no improvement to the cough. I decided that I should not dive this morning and that I needed to see a dive doctor to check that I am fit to dive. I really should have done this before we started. I think that after having covid a fit to dive certificate is needed for our dive insurance to be valid.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast, I went over to the Bon Bida medical centre just over the road from where we are staying. After a lot of wandering around, I found the reception for MedCare and about 20 minutes later came away with a 1:30 appointment.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few things we needed to do again today. We headed off in the truck at 10. First stop was an ice-cream at Gino's. We had a quick look around the town and then returned to the car-hire office. We were not very happy with the service we had got from them. It appears that when we made the booking, they knew that the truck we wanted was unavailable despite telling us that it was. They had upgraded us to a newer vehicle which was totally unsuitable for diving from (there is no room for a tank rack in the back) and charged us an extra $84 without telling us. We had not got very far complaining by e-mail so decided to pay them a visit. Fortunately, the Dutch owner was there and was aware that they had got something wrong. He told us that we could change vehicles on Wednesday and he would continue to look into the price difference. Not too bad an outcome.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had another visit to The Warehouse to replace a few things we were out of and were back at Sand Dollar just before midday. We had lunch on the balcony before I headed back to Bon Bida for my 1:30 appointment. The doctor was pretty good and went through a whole load of tests before telling me basically that there is nothing wrong with me. He said that there was nothing wrong with my lungs and the cough was probably being caused by the lingering effects of covid, the poor air quality currently on Bonaire and the effects of breathing dry compressed air. Should clear up in a few days apparently. This is probably one of the worse coughs I have ever had and it seems unlikely that it will just clear up on its own but we will see!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back at the apartment I decided that despite being certified as being fit to dive, it would be a good idea to have a day off diving. I walked over the road to buy Strepsils but spent most of the rest of the day on the settee again.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At 4:30, Roz went off for another solo dive on Bari Reef. She managed to find yesterday's turtle a few minutes into the dive and was able to spend over an hour with it again. She also saw three of the frog fish as the turtle headed North past them all.
