            We left Kingsclere at 1:45 and headed up to Heathrow. We no longer needed PCR tests to get into Bonaire but we do still need Lateral Flow tests. Once again, it was easier to stay at the Heathrow Ibis as this is still only £50 a night. We checked in at 14:40 and went straight out to the Collinson Covid-19 test centre which was only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There were no other customers there so we were in and out in about five minutes. We returned to the hotel for our free drink in the bar and got our negative results while we were in there.

			We had decided that tonight we would go out in Twickenham and tick off the Cask Marque pubs there. We got the bus to Feltham where we missed the train. Instead of standing around waiting for the next one, we went into the Wetherspoons for a couple of halves before getting the 17:16 train to Twickenham where we arrived about 5 minutes later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We started our pub crawl at The George which was a crap Greene King pub with no real ale at all. We did not stay! Next stop was The Three Kings which was my favourite pub of the night. It was a nice pub and had Naked Ladies so we were both quite content in there. We walked from there to The Fox which was OK but a lot more expensive than other pubs in the area. Next stop was The Barmy Arms which was nice enough but only had Greene King IPA. Again we did stop. We continued walking to The Royal Oak - Roz's favourite of the night. This again had Naked Ladies so we stayed for a couple. The final pub of the session was the Wetherspoons. I was starting to struggle a bit by this stage. My body does not seem that good at dealing with alcohol following covid and I was getting tired. We had a pint and a half each, bought sandwiches from Sainsbury's and returned to Feltham. We got the bus straight back to the hotel and returned to the room for a couple of glasses of wine while watching Middlesbrough V Spurs. I fell asleep before the end.

            Spent a lot of today regretting last night's session. It seemed to set my covid recovery back by about a week which I really had not been expecting. I did not sleep well, my cough had got a lot worse and I was totally knackered, Ideal for a 20 - 21 hour journey to Bonaire. We were up at 6:00 had quick showers and left the hotel at about 6:30. We drove to Heathrow where we were met by someone from Giant Meet & Greet. We left the car with him, and checked in. The document checks were just about non-existent. It took a bit of time getting through security (things are getting back to normal) but we had time to buy breakfast before heading to the gate. The flight to Amsterdam left on time at about 8:45 and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later. We had an hour or so sat in seats or wandering round the airport before our traditional pre-Bonaire beer in "Taste of the Lowlands". We just had the one in here before heading to the gate for the 1:45 flight to Bonaire.

			The flight left about 30 minutes late and was quite full but Roz had managed to get extra leg room seats so the journey was not as bad as it could have been. We had a couple of bottles of wine with the meal. Roz carried on and had a couple more while watching films while I tried to get as much sleep as I could. Today we were getting to Bonaire a lot later than last time. The flight was scheduled for a couple of hours later, it was late leaving and we had to stop for an hour and a half in Aruba. All not ideal in the state I was in.
        </p>

			We landed in Bonaire just before 10. The queues for document checks here were not too bad considering the number of people arriving. Our luggage appeared a few minutes  after we had gone through immigration and we headed out of the airport. We were met outside the airport by someone from Bonaire Rent A Car and shown to the pick-up truck that we will have for the next three weeks. We put our luggage in the truck and she drove us back to the office to fill out the paperwork, pay for the truck, etc. By 10:30 we were on our way and finally arrived at Sand Dollar at about 10:45. We unpacked a few things, had something to eat and were in bed not much later.

            We had thought of starting to dive today but given the mess I was in yesterday thought it better to have a recovery day and start tomorrow.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We could not get either of the one-bedroom apartments that we have stayed in before at Sand Dollar so were in A15 for the first time. Overall, this is probably not as nice as some of the other units we have stayed in before but is fine. It has a comfortable settee for me to sleep on and the balcony is very nice. We are only staying here nine night so it will be fine for that time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few things to do today. Every time I did anything I needed to lie down on the settee for twenty minutes or so to recover. Despite this, we did manage to get everything done. First on the list was a trip to the Chinese supermarket to buy stuff for breakfast. We returned from there and ate on the balcony.

			Roz went off to lie in the sun for an hour while I recovered on the settee. At 11:00 we went to check in at the dive centre. The woman who checked us in was a lot friendlier than the one who was here last time. We filled in all our forms, payed for the diving and picked up our weight belts. All ready to go tomorrow!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At about 12:30, we went to The Warehouse to stock up on food for the next week or so. We were back at the apartment by 1:15 and had lunch on the balcony before my next sleep. At 4ish, I was able to sort out all the camera stuff ready for tomorrow. Roz went to lie in the sun again in the afternoon while I spent more time on the settee.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			That was about it for me today. We did go and look at the not too spectacular sunset but I spent the rest of the day in the apartment. We ate pasta on the balcony for tea and had an early night (very early in my case!)

            Two dives today. We were up at 7. I was still not feeling great but decided to give it a go. We had breakfast 1 and headed down to the pier to dive Bari Reef. I was quite nervous about diving in my current state but once in the water, everything was fine. The dive was pretty good and we were pleasantly surprised to see that the three frog fish that we saw here in November were all still in roughly the same place. I was also quite pleased to find that the water was not as cold as I was expecting. We had been told that the temperature was 26°c but my computer showed 27 for most of the dive and I was not as cold as I had expected to be. One thing that was noticeable was that my air consumption has got a lot worse, I assume due to the covid. We have done two hour dives here but despite not going below 12m, we had to end the dive after an hour as I was low on air. I don't think we are going to beat last year's average dive time of 93 minutes! Despite this, it was a relief that I could still dive without any problems.

			After the dive, we had breakfast 2 on the balcony. Roz then went to lie in the sun while I returned to the settee. At 2:30, we headed down to Salt Pier. (Before going, Roz booked herself onto tomorrow's boat trip. I am definitely not up to three or four dives a day at the moment so she may as well do I couple of dives without me.) I was unsure about how sensible doing another dive was but again, once in the water, I was fine. Again my dive time was limited so after just over and hour I got out leaving Roz to play with the turtles. We saw two on the way out but she saw seven on the way back.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear at Port Bonaire and returned to Sand Dollar with a stop at The Warehouse on the way. By this time I was totally knackered. I was determined not to go to sleep but failed miserably and slept fairly solidly for about three hours. The planned evening meal was canceled and we had a couple of slices of toast with cheese instead. I was in bed not long after 8.
