          We were awake by 6 and left Kingsclere just after 6:30. We got to the Heathrow Terminal 3 car park by about 7:45 and had a wait of about 10 minutes before someone from the Meet and Greet turned up to take the car. Getting through security was relatively quick. We had breakfast in the departure area before heading to the gate. The flight was full but took off just after the scheduled departure time of 9:55.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We landed in Budapest at about 1:30 and then spent almost half an hour queuing to get our passports stamped. Once through immigration, everything was pretty quick. We took money out, bought our bus tickets and boarded the bus to the centre. We got the bus to Kálvin tér and then the metro to Budapest-Kelenföld train station. We had almost an hour to wait for our train to Pécs. We went outside the station to look for somewhere to eat but ended up going for our first beer of the trip instead. We had our drinks sat outside a bar then bought food from the bakery next door. We bought a few cans for the journey and then got on the 16:12 train which left on time.

          We arrived in Pécs at about 6:45 and had a ten minute walk to Hotel Central where we had a room booked for the night. After negotiating a series of number pad things, we got our key and let ourselves into our room. We dropped off our bags and went straight out for the evening.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another walk of about ten minutes to get into the centre. After a quick look around, we got a table outside Bazár, a craft beer bar on the main square. We had a beer with excellent burgers outside before moving inside for another drink when it got colder. We left there after a couple, had one more drink at "Fryer" and then a few more at Beertok, another craft beer place opposite our hotel. We stayed in there until just before midnight. 
        </p>

          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 26th April</span>
          We were up by 9ish, had showers and went down for breakfast. We went for a quick walk to the shopping centre near the hotel, returned to the room to get our bags and walked back to the station to get the 11:03 train to Villány. It took about 45 minutes to get to Villány and then about 20 minutes to walk to the hotel/spa we had stayed at in 2018. We had booked the same package we had last time so had a wine tasting session, wine bath, etc all included again. Our room was ready when we arrived so we were able to check in straight away. We arranged to have our welcome drinks bought to the room at 3:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After unpacking, we went straight down to the pool/spa area. It was just about warm enough to sit in the sun outside for half an hour or so but we spent most of the time in the hot pools or the sauna (the steam room was not working and none of the staff seemed to know how to sort it out). 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text">
          We started on the wine at 3:30. There was a bit of confusion about our welcome drinks which we thought were being delivered to the room but after walking to the bar, we were given a bottle of sparkling white wine. We took this back to the room and had a glass or two each while I opened my birthday cards and presents. At 4, we had an hour and a half of wine tasting. The last time we were here, this was at the Gere winery but this time we were in the hotel's bar. Still all very enjoyable.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another glass back in the room and then went out and had a bottle of white wine in one of the wine cellars (or pincék) just up the road. We were back in the hotel for our meal at 7. The meal was included in our package and was a seven course tasting menu. As with last time, the food was excellent as was the accompanying wine.

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 27th April</span>
          A lazy day without too much to do. We were up by 9ish and had breakfast in the hotel. Apart from a bit of a walk around the village, we did not do a lot all day apart from lazing around either by the pool, in the steam room (which had been repaired), in the sauna or in the room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At 4:00 we had the last part of our package, our wine baths. These were very pleasant again and we were able to spend half an hour in there with our glasses of wine. As with our last visit here, there is hardly any other guests using the spa which does make it all a lot nicer. 
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We went back to the room for showers and then went out again for the evening. We went back to the same pincé we were in last night and had a bottle of wine sat outside. We had a second bottle in another pincé before going to eat at the restaurant next door to our hotel (Halasi Pince). We had eaten here when we visited in 2018. We were sat outside then but this time were in the cellar type restaurant downstairs. It was a spectacular setting and another very good meal. We got through another couple of bottles with our meal and then returned to the hotel for our "welcome drink" which we only vaguely remember!

          Again, we did not do a lot between having breakfast and checking out of the hotel at 11:30. After checking out, we walked back to the station and began our journey towards Szentendre where we will stay for the next two nights. We had to return to Budapest via the same route that we used to come down to Villány. First we got the 12:22 train back to Pécs. When we got to Pécs, we had a 10 minute wait for the 13:19 train back to Budapest. The train left a few minutes late at and was about half an hour late by the time we got into Budapest Keleti at 16:30.

          We walked through the station and out to the metro station. After managing to buy tickets (not as straightforward as it could have been) we got the metro to Batthyány tér and then got straight onto a suburban train to Szentendre. We arrived in Szentendre at about 17:30. It was a 15 minute walk from the station to our apartment where we had to let ourselves in again. We dropped off our stuff and went straight out to a supermarket to buy wine and something to eat as we had not had lunch and were getting hungry. We had showers followed by a couple of glasses of wine before going out again.

          Szentendre is not a big town but has a very scenic old town centre which is about 5 minutes walk from where we are staying. We wandered down to Fő tér, the main square in the centre and after a few photos headed to Teddy Beer, a craft beer bar that I had read about before leaving home. This was an excellent place to drink. Apart from the fact that there were a lot of bears in the bar, there was a very good range of Hungarian and foreign (mainly Belgian) beers. We tried a few of the beers between us and had a tapas sharing platter to eat. It would have been easy to stay for longer but we were relatively sensible and left to go back to the apartment by 10ish.

          We were up just after 8 and walked to the supermarket to buy food for breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We went out to see the sights of Szentendre at 10:30. There was not too much in the way of spectacular sights but it was a nice enough walk. We went to see a small locals market on the edge of the town and then walked back into the centre. Here there was a more touristy market and plenty of souvenir shops, etc. We walked up to the old Serbian cathedral and from there on to Castle Hill for the views and that just about completed our sight-seeing.

          We have not done much walking in the last couple of days so we walked down through the centre and down to the Danube. From here we walked North along the river for a couple of miles before turning round and heading back again. The weather had been cold and grey when we set off but the sun was just about coming through by the time we walked back and it was all quite enjoyable. We had lunch in the apartment when we got back just after 2pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We both watched our respective football matches on our phones at 4. With both teams failing to win! Swansea's season is effectively over and Sunderland look as if they have blown their chances of getting into the play-offs. We started drinking again not long after the games had finished! We had bought a couple of cans of beer on our way back from our walk so we started with those. We had a couple of glasses of wine as well and then went out for the evening.

          We had another look around the square before spending the rest of the evening in Teddy Beer again. We returned to the apartment to join the J-Team video call while getting through another bottle of wine and got to bed sometime around midnight.

          We left the apartment at 10:20 and walked down to the river stopping at our local supermarket to buy breakfast on the way. We ate breakfast on a bench looking at the river and then walked back to the train station. We managed to buy tickets and get straight onto a train that left at 11:14. We arrived back at Batthyány tér just before midday.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Batthyány tér station is right on The Danube as is the apartment that we have booked, which is about a mile further South. We walked out of the station and had our first view of the parliament buildings which were just the other side of the river. We walked along the river to the apartment which is just North of Elizabeth Bridge. Roz had been told on the way down that the apartment was ready so we were able to go straight in when we arrived. The apartment had been recommended to us by Aleks and Andi and was excellent. Plenty of space again and very good views of The Danube.

          The weather was quite nice when we arrived but predicted to deteriorate during the afternoon so we went straight out to start our sight-seeing. The Pope has been in Budapest for the last three days and we did not know how much of an impact this would have on being able to get around the city but it did not have any noticeable effect. We walked over Elizabeth Bridge and on to St. Stephen's Basilica (or Szent István Bazilika) where we were able to go and look around inside. From there we headed South and walked the length of Váci utca. This is basically just a pedestrianised shopping street but was reasonably pleasant to wander down. We stopped for lunch (kebabs) when we had got to the cheaper end of the street and then went to have a look at a couple of bars that we are planning on visiting at some point. We walked back over Szabadság Bridge and returned to the apartment.
