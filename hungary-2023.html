          We were awake by 6 and left Kingsclere just after 6:30. We got to the Heathrow Terminal 3 car park by about 7:45 and had a wait of about 10 minutes before someone from the Meet and Greet turned up to take the car. Getting through security was relatively quick. We had breakfast in the departure area before heading to the gate. The flight was full but took off just after the scheduled departure time of 9:55.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We landed in Budapest at about 1:30 and then spent almost half an hour queuing to get our passports stamped. Once through immigration, everything was pretty quick. We took money out, bought our bus tickets and boarded the bus to the centre. We got the bus to Kálvin tér and then the metro to Budapest-Kelenföld train station. We had almost an hour to wait for our train to Pécs. We went outside the station to look for somewhere to eat but ended up going for our first beer of the trip instead. We had our drinks sat outside a bar then bought food from the bakery next door. We bought a few cans for the journey and then got on the 16:12 train which left on time.

          We arrived in Pécs at about 6:45 and had a ten minute walk to Hotel Central where we had a room booked for the night. After negotiating a series of number pad things, we got our key and let ourselves into our room. We dropped off our bags and went straight out for the evening.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another walk of about ten minutes to get into the centre. After a quick look around, we got a table outside Bazár, a craft beer bar on the main square. We had a beer with excellent burgers outside before moving inside for another drink when it got colder. We left there after a couple, had one more drink at "Fryer" and then a few more at Beertok, another craft beer place opposite our hotel. We stayed in there until just before midnight.

          We were up by 9ish, had showers and went down for breakfast. We went for a quick walk to the shopping centre near the hotel, returned to the room to get our bags and walked back to the station to get the 11:03 train to Villány. It took about 45 minutes to get to Villány and then about 20 minutes to walk to the hotel/spa we had stayed at in 2018. We had booked the same package we had last time so had a wine tasting session, wine bath, etc all included again. Our room was ready when we arrived so we were able to check in straight away. We arranged to have our welcome drinks bought to the room at 3:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After unpacking, we went straight down to the pool/spa area. It was just about warm enough to sit in the sun outside for half an hour or so but we spent most of the time in the hot pools or the sauna (the steam room was not working and none of the staff seemed to know how to sort it out). 
        </p>

          We started on the wine at 3:30. There was a bit of confusion about our welcome drinks which we thought were being delivered to the room but after walking to the bar, we were given a bottle of sparkling white wine. We took this back to the room and had a glass or two each while I opened my birthday cards and presents. At 4, we had an hour and a half of wine tasting. The last time we were here, this was at the Gere winery but this time we were in the hotel's bar. Still all very enjoyable.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another glass back in the room and then went out and had a bottle of white wine in one of the wine cellars (or pincék) just up the road. We were back in the hotel for our meal at 7. The meal was included in our package and was a seven course tasting menu. As with last time, the food was excellent as was the accompanying wine.
