            Left Pantyffynon at 9:15 to meet the 10:05 train from Swansea to Paddington. Dave got on the train at Newport and we drank the litre bottle of wine that I had with my packed lunch. regan had eaten most of his packed lunch before Port Talbot.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We went by tube to Putney Bridge where Ray met us in his car. We went to The Bricklayers Arms and had a couple of pints. We then went to Ray's house before going back into central London. We killed time all afternoon until pub opening time. We had two pints in pub opposite Charring Cross Station before leaving on the 6:55 to Dover. We found a purse on the train which we handed over to police in Dover. We enclosed a note in the purse hoping that the female student to whom it belonged would write back. We had a pint in two different pubs in Dover town centre before going by bus to Eastern Docks. Arrived at the waiting room at 11:50. Everyone complaining of sore shoulders and being generally knackered. Regan broke his rucksack in one of the pubs.

            After a boring two hour wait at Dover, we finally left for Ostende at 1:00 am. the crossing took four hours most of which was spent trying to sleep in the baggage room. Got to Ostende at 6:00 and caught a connection to Brussels. The town didn't seem that exciting when we first walked round at 8 in the morning, but after we had left our rucksacks at the station and had our first pints of Stella things started to get better.

            We spent the whole day drinking and eating. I had bread rolls for breakfast, French loaf for lunch and a round loaf for tea. I am sick of bloody bread already. Altogether we had about 12 pints each (the weakest of which was Stella) in about eight different pubs. By the end of the day we were all quite pissed and finding our luggage and getting across Brussels to a different station caused a lot of confusion. No-one really knows how but at 22:22, we got on the train to Munich, found a compartment with couchettes and fell asleep instantly. Spent approx £10.

            Woke at 4:00 with a hangover. Didn't get back to sleep again until 5:30. By the time we got to Munich, my hangover had gone but both Dave and regan had woken with worse hangovers. We had a cup of tea near the station and then went back to the station to stuff our rucksacks into lockers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked round Munich for most of the morning. Dave threw up in a bin and shortly afterwards we met Keith Hubber in Munich's red light district. We had lunch in McDonalds - Big Mac and chips, same as in England.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We spent the afternoon sight-seeing, churches, fountains, etc. We went by tube to The Olympic Stadium. It was pretty impressive. Me and Dave went paddling in an Olympic size duck pond nearby. Me and Dave went back into Munich for nothing because we didn't buy tickets. Regan paid about 50p.

            By the early evening, everyones hangovers had gone and we started drinking again. We found a cheapish pub which did really good value food (chicken schnitzel and chips and two pints). Went from there to a grotty pub and then to a red light district bar. We only had a half but it was quite an eventful stop. Went then to a really good cheap pub. We bought our pints and then went to sit in the middle of a square type place surrounded by trees. Finished our pints then legged it back to the station (because it was raining), nicked the locker keys and boarded the train to Verona (Brenner Express). The train left Munich at 11:58.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday August 9th</span>
            We shared a compartment with an Irish girl who was also going to Corfu. I got about four hours sleep, being woken every half an hour or so by customs or guards, etc. We woke at 6:30 which was worrying as we were supposed to change trains at 6:00. By complete coincidence we had woken up in Verona where we were supposed to change and the train was half an hour late. We had to leg it off the train carrying our shoes and socks, etc and got on to the train to Venice (one and a half hours). We spent abot two hours at Venice station, first of all washing and shaving, then queuing to leave our rucksacks. We then spent the rest of the morning sight-seeing which would have been OK if it hadn't been pissing down with rain. We had pizzas for lunch but no lager (£2 a pint). We saw St Mark's Square, Rialto Bridge, etc then seemed what seemed like hours getting back to the station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            All the streets looked the same and the signposts appeared to be sending us round in circles. We bought bottles of wine on the way (6 at about 75p each). We got back to the station at about 1, soaking wet and collecting our rucksacks, then after a lot of confusion, got on a train to Belgrade. We boarded the train at about 2, three hours before it pulled out at 4:55.

            We played cards and drank wine until Trieste where me and Dave got off while the train waited at the station for an hour. We went and bought more wine (4 litres for £4) and I also managed to nick a Daily Mirror. We went back to the train and then proceeded to get pissed out of our minds. I fell asleep on the floor of our compartment at about 2 o'clock. I don't remember a lot about the train journey.

        <p class="diary-text">
            So far we are all really enjoying the holiday and having a great time. I only hope the weather improves. I have just discovered that I threw up out of the train window last night. (We decided to leave Venice a day early due to it being expensive and also to the heavy rain. At this point, we are a day ahead of schedule)

            A relatively quiet day after the heavy drinking of last night. Arrived in Belgrade at 11am, two hours late. This meant that we had spent 21 hours sat on the same train. We got rid of our rucksacks and then headed for the town centre to look for food. We found that everywhere was really cheap. We had pizzas for 60p each and a pint for 30p. We then walked through town went sight-seeing round a park with a castle in it, finally ending up in a bar/restaurant overlooking The Danube. We had meat on sticks which was served on a large piece of veal with pieces of liver and chilies. I only tried a tiny piece of chili but it was probably the hottest thing I have ever tasted. It took about half an hour for my mouth to recover.

            After this we returned to the town and went for a pint. We were all sitting outside a bar when we realised we had to collect our rucksacks form left luggage within 40 minutes. We then got totally lost running around in circles and not apparently getting any nearer to the station. Eventually we made it with about a minute to spare. After a quick wash, we went out of the station, found a restaurant/cafe and had chicken and chips (90p). We then bought food and drinks for the next train journey and went to another bar. After this shut at 10:00, we went to the station to wait for the 11:58 train to Athens. It arrived an hour late and was probably the worst train so far. Packed as usual, me and Dave had to sleep on the corridor floor. We got to sleep by about 2. Today we had consumed seven pints each and one litre of wine between us.

            We woke up at about 6 and went back to sit in a compartment filled with Yugoslavian blokes. The carriage we were in wasn't going all the way to Athens so we ahd to change coaches at Skopje. The only seats we could find were in a compartment occupied by three Swedish girls who were also going round with Inter Rail. Had quite an enjoyable journey from there drinking our two litres of wine, eating crisps & biscuits, playing cards and having pairs of tits flashed at us every five minutes. I wasn't concentrating much on the cards. When we eventually arrived in Thesolonika, we went and booked into a hotel (Hotel Vagina) which was quite impressive. We all had our first bath for a week then went out to sample local food and drink.

            At 11, we came back to the hotel bar where we et two English blokes and talked to them until about 2:30. Got to bed by about 3 and fell asleep instantly. Today we had consumed eight pints each plus two litres of wine between us. So far we have had 37 pints each  plus 12½ litres of wine between us. Not bad for six days. Regan had a delayed hangover from the last three days. He threw up on the train and then bottled out of drinking the wine on the train.

            Woke up at 10 and had a bath. Dave and Regan woke at about 11 and we left the hotel by 12:30. Regan's rush t-shirt had fallen off the balcony during the night! The night had cost us DR800 which was pretty good value. We ahd lunch at a cafe/bar (spaghetti and beef which didn't really go together as they arrived on seperate plates).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Spent the day sight-seeing, drinking and buying presents. Thesalonika was quite a nice place and very cheap. We had a cheap Wimpey type meal in the evening and then walked out to the zoo type thing with bears and monkeys and birds. We went back to a bar opposite the station. We asked for an ouzo but the manager insisted we tried something stronger and he gave us a free glass. It was pretty strong and we paid for another. We left there at 10:45 and went to wait for our train. It was due in at 11 but didn't arrive until 2. Spent three hours drinking Ouzo, playing cards and stuffing down biscuits. We met two Danish girls at the station. We went to sit with them after they had been given hassle by pissed Greek blokes. They stayed with us all the way to Athens.

            On the train, we finished off the third bottle of Ouzo and bought cans of lager which we drank until 6:30. Fell asleep then for three hours. Todays total - 6 pints, 2 Tsipouro and 1 bottle of ouzo.

            Arrived in Athens at baout midday. On the train as we were entering Athens, blokes were walking round handing out leaflets advertising youth hostel type places. We chose one called Hotel Joy and went to book in. We got a room for three for about DR600 each (approx £4.50) and left our stuff there. It was not as nice as our last room but it was still a lot better than sleeping on trains. The toilet was out of order. We left the hotel at about 1:30 and went to find the Acropolis. We had moussaka on the way which was a bit tasteless but quite nice. The Acropolis was quite impressive. There is an excellent view of Athens from it.

            We went back to the hotel and wrote postcards and had a bath. We went down to the bar for the evening and had a couple of drinks before going out and buying food (takeaway pizza and chips). We went back to the bar for a pint and then went to a bar next door to a local disco.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We sat there for half an hour to see if anyone was going in. No-one was so we went back to the hotel bar. We argued all night about politics which was pretty pointless as no-one really knew what they were talking about. At about 1:15 we went back to our room for another pint and then went out to the disco. There was still hardly any people there so we went back to the bar next door. we had a pint and me and Dave played backgammon until about 2:30. We went back to the hotel by 3 and then went sight-seeing in the mixed shower unit. Quite impressive scenery in there too! Went to bed and straight to sleep at 3:30. Today we only had eight pints each.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday August 14th</span>
            I woke up before the others and had a bath, the fourth in four days. Dave was next up and he did likewise. While we were waiting for Regan to get ready, Dave and I went out to buy something we could all eat for lunch. After walking round various supermarkets, we eventually decided to buy a 13lb water melon which we took back to the hotel. At 11:30 we checked out and went into the town centre to send postcards home. Regan thought he had lost his camera but he had left it at the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We had to catch the 1pm train from Athens to Patras but when we arrived at the station we discovered it was fully booked. We left our rucksacks chained together at the station and walked to a park where we sat down and ate the water melon.

            We then went to The National Art Museum. I got in cheap using Dave's 1983 I.S.I.C. card but I got thrown out for having a camera without a camera ticket. While I was waiting for Dave and Regan to come out I saw the two Danish girls we met on the train. They are going to Corfu tomorrow. We eventually left Athens on the 3:45 train which was the worst train we have so far been on. Me and Dave had to sit on the floor by the toilet. Regan had a seat at the other end of the train. We arrived in Patras at 9 and went to buy tickets for the ferry. our ticket cost DR3150. We got on a boat at 9:20 and it left at about 10. We sat around drinking (5 pints) and eating until about 2 and then went to sleep in our sleeping bags on the deck.

            We arrived in Corfu at 9:00 and caught a bus to a campsite near Vatos on the West side of the island. It was quite crowded but we managed to find an almost flat spot to pitch our tents. The campsite was quite good. It had toilets, washing facilities and outdoor showers. There was also a supermarket, restaurant and bar there. After we had pitched our tents, we went to find the beach. We had been told that there were two beaches, one within walking distance and one you could only reach by bus. We got lost and ended up walking to the latter about three miles away. The beach was excellent. The sand was too hot to walk on  but the sea was cold and very refreshing. We stayed at the beach for about an hour and a half before going to an adjoining hotel to use their swimming pool and showers. We then went back to the campsite by bus. We had moussaka and a pint. In the afternoon we went to look for the nearer of the two beaches. We got lost again and found a third beach which was not as good. Dave and I had a short swim and then went back to the tent.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went to the campsite restaurant for tea (omelet and chips). After tea, we went to the campsite bar, where they were doing stupid Greek dances, before trying out the local discos. We went to The Country Club first which was quite good. We were talking to and dancing with two German girls. Regan threw up in the bog after seeing a turd. We then went to the Pam Pam Disco where we only stayed about 15 minutes due to the bar being closed. We then went back to The Country Club where we had our last (7th) pint. We then returned to the campsite at about 1:30. Me and Dave took the flysheet off our tent, laid our sleeping bags on it and went to sleep. Regan slept in his tent at the top of the slope and kept sliding down all night.

            Dave and I woke at 7:30 and we decided to go into Corfu Town. We left Regan still fast asleep in his tent. We went into town to look at moped prices and to buy food. We also went to the ferry terminal to see if we could find the two Danish girls that we had met in Thesalonika. We couldn't find them but they may not be coming in today. We had got into town on the bus for nothing as the conductor had not seen us. We walked around the town and bought a water melon and a loaf of bread before returning to the campsite by bus.

            We ate most of the water  melon outside the tents. We all went to the beach and found the one "within walking distance". The Greeks seem to have problems calculating distances. The beach was about two miles away along a dusty hilly track. Half of the beach was mostly filled with nudists. We sat halfway between the two beaches. We swam and sunbathed for about two and a half hours. I think I overdid the sunbathing as my back is a bit hot now. We walked back to the tent and had our second meal of the day - a third of a loaf of bread with a slice of ham and cheese. After a shower, we went to the bar and met a boring English bloke who we left after about 15 minutes. We then went to a taverna and had chips and a pint. We then went back to the tent buying 1½ litres of wine on the way. We left the wine in the tent and went back to the bar where we met two Canadian blokes, also doing Inter Rail. We went with them to the two discos which were both empty. We didn't stay long before returning to the tent to knock back the wine. Went to sleep again outside the tent at about 2:30.

            Woke at 7:30 and me and Dave went into town again. Still no sign of the Danish girls. We bought loafs of bread for lunch and tea. We had got into town free again but w paid DR40 to return to the campsite. We bought ham and cheese at the camp supermarket and ate one of the loafs of bread for lunch. Regan discovered that he had left his torch on all night and the batteries were flat. After lunch, we caught a bus to Glyfada Beach with the two Canadians. We spent about two hours swimming and sun-bathing and then went to the hotel swimming pool. At about 5, we hitched back to the campsite. We had two lifts and got back in about five minutes.

            We ahd tea when we got back, ham and cheese rolls again. After showering we made our way to the bar for the second time today(one pint at lunchtime). We were joined halfway through the evening and all of us proceeded to get smashed out of our minds. We got through approximately 12 pints each though we are not really sure. Me and Dave combined to drop one full bottle on the floor, soaking my camera in the process. We kept all the bottles on the table which looked quite impressive by the end of the evening. We were talking to some English blokes at the end of the evening but were not really sure who. We were also talking to some Dutch girls who were being chatted up by some Greeks. As Dave said this morning, we know about half the people on teh campsite but are not really sire which half. I don't really remember leaving the bar but apparently we drank half a bottle of wine before we crashed out.

            We have now had 81 pints each and 15½ litres of wine between us. We are rapidly running out of money which is not really surprising.

            We regained consciousness at about 11. Regan had fallen asleep with his personal cassette on and the batteries were flat. We bought lunch at about 12, ham and cheese rolls. We just lazed around by the tent till about 2 and then went to the beach with the long name beginning with M. We met the Canadians there. They had built a sand-castle. We lay on the beach until about 5 and then walked back. The weather was not so hot today so we were able to stay longer without burning. Regan buit a dick out of sand while we were on the beach.

            We had ham, cheese and bread  for tea (our fifth consecutive meal of ham, cheese and bread). After showering, etc we went to the bar for a pint and then we went with a bunch of German and Dutch blokes to a taverna near the village of Vatos. The taverna was called Spiros and it was pretty full. We had spaghetti because it was pretty cheap, it would have been quite nice if it was warm. After a couple of pints, the German bloke who we were with bought a round of Metaxas. For DR20 you got a double measure of a drink about the strength of Ouzo. We had another four of these and then went to The Country Club with a lot of people including the Canadians (Peter and Shaun) and two English girls.

            When we got to The Country Club they were giving out free punch which had nearly run out. I had two glasses and then about a pint of lager. We were relatively sober except for Hans, the German bloke, and Regan. We danced, mainly with the two English girls until about 3am and then went back to the tent to crash out. I have got heat bumps all over me.
