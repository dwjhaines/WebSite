            Regan and I left Pantyffynon at 9:15 to meet the 10:05 train from Swansea to Paddington. Dave got on the train at Newport and we drank the litre bottle of wine that I had with my packed lunch. Regan had eaten most of his packed lunch before Port Talbot.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We went by tube to Putney Bridge where Ray met us in his car. We went to The Bricklayers Arms and had a couple of pints. We then went to Ray's house before going back into central London. We killed time all afternoon until pub opening time. We had two pints in pub opposite Charring Cross Station before leaving on the 6:55 to Dover. We found a purse on the train which we handed over to police in Dover. We enclosed a note in the purse hoping that the female student to whom it belonged would write back. We had a pint in two different pubs in Dover town centre before going by bus to Eastern Docks. Arrived at the waiting room at 11:50. Everyone complaining of sore shoulders and being generally knackered. Regan broke his rucksack in one of the pubs.

            After a boring two hour wait at Dover, we finally left for Ostende at 1:00 am. the crossing took four hours most of which was spent trying to sleep in the baggage room. Got to Ostende at 6:00 and caught a connection to Brussels. The town didn't seem that exciting when we first walked round at 8 in the morning, but after we had left our rucksacks at the station and had our first pints of Stella things started to get better.

            We spent the whole day drinking and eating. I had bread rolls for breakfast, French loaf for lunch and a round loaf for tea. I am sick of bloody bread already. Altogether we had about 12 pints each (the weakest of which was Stella) in about eight different pubs. By the end of the day we were all quite pissed and finding our luggage and getting across Brussels to a different station caused a lot of confusion. No-one really knows how but at 22:22, we got on the train to Munich, found a compartment with couchettes and fell asleep instantly. Spent approx £10.

            Woke at 4:00 with a hangover. Didn't get back to sleep again until 5:30. By the time we got to Munich, my hangover had gone but both Dave and regan had woken with worse hangovers. We had a cup of tea near the station and then went back to the station to stuff our rucksacks into lockers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked round Munich for most of the morning. Dave threw up in a bin and shortly afterwards we met Keith Hubber in Munich's red light district. We had lunch in McDonalds - Big Mac and chips, same as in England.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We spent the afternoon sight-seeing, churches, fountains, etc. We went by tube to The Olympic Stadium. It was pretty impressive. Me and Dave went paddling in an Olympic size duck pond nearby. Me and Dave went back into Munich for nothing because we didn't buy tickets. Regan paid about 50p.

            By the early evening, everyones hangovers had gone and we started drinking again. We found a cheapish pub which did really good value food (chicken schnitzel and chips and two pints). Went from there to a grotty pub and then to a red light district bar. We only had a half but it was quite an eventful stop. Went then to a really good cheap pub. We bought our pints and then went to sit in the middle of a square type place surrounded by trees. Finished our pints then legged it back to the station (because it was raining), nicked the locker keys and boarded the train to Verona (Brenner Express). The train left Munich at 11:58.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday August 9th</span>
            We shared a compartment with an Irish girl who was also going to Corfu. I got about four hours sleep, being woken every half an hour or so by customs or guards, etc. We woke at 6:30 which was worrying as we were supposed to change trains at 6:00. By complete coincidence we had woken up in Verona where we were supposed to change and the train was half an hour late. We had to leg it off the train carrying our shoes and socks, etc and got on to the train to Venice (one and a half hours). We spent abot two hours at Venice station, first of all washing and shaving, then queuing to leave our rucksacks. We then spent the rest of the morning sight-seeing which would have been OK if it hadn't been pissing down with rain. We had pizzas for lunch but no lager (£2 a pint). We saw St Mark's Square, Rialto Bridge, etc then seemed what seemed like hours getting back to the station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            All the streets looked the same and the signposts appeared to be sending us round in circles. We bought bottles of wine on the way (6 at about 75p each). We got back to the station at about 1, soaking wet and collecting our rucksacks, then after a lot of confusion, got on a train to Belgrade. We boarded the train at about 2, three hours before it pulled out at 4:55.

            We played cards and drank wine until Trieste where me and Dave got off while the train waited at the station for an hour. We went and bought more wine (4 litres for £4) and I also managed to nick a Daily Mirror. We went back to the train and then proceeded to get pissed out of our minds. I fell asleep on the floor of our compartment at about 2 o'clock. I don't remember a lot about the train journey.

        <p class="diary-text">
            So far we are all really enjoying the holiday and having a great time. I only hope the weather improves. I have just discovered that I threw up out of the train window last night. (We decided to leave Venice a day early due to it being expensive and also to the heavy rain. At this point, we are a day ahead of schedule)

            A relatively quiet day after the heavy drinking of last night. Arrived in Belgrade at 11am, two hours late. This meant that we had spent 21 hours sat on the same train. We got rid of our rucksacks and then headed for the town centre to look for food. We found that everywhere was really cheap. We had pizzas for 60p each and a pint for 30p. We then walked through town went sight-seeing round a park with a castle in it, finally ending up in a bar/restaurant overlooking The Danube. We had meat on sticks which was served on a large piece of veal with pieces of liver and chilies. I only tried a tiny piece of chili but it was probably the hottest thing I have ever tasted. It took about half an hour for my mouth to recover.

            After this we returned to the town and went for a pint. We were all sitting outside a bar when we realised we had to collect our rucksacks form left luggage within 40 minutes. We then got totally lost running around in circles and not apparently getting any nearer to the station. Eventually we made it with about a minute to spare. After a quick wash, we went out of the station, found a restaurant/cafe and had chicken and chips (90p). We then bought food and drinks for the next train journey and went to another bar. After this shut at 10:00, we went to the station to wait for the 11:58 train to Athens. It arrived an hour late and was probably the worst train so far. Packed as usual, me and Dave had to sleep on the corridor floor. We got to sleep by about 2. Today we had consumed seven pints each and one litre of wine between us.

            We woke up at about 6 and went back to sit in a compartment filled with Yugoslavian blokes. The carriage we were in wasn't going all the way to Athens so we ahd to change coaches at Skopje. The only seats we could find were in a compartment occupied by three Swedish girls who were also going round with Inter Rail. Had quite an enjoyable journey from there drinking our two litres of wine, eating crisps & biscuits, playing cards and having pairs of tits flashed at us every five minutes. I wasn't concentrating much on the cards. When we eventually arrived in Thesolonika, we went and booked into a hotel (Hotel Vagina) which was quite impressive. We all had our first bath for a week then went out to sample local food and drink.

            At 11, we came back to the hotel bar where we met two English blokes and talked to them until about 2:30. Got to bed by about 3 and fell asleep instantly. Today we had consumed eight pints each plus two litres of wine between us. So far we have had 37 pints each  plus 12½ litres of wine between us. Not bad for six days. Regan had a delayed hangover from the last three days. He threw up on the train and then bottled out of drinking the wine on the train.

            Woke up at 10 and had a bath. Dave and Regan woke at about 11 and we left the hotel by 12:30. Regan's rush t-shirt had fallen off the balcony during the night! The night had cost us DR800 which was pretty good value. We ahd lunch at a cafe/bar (spaghetti and beef which didn't really go together as they arrived on seperate plates).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Spent the day sight-seeing, drinking and buying presents. Thesalonika was quite a nice place and very cheap. We had a cheap Wimpey type meal in the evening and then walked out to the zoo type thing with bears and monkeys and birds. We went back to a bar opposite the station. We asked for an ouzo but the manager insisted we tried something stronger and he gave us a free glass. It was pretty strong and we paid for another. We left there at 10:45 and went to wait for our train. It was due in at 11 but didn't arrive until 2. Spent three hours drinking Ouzo, playing cards and stuffing down biscuits. We met two Danish girls at the station. We went to sit with them after they had been given hassle by pissed Greek blokes. They stayed with us all the way to Athens.

            On the train, we finished off the third bottle of Ouzo and bought cans of lager which we drank until 6:30. Fell asleep then for three hours. Todays total - 6 pints, 2 Tsipouro and 1 bottle of ouzo.

            We arrived in Athens at about midday. On the train as we were entering Athens, blokes were walking round handing out leaflets advertising youth hostel type places. We chose one called Hotel Joy and went to book in. We got a room for three for about DR600 each (approx £4.50) and left our stuff there. It was not as nice as our last room but it was still a lot better than sleeping on trains. The toilet was out of order. We left the hotel at about 1:30 and went to find the Acropolis. We had moussaka on the way which was a bit tasteless but quite nice. The Acropolis was quite impressive. There is an excellent view of Athens from it.

            We went back to the hotel and wrote postcards and had a bath. We went down to the bar for the evening and had a couple of drinks before going out and buying food (takeaway pizza and chips). We went back to the bar for a pint and then went to a bar next door to a local disco.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We sat there for half an hour to see if anyone was going in. No-one was so we went back to the hotel bar. We argued all night about politics which was pretty pointless as no-one really knew what they were talking about. At about 1:15 we went back to our room for another pint and then went out to the disco. There was still hardly any people there so we went back to the bar next door. we had a pint and me and Dave played backgammon until about 2:30. We went back to the hotel by 3 and then went sight-seeing in the mixed shower unit. Quite impressive scenery in there too! Went to bed and straight to sleep at 3:30. Today we only had eight pints each.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday August 14th</span>
            I woke up before the others and had a bath, the fourth in four days. Dave was next up and he did likewise. While we were waiting for Regan to get ready, Dave and I went out to buy something we could all eat for lunch. After walking round various supermarkets, we eventually decided to buy a 13lb water melon which we took back to the hotel. At 11:30 we checked out and went into the town centre to send postcards home. Regan thought he had lost his camera but he had left it at the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We had to catch the 1pm train from Athens to Patras but when we arrived at the station we discovered it was fully booked. We left our rucksacks chained together at the station and walked to a park where we sat down and ate the water melon.

            We then went to The National Art Museum. I got in cheap using Dave's 1983 I.S.I.C. card but I got thrown out for having a camera without a camera ticket. While I was waiting for Dave and Regan to come out I saw the two Danish girls we met on the train. They are going to Corfu tomorrow. We eventually left Athens on the 3:45 train which was the worst train we have so far been on. Me and Dave had to sit on the floor by the toilet. Regan had a seat at the other end of the train. We arrived in Patras at 9 and went to buy tickets for the ferry. our ticket cost DR3150. We got on a boat at 9:20 and it left at about 10. We sat around drinking (5 pints) and eating until about 2 and then went to sleep in our sleeping bags on the deck.

            We arrived in Corfu at 9:00 and caught a bus to a campsite near Vatos on the West side of the island. It was quite crowded but we managed to find an almost flat spot to pitch our tents. The campsite was quite good. It had toilets, washing facilities and outdoor showers. There was also a supermarket, restaurant and bar there. After we had pitched our tents, we went to find the beach. We had been told that there were two beaches, one within walking distance and one you could only reach by bus. We got lost and ended up walking to the latter about three miles away. The beach was excellent. The sand was too hot to walk on  but the sea was cold and very refreshing. We stayed at the beach for about an hour and a half before going to an adjoining hotel to use their swimming pool and showers. We then went back to the campsite by bus. We had moussaka and a pint. In the afternoon we went to look for the nearer of the two beaches. We got lost again and found a third beach which was not as good. Dave and I had a short swim and then went back to the tent.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went to the campsite restaurant for tea (omelet and chips). After tea, we went to the campsite bar, where they were doing stupid Greek dances, before trying out the local discos. We went to The Country Club first which was quite good. We were talking to and dancing with two German girls. Regan threw up in the bog after seeing a turd. We then went to the Pam Pam Disco where we only stayed about 15 minutes due to the bar being closed. We then went back to The Country Club where we had our last (7th) pint. We then returned to the campsite at about 1:30. Me and Dave took the flysheet off our tent, laid our sleeping bags on it and went to sleep. Regan slept in his tent at the top of the slope and kept sliding down all night.

            Dave and I woke at 7:30 and we decided to go into Corfu Town. We left Regan still fast asleep in his tent. We went into town to look at moped prices and to buy food. We also went to the ferry terminal to see if we could find the two Danish girls that we had met in Thesalonika. We couldn't find them but they may not be coming in today. We had got into town on the bus for nothing as the conductor had not seen us. We walked around the town and bought a water melon and a loaf of bread before returning to the campsite by bus.

            We ate most of the water  melon outside the tents. We all went to the beach and found the one "within walking distance". The Greeks seem to have problems calculating distances. The beach was about two miles away along a dusty hilly track. Half of the beach was mostly filled with nudists. We sat halfway between the two beaches. We swam and sunbathed for about two and a half hours. I think I overdid the sunbathing as my back is a bit hot now. We walked back to the tent and had our second meal of the day - a third of a loaf of bread with a slice of ham and cheese. After a shower, we went to the bar and met a boring English bloke who we left after about 15 minutes. We then went to a taverna and had chips and a pint. We then went back to the tent buying 1½ litres of wine on the way. We left the wine in the tent and went back to the bar where we met two Canadian blokes, also doing Inter Rail. We went with them to the two discos which were both empty. We didn't stay long before returning to the tent to knock back the wine. Went to sleep again outside the tent at about 2:30. Slept well due to the five pints nad half litre of wine.

            Woke at 7:30 and me and Dave went into town again. Still no sign of the Danish girls. We bought loafs of bread for lunch and tea. We had got into town free again but w paid DR40 to return to the campsite. We bought ham and cheese at the camp supermarket and ate one of the loafs of bread for lunch. Regan discovered that he had left his torch on all night and the batteries were flat. After lunch, we caught a bus to Glyfada Beach with the two Canadians. We spent about two hours swimming and sun-bathing and then went to the hotel swimming pool. At about 5, we hitched back to the campsite. We had two lifts and got back in about five minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We ahd tea when we got back, ham and cheese rolls again. After showering we made our way to the bar for the second time today(one pint at lunchtime). We were joined halfway through the evening and all of us proceeded to get smashed out of our minds. We got through approximately 12 pints each though we are not really sure. Me and Dave combined to drop one full bottle on the floor, soaking my camera in the process. We kept all the bottles on the table which looked quite impressive by the end of the evening. We were talking to some English blokes at the end of the evening but were not really sure who. We were also talking to some Dutch girls who were being chatted up by some Greeks. As Dave said this morning, we know about half the people on the campsite but are not really sure which half. I don't really remember leaving the bar but apparently we drank half a bottle of wine before we crashed out.

            We have now had 81 pints each and 15½ litres of wine between us. We are rapidly running out of money which is not really surprising.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday August 18th</span>
            We regained consciousness at about 11. Regan had fallen asleep with his personal cassette on and the batteries were flat. We bought lunch at about 12, ham and cheese rolls. We just lazed around by the tent till about 2 and then went to the beach with the long name beginning with M. We met the Canadians there. They had built a sand-castle. We lay on the beach until about 5 and then walked back. The weather was not so hot today so we were able to stay longer without burning. Regan buit a dick out of sand while we were on the beach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We had ham, cheese and bread  for tea (our fifth consecutive meal of ham, cheese and bread). After showering, etc we went to the bar for a pint and then we went with a bunch of German and Dutch blokes to a taverna near the village of Vatos. The taverna was called Spiros and it was pretty full. We had spaghetti because it was pretty cheap, it would have been quite nice if it was warm. After a couple of pints, the German bloke (Hans) who we were with bought a round of Metaxas. For DR20 you got a double measure of a drink about the strength of Ouzo. We had another four of these and then went to The Country Club with a lot of people including the Canadians (Peter and Sean) and two English girls.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got to The Country Club they were giving out free punch which had nearly run out. I had two glasses and then about a pint of lager. We were all relatively sober except for Hans and Regan. We danced, mainly with the two English girls until about 3am and then went back to the tent to crash out. I have got heat bumps all over me.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday August 19th</span>
            A predictable day really. Regan woke to find his torch was still on and the batteries were flat. We had eggs for lunch/breakfast, one hard boiled, one soft boiled, with bread. The bread was disgusting. We went to the bar lunch time and drank water while writing diaries. Caught a bus to Glyfada Beach at 2, swam and sunbathed, etc until about 6 when we caught the bus back. We had cheese and tomato sandwiches for tea (toasted sandwiches).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went to the bar at about 9. We met an English bloke with an American friend and also the two English girls (Caroline and Kate) came over and joined us. We bought cigarettes for the girls as we had smoked most of theirs the night before. Regan bought them a drink again. Me and Dave had decided not to get pissed but after two pints and a few double Metaxas, it was obvious we were going to be smashed again. Some time during the evening we went and joined Peter and Sean who were sitting with a group of Canadians around a camp fire type thing. We stayed there for about an hour telling jokes and drinking bottles of wine. We then went to The Country Club which was totally empty. Me and Dave were well pissed by this time. We returned to the bar when The Country Club closed and had more Metaxa. I don't think we are the most popular people on the campsite at the moment. At about 3:30 we tried to wake up the two boring Australian girls in the tent next to us. Someone pissed on another tent near us and the owner of the tent seemed to think it was one of us though we are sure it wasn't. There is a lot of confusion over the order of the above events

            There is a lot of confusion over the order of the above events but it doesn't really matter. We had three pints each, 11 Metaxas and about half a litre of wine each. It was still a relatively cheap night due to Metaxa costing 20p a go. I have got hundreds of bloody heat bumps all over me. Running total 88 pints each, 17 litres of wine between us and several different shots.

            Regan woke up to find his torch had been on all night for the fourth day running. He probably spends more on batteries than we do on food! We had planned to go into town for the morning but we woke too late. We had egg and tomato rolls and a soft boiled egg for Breakfast/lunch. As usual we went to the beach in the afternoon. We went to Glyfada for the second day running. I had a headache on the beach mainly due to last nights drinking but not helped by the heat of the sun. The hotel swimming pool was closed and we came back on the 4:15 bus. Cheese and tomato rolls for tea.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We all just lazed around by the tent until about 9. No-one really felt like doing much. At  9 we went to the bar. Me and Regan had a couple of pints, Dave had one. At 11, me and Dave decided to crash out. Regan went to talk to the bunch of Canadians near by. At about 12 they decided to go back to the bar and they managed to persuade me to go as well. I had one more pint and spent a lot of time talking to a Canadian who I had been trying to drag to the bar the night before. I couldn't remember ever meeting him!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Today was the first time since we have been in Corfu that we haven't been drunk. I realised how uncomfortable the floor is where we are sleeping. The two Australian girls moved to a different part of the campsite this afternoon. I am getting pissed off with my heat bumps which I have now discovered are mosquito bites. It looks as if I have a chronic case of acne.

            Me and Dave got up just before 9 to go into town to buy presents. Regan didn't want to buy any so stayed in bed. We found out that there was no 9 o'clock bus so we started hitching. We hitched for an hour and then got the 10 o'clock bus. In town, I bought a t-shirt for Jane which is probably too big and a beach mat/blanket for Mum. The beach mat was a bad idea as it fills my rucksack and she will be receiving it in the middle of September. We missed the 1:30 bus (mainly because there isn't a 1:30 bus) and had to wait in town until 2:30. We arrived at the camp site at 3 to find Regan had gone to the beach with Peter and Sean. We couldn't be bothered to walk to the beach so we did our washing (at last) and then sunbathed by the tent.

            In the evening, we had half a cheese and tomato roll each for tea. Money is getting tight. We bought 1½ litres of wine each for the evening for a total of about £3. At about 9, we went to the bar for a pint and said goodbye to the Canadians who left at 10. After they had gone, we went and sat near the tents and started on the wine. Caroline and Kate were with us at first but they went to bed after about 15 minutes. After they had gone, we invited three Dutch girls to join us and they came and chatted with us for quite a while. Sometime during the evening, we all went to The Country Club disco but I do not remember it at all as I had had a lot too much wine. I fell asleep at the Country Club at about 2 and stayed there until 4. As soon as I got back to the campsite, Dave put me in my sleeping bag and I fell asleep. The Dutch girls had booked a taxi for 5 o'clock as they were catching the 6 o'clock boat.
         </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            My heat bumps were a bit better today but I think I have caught a cold. Apparently we had taken our dog to The Country Club with us. It has been hanging around us for the past few days mainly due to us feeding him and making a fuss of him. We tried giving him wine earlier in the evening but he refused it. We decided tonight that we would leave the campsite tomorrow morning and sleep in town the night before catching the ferry.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday August 22nd</span>
            We woke at about 9 and somehow we had packed everything away by 10. Before we left we met a group of English blokes who had moved in overnight and we gave them all the stuff we didn't want to carry, like washing powder, salt cellar and the football that Hans had given us when he left. We caught the bus into town and put our stuff into a left luggage place. We had lunch in a fast food place, cheeseburger and chips followed by slices of toast. At 1:30 we caught a bus to a beach on the East side of Corfu called Ipsos. The beach wasn't nearly as nice as the ones we were used to but it was quite pleasant once you got in the water. Dave and I swam for about a mile along the coast and then walked back. We sat on the beach all afternoon and then had an English breakfast for tea. While we were in Ipsos, we bought ham, cheese and bread rolls for the ferry trip tomorrow. We caught a bus back into town at 6:30 and then went sight-seeing for about an hour.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went to an off-license to buy drink for the evening. Dave and I bought a bottle of banana colada which I don't think is supposed to be drunk neat but was very nice anyway. Regan bought a bottle of wine which was disgusting.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We collected our sleeping bags from the left luggage and then went and had a pint. After that we went back to the port where we played cards until the police told us we couldn't stay there. We went outside, carried on playing until we had finished our drink and at about 12:30 we went to sleep in our sleeping bags in the middle of the port car park.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday August 23rd</span>
            We woke at 7 and went to find out about our ferry. We found out that we had to pay DR100 stopover fee before we got on the boat which was annoying as we had made sure the night before that we spent all our Greek money. I had to change some of the lira we had leftover from Venice.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went to catch the ferry at about 7:45. It was due to leave at 8:15 but it was five hours late getting in and it eventually left at 1pm. It seems we are getting used to long delays as the time passed quite quickly. Once we were on the boat, we found ourselves sitting in the same place as on the previous boat trip. We spent the seven hour journey sunbathing and playing cards. Dave and I ate our ham and cheese rolls. Regan wouldn't eat his, complaining that the bread was stale and he was feeling ill due to being woken at 9 the previous day. Dave and I also shared a beer.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We arrived in Brindisi at about 7 and after we had been through customs (Regan went through twice) we walked to Brindisi Central Station. We checked out train times and then went outside for a meal. Regan had a pizza that he couldn't finish. Me and Dave had ice cream plus the remains of Regan's pizza. At 9:21 we caught the train to Taranto (1 hour 20 minutes) where we changed to the train to Rome. We were sharing a compartment with six Italians. It was very uncomfortable and I didn't get a lot of sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Running total: 94 pints each, 21½ litres of wine between us and an unknown number of shorts. My heat bumps have almost all gone. Our drinking has slowed down almost to a halt. We are getting very short of money. I'm worried about the drinking.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday August 24th</span>
            We arrived in Rome at about 8:30. There was a long queue for left luggage so we walked around for a bit looking for the next station. After we worked out that this would be quite a long walk, we returned to the main station and joined the queue. When we had left our rucksacks we went sight-seeing. We went to The Colosseum, St Peters Square, The Vatican and a whole lot of other places I had never heard of. We knew we would not be allowed into The Vatican wearing shorts so we had taken jeans to change into. We got a lot of funny looks as we put them on over our shorts on the steps of The Vatican and again when we took them off. I was quite disappointed that the pope wasn't in. While we were walking round Rome we were looking for somewhere that sold pizzas. It seemed that all the pizzerias were closed until the evening. We had a slice of cold pizza and more ice-cream for lunch. We finished sight-seeing at about 5 and went to sit in a park where we drank coke and threw stones at a tree for an hour.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We then bought cheese and bread rolls for tomorrow as we thought food in Monte Carlo would be expensive. We managed to find a pizza place that was open and we all ordered pizzas. Dave and I had pilchard pizzas, Regan had a pizza fungi. Regan ordered us all water  which I had to pay for as he had no money. It cost 75p which was annoying as we were sitting about 50 yards from a drinking fountain. The pizzas were excellent and me and Dave had another one each.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After eating, we went back to the station, collected our rucksacks, which I am sure we paid too much money for, and then went to wait for our train. It got in at 9:45 and left an hour later. We were sharing a compartment with three Italian. It was a lot more comfortable than the night before. Me and Dave played Beat your Neighbor and Top Trumps until falling asleep. This was our first totally alcohol free day. We will all have withdrawal symptoms if this goes on for much longer.

            A more eventful day really. When we woke, our compartment was still full of Italians. We arrived in Monte Carlo at about 10 and after we had put our rucksacks in lockers, we went sight-seeing. We walked nearly all the way round the race circuit - under the tunnel, round the hairpin, casino square, etc. We stopped and had our cheese rolls on the way. Dave and I tried to get into the Monte Carlo Casino but not surprisingly the doormen stopped us. We did actually get to do some gambling while we were there. I lost 2Fr in a fruit machine.

        <p class="diary-text">
            At about 1, we left Monte Carlo and went to Nice. When we got there, we walked straight to the beach with our rucksacks and then spent 2 - 3 hours swimming and sun-bathing. The beach wasn't nearly as good as the ones in Corfu but it was good to get back into the sea again. We all had showers before walking back to the station. We didn't really see a lot of Nice before leaving. We caught a train from Nice to Antibes. We had heard that the French trains were supposed to be good and this was probably the best one we had been on so far. It was really comfortable and very smooth and fast.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got to Antibes we came out of the station and saw what looked like a cheap bar. When we went in we found that it was only about 60p a pint for Stella so at  last we could start drinking again. We had three pints each and spent about an hour playing bar football. Regan met a girl who knew him even though he didn't know her. She was from Sussex Uni. After our three pints, we went back to the station to put our stuff into lockers. We went back to the bar to go to the toilet but an old woman came and threw us out. We tried explaining that we had been drinking there all evening but she didn't seem to understand. We went into the town centre of Antibes comparing the prices of food. We bought pizzas for about £2 each and then we walked round looking for somewhere to crash for the night. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After a lot of discussion, we got on a train to Biot, about five minutes away and went to look for a campsite. We found one for about £2 a night. It was about midnight when we arrived at the site so we hurriedly put up a tent, left our stuff in it and went to look round the funfair next to the site. Some of the rides looked quite impressive but also expensive. Me and Dave played bar football again, then we went back to the campsite, dismantled the tent so we wouldn't have to pay and went to sleep on the flysheet.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday August 26th</span>
            We woke at 9 to find most of our stuff was damp due to the dew. We all had warm showers for the first time in two weeks. The washing facilities were better that those at Vatos but that was about the only thing that was better. We paid and left the site at about 10:45 and caught a train to Cannes. When we arrived in Cannes we wlaked straight down to the beach where we remained until  2:30. The beach was far batter than the one in Nice. We left the beach and returned to the station where we bought The News of the World. Swansea lost their first game of the season.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We caught a train from Cannes to St Raphael which was quite a nice place. We spent the remainder of the afternoon lying on a grass bank next to the beach and eating ice-cream. We walked round the town for a bit until we found a hamburger joint which was quite cheap. We had double cheeseburgers and coke.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we had finished eating we walked around the coast until we found a beach with a shower. Dave and I went for a short swim before showering and changing. we then spent an hour walking along the seafront comparing prices of various restaurant menus before settling for another double cheeseburger in the same place as before. We walked back to the station and caught the 11:15 train to Port Bou. It arrived half an hour late. We were sharing the compartment with two French blokes who left the train at Marseilles. We then had six seats to ourselves so we could fold them down to make beds. I fell asleep at about 1:15. Today was another alcohol free day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday August 27th</span>
            We awoke at about 6:30 with the train already in Port Bou where we had to change. When we got off the train my rucksack strap broke and I had to carry it on one shoulder through the French and Spanish customs. We caught a slowish train to Barcelona, the express requiring a supplement to be paid, and arrived there at 10. We ate ice-creams at the station while repairing our rucksacks. We didn't see many sights in Barcelona. After we had walked around for about two hours we found a bar which was quite cheap so we had just over a pint each. We then walked about half a mile before deciding to go by tube to the football ground. The stadium looked quite impressive from the outside but we couldn't get inside as the tours don't start until Sept 3rd.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked right around the outside of the stadium before catching the tube to another station in Barcelona. From here we went to Sitges where again we went straight to the beach. Regan didn't want to go swimming as there were no showers so Dave and I went in. The water was great with quite big waves due to the strong wind. Not long afte rwe got out, it started to cloud over (just after Regan had put on sun tan oil). We quickly changed and left the beach and went into the nearest bar. We had only just got in when it started pouring with rain. We stayed in the bar for about an hour drinking only half a pint each while watching the thunder and lightening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We left the bar and bought bread and expensive cheese for the evening meal and then returned to the station to eat it. We then caught a train to Salou which was bout 20 minutes late. When we got to Salou we were still in the middle of the storm so we decided not to stay long. We spent about an hour and a half in the bar having two pints each and then caught a train to Alicante. This came in an hour late at 11:45. After looking for seats on the train for about 15 minutes, we all just crashed out in our sleeping bags in the corridor. Today we passed 100 pints each, the total being 101 pints, a cause for a celebration.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday August 28th</span>
            We woke at 6:15 an hour before the train got into Alicante. When we arrived there, we discovered that there were two stations and we had to go to the other one, the other side of town. We had a twenty minute walk to the station and when we got there, we discovered it was run by a private company and we couldn't use our Inter Rail tickets. We paid about 90p each to get to Benidorm where we arrived at 9:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Outside the station at Benidorm, me and Dave bought a huge box of biscuits which lasted us all day for about 40p each. As we were walking to the beach from the station we came to a Welsh bar where we had a half of lager. Regan had a meal there. We spent most of the morning walking round the town looking for discos, etc for later and also trying to find somewhere to leave our rucksacks. Me and Dave had egg, burger and chips in an English bar and a pint of bitter each. After this, we all went to the beach where we spent an hour in the sea throwing a tennis ball to each other and then spent about half an hour sun-bathing before it started raining again. We hurriedly packed our rucksacks and then went to The Pluck Inn for a drink. When the rain stopped, we continued our search for somewhere to leave our rucksacks, again without success.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We revisited some of the bars we had visited earlier and then at about 11 we went to the beach. Me and Dave went for a swim and found that the water was quite warm. After we had dried and changed we went to sleep behind a pile of deck-chairs. We had expected to leave all our stuff in left luggage lockers as soon as we had got here but it appears they don't have them much in Benidorm. We are going to have to get rid of our rucksacks soon before we can start using the discos, etc. Today we had five pints.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday August 29th</span>
            We were woken at 8 by a deck chair attendant who wanted to set up his chairs. Someone had nicked my swimming trunks. We walked into town and went to sit in a park for about half an hour before going to Bar Gwent for breakfast. We all had pasty and chips and two cups of tea.

            After eating we went to the beach where we spent most of the day. While we were in the sea we spent our time throwing the tennis ball to each other and also a group of English girls who seemed quite keen on joining in. We were in the water for a total of about four hours all through the day and spent the reat of the time sun-bathing. I have got sunburn in my left armpit.

            We left the beach at 6:30 and went to The Pluck Inn where we ate spaghetti bolognaise and spent three hours drinking a pint and a half while trying to work out what to do with the last week of the holiday. We didn't really decide on much. We left The Pluck Inn at 9:30 and walked along the front until we found a suitable pile of deckchairs where we made sure everything was safely packed in our rucksacks and then fell asleep  at about 10:30. We still haven't got rid of our rucksacks but it seems now that we can't really afford to go into any discos anyway so it doesn't matter so much. Running total is now 107½ pints each plus 21½ litres of wine.

            A similar day to yesterday. We woke at 9:30, went to Bar Gwent for pasty and chips and then spent the day on the beach. At about 1, Dave and I went to "our" hotel to cash a £20 travelers cheque and to try out the swimming pool and shower. We also walked round town looking at souvenirs before going back to the beach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we all left the beach at about 6 we bought cheese and bread rolls from the supermarket. We ate them outside a cafe overlooking the main beach We went from there to a fairly cheap bar where we had a pint of lager for 40p and then we went back to the English bar which we visit regularly now. I had a much need shave while I was there and also cleaned my teeth for the first time in ages. We left there at 10:30 and went to the same place on the beach as last night. We discovered that two girls who sleep further down the beach from us had hidden their rucksacks in a pile of deck-chairs and gone out so we decided to do likewise. We all put on long trousers , hid our rucksacks and went to check out the local discos. We found a couple that were free to get in but most of the big discos were expensive. The second free on we went to was a pub/disco. They were showing a video of Rocky III of which we caught the last 10 minutes and they also showed the video of Two Tribes by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It was quite good surprisingly. We left there at about 1 and returned to the beach buying cheeseburgers on the way. We got back to find our rucksacks in tact and we got to sleep by about 1:30. Regan has lost his torch!

            <span class="diary-date">Friday August 31st</span>
            We woke at about 10 and we moved to a spot on the beach about 20 yards from where we had been sleeping. We stayed there until about 12:30 when we went to our hotel for showers. We stayed there until about 12:30 when we went to our hotel for showers. We then went to a restaurant where we could eat as much as we wanted for about £2.50. We all stuffed ourselves. We had two big platefuls of all sorts of hot and cold meats, chips, potatoes, salad, peas, paella and cheese. Each plateful was bigger than any meal I have had in the last month. We then started on puddings, again, two big platefuls this time with melon slices, fruit cocktail, peaches and loads of different flavour ice-creams. We had half a pint of lager with the meal.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            By the time we had finished, movement was extremely difficult so we just went round the corner to a video bar where we ended up staying about 11 hours. We watched The Deep, Rocky II and III, Return of the Jedi and Death Wish II. Return of the Jedi was the best one. We had one pint in the afternoon and a tequila sunrise and pina colada during happy hour.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We left there at about 1am and went to our usual spot on the beach to crash out. Regan knocked a glass of the table while we were watching the films.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday September 1st</span>
            We woke at 10 and walked toour usual daytime spot on the beach. Dave and I went swimming while Regan went and bought his first meal of the day. When he returned, Dave and I went into town and bought a load of bread rolls and a packet of cheese. We had four cheese rolls each for breakfast and then went back to the beach where we stayed for most of the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At 4, we went to Sherry's bar where they had live commentary of Liverpool v QPR from BBC World Service. We stayed there to hear the football results. Swansea lost to York. We left there at about 6 after Regan had had his second meal of the day and we had eaten four bread rolls each. We then went to the video bar again. Dave and I watched the last two thirds of Police Academy while Regan went out for a meal and then we all went and watched the last half of Flashdance in The Beachcomber where we had seen Two Tribes a couple of nights ago. When this had finished, we decided that as this was our last night in Benidorm, we should get rid of our rucksacks and go to a disco. Dave climbed into a building site to look for somewhere to leave them but he came back a lot quicker when an alsation appeared from it's kennel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We eventually left our rucksacks in an underground hotel car park and headed back to the discos. On the way we went to the video bar we went to yesterday and bought two cocktails each. Regan had his fourth meal of the day. I had two pina coladas. When we had finished these, we went to another bar where it was still happy hour. We had three tequila sunrises each in 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We were asked to leave one disco because we wouldn't buy any drinks so we went back to Beachcombers where we saw Two Tribes again. We went from there to Lennon's Bar where there was quite a good disco. The place was covered with Beatles posters and pictures. We danced and drank there for most of the night. Later on, we went into the disco next door which was more like a proper disco but not as good. We left there and collected our rucksacks at about 3:30 and went to crash out on the beach. Today's total: 5 pints plus 5 cocktails each.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday September 2nd</span>
            We woke at about 10 and moved to our usual spot on the beach. Regan went for breakfast at Bar Gwent and when he came back, Dave and I went and bought four bread rolls each and a bottle of water. We ate the rolls on the way back to the beach. We stayed on the beach until about 3. I found the weather too hot today and I was in and out of the sea every five minutes trying to cool down.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked with our rucksacks to Lennon's where they were showing Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom at 5pm. While we were waiting for the film, we took it in turns to go to the hotel to swim and shower. We watched the film which was pretty good, and left there at 6:45. While we had been there, Regan had sausage, beans and chips, Dave and I had cups of tea.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked from Lennon's to the station. The walk took about half an hour. It was uphill and carrying the rucksacks didn't make it any easier. We caught the 7:55 train to Alicante where we had another half hour walk across town to the main station. While we waited for our train, Regan had a hamburger and Dave and I had one between us. We caught the 11:23 to Madrid. We were sharing a compartment with a couple with two children. After trying for ages to get to sleep, Dave crashed out on the floor and Regan and I ended up sleeping in the corridor.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday September 3rd</span>
            We woke at about 7:40 and packed up our sleeping bags, etc. The train arrived on Madrid at 8:15 and we spent about two hours in the station, first of all looking for left luggage and then getting money out. While Dave and I were waiting for Regan, an old bloke came up to us and showed us a card which said "I have somewhere to hold your luggage". We all went with him and he led us to a grotty little hut type building where we all left our rucksacks for 100 pesetas each. We got a 100 peseta discount due to the woman giving us the wrong change.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We caught the tube into the centre of Madrid and went into a McDonalds for breakfast - Big Mac and chips + a pint of coke for £2. We went from there to see the sights of Madrid. There aren't many notable sights but the Royal Palace was quite impressive. We went to a bar at lunchtime and had a small beer. We then went to a large park where we spent most of the afternoon sitting in the shade. We left the park at 4 and walked back to McDonalds for tea. I just had a cheeseburger. We left there and sat in the shade outside the opera house for about half an hour. Dave bought about 30 liquorice chews. We went from there back to the station by tube. Before we got off the tube, we realised that the station was only about a mile from the Bernabéu Stadium. We went back there by tube and spent about 15 minutes looking at the ground. One of the outside gates was open so we actually managed to look inside the ground.

            We walked from the ground to the station where we all washed and shaved, etc. We queued for about half an hour to get our tickets stamped only to discover we had to pay a supplement of £2. I had to use my Barclaycard as no-one had any money. When we got on the train we had a compartment to ourselves. Dave and I had a row of seats to crash on and Regan slept on the floor because he lost the toss. He would have slept on the floor anyway since me and dave had already taken the seats but tossing up for it seemed to make him happier. We all crashed out at about 11.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday September 4th</span>
            We woke at about 7:45 and arrived in Hendaya at 8. After going through Spanish and French customs we caught the 9:00 train to Bordeaux. We arrived in Bordeaux at about 11 and I tried without success to cash my last travelers cheque. We had lunch in a Manhattan Burger place and discussed what we are going to do with our last few days. We decided to go to Nantes on the 2:07 train which we caught after having a brief look around the town. On the way to Nantes it started raining. We decided that this would make it harder to sleep rough so we made another minor change to our plans. We decided to go to Switzerland. This would mean an overnight train journey so we wouldn't have to find anywhere to sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We spent most of the four hour journey to Nantes and working out details of our diversion. Dave and I bought a French loaf each to eat in Switzerland. We caught the 6:30 train to Angers where we spent about three hours. We had a hamburger in tomato sauce with chips in a restaurant and then walke daround the town for about an hour before returning to the station. We played cards until the train to Lyon arrived. When we got on the train at 11:23, we discovered that you had to pay a supplement of about £5 to have a couchette and that there were no normal seats. We sat in the corridor playing cards until the guard came. He told us that we would have to get off the train at the next stop which was Pierre des Corps near Tours. we had nearly a two hour wait for the next train to Lyon which had normal seats again and was quite empty. We again had a compartment to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            This time I lost the toss and slept on the floor. Dave and I had finished half our bread by the time we had gone to bed. Regan phoned home three times today.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday September 5th</span>
            We woke at about 9:30 and arrived in Lyon at 9:45. We walked around Lyon for about two hours. We had breakfast in a McDonalds type place, the usual cheeseburger cheese and chips and coke. Dave and I bought 1kg of pears for 5 Fr. We returned to the station and caught the 12:13 train to Geneva. We sat at the wrong end of the train so we had to change ends at Bergrade. We waited at Geneva station for about half an hour before catching a train to Lausanne. While we were at Geneva, we met an old bloke who came and started talking to us when he realised we were English. He was on the same train to Lausanne as us and seemed quite keen to give us all the details of everything we passed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We put our rucksacks in lockers at Lausanne and caught the next train to Montreux where we arrived at about 2:30. We spent about two hours in Montreux. The scenery was excellent but slightly spoilt by the pouring rain. We went to a souvenir shop to buy a load of Swiss chocolate. Dave and I had about six bars each and since neither of us had Swiss Francs, I tried to pay with my Barclaycard. the woman in the shop wouldn't accept it unless we spent about 50Fr (about £20) so we bought a box of 200 cigarettes as well. We caught the 5:30 train back to Lausanne where it was still raining heavily. We went to a McDonalds for tea. Regan bought a meal and a cheeseburger each for Dave and I which we paid him for in French Francs. We had a brief look at the town before collecting our rucksacks and returning to Geneva. We walked round the town centre for about an hour and then decided to catch a train back to Lyon where we would be able to stay the night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We caught the 9:30 train to Lyon P.D. and caught a train from there to Lyon Perrache, the main Lyon station. We went down into a waiting room at about midnight and spent about 10 minutes sorting our stuff out before getting into our sleeping bags. We spent about 30 seconds in our sleeping bags before we were moved on as the waiting room was about to close. We then moved to a spot on the main concourse where we slept until we were woken by floor cleaners at 4. We moved to another spot where we remained for the rest of the night.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday September 6th</span>
            We were woken at 7:30 by a bloke going round clearing people off the floor. We had a one and a half hour wait until our train left in which time I went and changed my last travelers cheque and Regan went and had a pizza for breakfast. We caught the T.G.V. to Paris. We had reserved seats on it the day before. It was a quick journey due to the train being able to travel at speeds of up to 270km/h.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We arrived in Paris Gare de Lyon at 11:10 and went by Metro to Gare du Nord where we left our stuff in lockers. We left the station at about 12:50 and went off to see the sights. On the way we found a beefburger place where we had a free Giant burger because we had a card saying e had bought three meals from another branch. We walked from there for about 20 minutes until we came to The Louvre. I got in for half price again with Dave's I.S.I.C. We saw the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo plus a load of other paintings, etc. I saw a girl from Clyne who I don't know. We left the Louvre and walked up to the Champs-Élysées from where we could see the Arc de Triumph

            We then went to the Eiffel Tower. We couldn't afford to go right to the top so we paid to walk up to the second stage. It took quite a while to walk up there but the view made it worthwhile. After walking down again, we caught an underground train to Notre Dame Cathedral. Regan had told Dave and I that if we bought our Inter Rail tickets we could use the underground for nothing so Dave and I went free. Regan had forgotten his Inter Rail ticket so had to pay. We looked around the cathedral and then got the metro to the opera house. By the time we had got there, it had started raining so we didn't stay long. We started to walk back to the station calling in for beefburgers on the way. I tried to buy 600 cigarettes on the way as well but the shop took Visa for everything but fags.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We got back to the station intending to catch the 6:50 train to Calais. We were ready by 6:29 so decided we might as well get the 6:30. This was very lucky since we discovered on the train that there was no 6:50 on a Thursday and that the 6:30 was the last train. We arrived in Calais at 9:45 and walked to the port where we bought our tickets again with Visa. We got on the boat at 11:15 and it left at 11:30. As soon as the boat got going, we went to the duty free shop where I bought 24 bottles of Stella, 2 litres of wine, 1 litre of Bells, 200 cigarettes plus half a litre of Regan's spirits which he wasn't planning to buy. Dave and I paid half each for his litre of vodka. We then spent the rest of the journey trying to cram everything into our rucksacks. We eventually succeeded in doing this but the rucksacks now weigh about twice as much as they did before.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got to Dover, Regan decided that he would stay there for the night and go to Brighton for a day on the way back. dave and I decided to start hitching back and went to stand by the London road. After about half an hour we got a lift to Canterbury which was only 13 miles up the road. We got dropped in a really useless place and ended up hitching at the side of a dual-carriageway which is practically impossible. We got fed up with this after baout half an hour and at about 2am we decided to walk the four miles into Canterbury town centre. We realised this was as stupid idea after about half a mile and so decided to sleep rough for the night. We managed to find a relatively dry spot under a load of trees and we put the flysheet on the ground since we couldn't be bothered to pitch the tent. We fell asleep at about 2:30 hoping that it wouldn't rain. We woke again at about 4 and got into our sleeping bags since it had become a lot colder.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday September 7th</span>
            We woke at 6:30 and caught the 7:30 bus into Canterbury town centre. We caught the 8:16 train to London. Dave changed befroe London so he could get back without having to use the tube. I caught the tube across London to Paddington where I caught the 10:50 to Swansea. I arrived in Swansea at 2 and caught the 2:40 bus home to Ammanford. Got home at 3:40
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Final total: 117 pints each 21½ litres of wine between us.
