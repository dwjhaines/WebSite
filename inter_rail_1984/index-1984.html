            Left Pantyffynon at 9:15 to meet the 10:05 train from Swansea to Paddington. Dave got on the train at Newport and we drank the litre bottle of wine that I had with my packed lunch. regan had eaten most of his packed lunch before Port Talbot.

            We went by tube to Putney Bridge where Ray met us in his car. We went to The Bricklayers Arms and had a couple of pints. We then went to Ray's house before going back into central London. We killed time all afternoon until pub opening time. We had two pints in pub opposite Charring Cross Station before leaving on the 6:55 to Dover. We found a purse on the train which we handed over to police in Dover. We enclosed a note in the purse hoping that the female student to whom it belonged would write back. We had a pint in two different pubs in Dover town centre before going by bus to Eastern Docks. Arrived at the waiting room at 11:50. Everyone complaining of sore shoulders and being generally knackered. Regan broke his rucksack in one of the pubs.

            After a boring two hour wait at Dover, we finally left for Ostende at 1:00 am. the crossing took four hours most of which was spent trying to sleep in the baggage room. Got to Ostende at 6:00 and caught a connection to Brussels. The town didn't seem that exciting when we first walked round at 8 in the morning, but after we had left our rucksacks at the station and had our first pints of Stella things started to get better.

            We spent the whole day drinking and eating. I had bread rolls for breakfast, French loaf for lunch and a round loaf for tea. I am sick of bloody bread already. Altogether we had about 12 pints each (the weakest of which was Stella) in about eight different pubs. By the end of the day we were all quite pissed and finding our luggage and getting across Brussels to a different station caused a lot of confusion. No-one really knows how but at 22:22, we got on the train to Munich, found a compartment with couchettes and fell asleep instantly. Spent approx £10.

            Woke at 4:00 with a hangover. Didn't get back to sleep again until 5:30. By the time we got to Munich, my hangover had gone but both Dave and regan had woken with worse hangovers. We had a cup of tea near the station and then went back to the station to stuff our rucksacks into lockers.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked round Munich for most of the morning. Dave threw up in a bin and shortly afterwards we met Keith Hubber in Munich's red light district. We had lunch in McDonalds - Big Mac and chips, same as in England.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We spent the afternoon sight-seeing, churches, fountains, etc. We went by tube to The Olympic Stadium. It was pretty impressive. Me and Dave went paddling in an Olympic size duck pond nearby. Me and Dave went back into Munich for nothing because we didn't buy tickets. Regan paid about 50p.

            By the early evening, everyones hangovers had gone and we started drinking again. We found a cheapish pub which did really good value food (chicken schnitzel and chips and two pints). Went from there to a grotty pub and then to a red light district bar. We only had a half but it was quite an eventful stop. Went then to a really good cheap pub. We bought our pints and then went to sit in the middle of a square type place surrounded by trees. Finished our pints then legged it back to the station (because it was raining), nicked the locker keys and boarded the train to Verona (Brenner Express). The train left Munich at 11:58.

            We shared a compartment with an Irish girl who was also going to Corfu. I got about four hours sleep, being woken every half an hour or so by customs or guards, etc. We woke at 6:30 which was worrying as we were supposed to change trains at 6:00. By complete coincidence we had woken up in Verona where we were supposed to change and the train was half an hour late. We had to leg it off the train carrying our shoes and socks, etc and got on to the train to Venice (one and a half hours). We spent abot two hours at Venice station, first of all washing and shaving, then queuing to leave our rucksacks. We then spent the rest of the morning sight-seeing which would have been OK if it hadn't been pissing down with rain. We had pizzas for lunch but no lager (£2 a pint). We saw St Mark's Square, Rialto Bridge, etc then seemed what seemed like hours getting back to the station.
        </p>

            All the streets looked the same and the signposts appeared to be sending us round in circles. We bought bottles of wine on the way (6 at about 75p each). We got back to the station at about 1, soaking wet and collecting our rucksacks, then after a lot of confusion, got on a train to Belgrade. We boarded the train at about 2, three hours before it pulled out at 4:55.

            We played cards and drank wine until Trieste where me and Dave got off while the train waited at the station for an hour. We went and bought more wine (4 litres for £4) and I also managed to nick a Daily Mirror. We went back to the train and then proceeded to get pissed out of our minds. I fell asleep on the floor of our compartment at about 2 o'clock. I don't remember a lot about the train journey.

            So far we are all really enjoying the holiday and having a great time. I only hope the weather improves. I have just discovered that I threw up out of the train window last night. (We decided to leave Venice a day early due to it being expensive and also to the heavy rain. At this point, we are a day ahead of schedule)

            A relatively quiet day after the heavy drinking of last night. Arrived in Belgrade at 11am, two hours late. This meant that we had spent 21 hours sat on the same train. We got rid of our rucksacks and then headed for the town centre to look for food. We found that everywhere was really cheap. We had pizzas for 60p each and a pint for 30p. We then walked through town went sight-seeing round a park with a castle in it, finally ending up in a bar/restaurant overlooking The Danube. We had meat on sticks which was served on a large piece of veal with pieces of liver and chilies. I only tried a tiny piece of chili but it was probably the hottest thing I have ever tasted. It took about half an hour for my mouth to recover.

            After this we returned to the town and went for a pint. We were all sitting outside a bar when we realised we had to collect our rucksacks form left luggage within 40 minutes. We then got totally lost running around in circles and not apparently getting any nearer to the station. Eventually we made it with about a minute to spare. After a quick wash, we went out of the station, found a restaurant/cafe and had chicken and chips (90p). We then bought food and drinks for the next train journey and went to another bar. After this shut at 10:00, we went to the station to wait for the 11:58 train to Athens. It arrived an hour late and was probably the worst train so far. Packed as usual, me and Dave had to sleep on the corridor floor. We got to sleep by about 2. Today we had consumed seven pints each and one litre of wine between us.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday August 11th</span>
            We woke up at about 6 and went back to sit in a compartment filled with Yugoslavian blokes. The carriage we were in wasn't going all the way to Athens so we ahd to change coahes at Skopje. The only seats we could find were in a compartment occupied by three Swedish girls who were also going round with Inter Rail. Had quite an enjoyable journey from there drinking our two litres of wine, eating crisps & biscuits, playing cards and having pairs of tits flashed at us every five minutes. I wasn't concentrating much on the cards. When we eventually arrived in Thesolonika, we went and booked into a hotel (Hotel Vagina) which was quite impressive. We all had our first bath for a week then went out to sample local food and drink.

        <p class="diary-text">
            At 11, we came back to the hotel bar where we et two English blokes and talked to them until about 2:30. Got to bed by about 3 and fell asleep instantly. Today we had consumed eight pints each plus two litres of wine between us. So far we have had 37 pints each  plus 12½ litres of wine between us. Not bad for six days. Regan had a delayed hangover from the last three days. He threw up on the train and then bottled out of drinking the wine on the train.
