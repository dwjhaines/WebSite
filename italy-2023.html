           We were up just before 4am and had left Kingsclere by 4:20. We had to drive to Woking to pick up Steve but were still at the car park at Terminal 5 just after 5:30. Surprisingly, there was someone from the Meet and Greet waiting for us so we were in the terminal a few minutes later. By the time we had bought sandwiches to eat on the plane, we did not have too long to wait for the 7:05 flight to Rome which left on time
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was an uneventful flight of around two hours and we landed at Rome Fumicino at 10:20 local time. We got through immigration reasonably quickly and got out new passports stamped for the first time. We walked through the airport to the train station and got the 10:57 slow train (€8 each) towards the centre. We had one change before arriving at Termini at 11:52.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had booked an apartment about five minutes walk from the station. We came out of the station at the wrong side so it took us slightly longer to get there but we found it easily enough and were met outside the apartment by Alfonso who let us in. The apartment was still being cleaned when we arrived so we left our bags and headed out to start our sight-seeing.

          The weather was not great today so we decided to do some of the "indoor" sights this afternoon. We headed in the direction of Vatican City which is about 3.5 miles from where we are staying. It was a very enjoyable walk. We walked past the back of Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore which looked quite impressive (we probably need to go back to look at it from the front) and then found Vittoriano, a "massive mountain of white marble" that includes the tomb of the unknown soldier. We continued walking from there to Pantheon. It was raining quite heavily by the time we got here so we went straight inside. This was another spectacular building. Both of these last two sights were very impressive and Roz and I were not aware that we had seen them before. However, on looking at old photos we found that we had visited them both in 2003!

          We continued walking towards The Vatican. We got as far as Piazza Navona before stopping to have paninis for lunch. We wandered round the fountains in the square and then crossed the river and entered Vatican City. There was a queue of about 30 minutes to get into the church itself. I would probably not have bothered but it was worth it once inside. We wandered round the main part of the church and then exited via the tombs of the popes. We had all done enough sight-seeing by this time so walked out to the metro station, got a train back to Termini and walked back to the apartment.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After Roz and I had had our showers, we went out again. The area where we are staying, San Lorenzo, is a bit away from the main sights but was chosen because it has a few craft beer bars and restaurants. Our night out did not go quite as planned. We went to Artisan first. This was a nice enough bar with beer that we were all happy with so we stayed in there for a couple instead of trying anywhere else. The pizza place that Alfonso had recommended to us was not open on Mondays so we kept walking around until we found "Saltimbocca". The food in here was excellent particularly the starters. We had our first pizzas of the trip and a litre and a half of wine before walking back to the apartment.
