          We were up just before 4am and had left Kingsclere by 4:20. We had to drive to Woking to pick up Steve but were still at the car park at Terminal 5 just after 5:30. Surprisingly, there was someone from the Meet and Greet waiting for us so we were in the terminal a few minutes later. By the time we had bought sandwiches to eat on the plane, we did not have too long to wait for the 7:05 flight to Rome which left on time
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was an uneventful flight of around two hours and we landed at Rome Fumicino at 10:20 local time. We got through immigration reasonably quickly and got out new passports stamped for the first time. We walked through the airport to the train station and got the 10:57 slow train (€8 each) towards the centre. We had one change before arriving at Termini at 11:52.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had booked an apartment about five minutes walk from the station. We came out of the station at the wrong side so it took us slightly longer to get there but we found it easily enough and were met outside the apartment by Alfonso who let us in. The apartment was still being cleaned when we arrived so we left our bags and headed out to start our sight-seeing.

          The weather was not great today so we decided to do some of the "indoor" sights this afternoon. We headed in the direction of Vatican City which is about 3.5 miles from where we are staying. It was a very enjoyable walk. We walked past the back of Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore which looked quite impressive (we probably need to go back to look at it from the front) and then found Vittoriano, a "massive mountain of white marble" that includes the tomb of the unknown soldier. We continued walking from there to Pantheon. It was raining quite heavily by the time we got here so we went straight inside. This was another spectacular building. Both of these last two sights were very impressive and Roz and I were not aware that we had seen them before. However, on looking at old photos we found that we had visited them both in 2003!

        <p class="diary-text">
          We continued walking towards The Vatican. We got as far as Piazza Navona before stopping to have paninis for lunch. We wandered round the fountains in the square and then crossed the river and entered Vatican City. There was a queue of about 30 minutes to get into the church itself. I would probably not have bothered but it was worth it once inside. We wandered round the main part of the church and then exited via the tombs of the popes. We had all done enough sight-seeing by this time so walked out to the metro station, got a train back to Termini and walked back to the apartment.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After Roz and I had had our showers, we went out again. The area where we are staying, San Lorenzo, is a bit away from the main sights but was chosen because it has a few craft beer bars and restaurants. Our night out did not go quite as planned. We went to Artisan first. This was a nice enough bar with beer that we were all happy with so we stayed in there for a couple instead of trying anywhere else. The pizza place that Alfonso had recommended to us was not open on Mondays so we kept walking around until we found "Saltimbocca". The food in here was excellent particularly the starters. We had our first pizzas of the trip and a litre and a half of wine before walking back to the apartment.

          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st March</span>
          A slightly later start today than yesterday. We were all up by about 9. Roz and I walked out to a supermarket to buy food for breakfast which we ate in the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out for our second day of sight-seeing at about midday. We walked first to Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore. This time we did go to the front of it and also inside which was very good. The only two other things we really planned to see was the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. It was a mile walk from the Basilica to the Trevi Fountain. The fountain is still spectacular and worth seeing despite the amount of people crowded around it. After many photos, we made our way to The Spanish Steps which are not really that interesting although the views from the top were good. After a wander around the church at the top (just about reached my limit on churches now) we walked to the Quirinale Palace/Piazza which was OK and then headed to the Colosseum stopping for ice creams on the way.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We are planning on visiting the Colosseum properly on Friday but decided to go for a walk around it as it was not far off route. From there, Roz and Steve returned to the apartment and I went for a bit of a longer walk. I headed out to the river and crossed over to Trastevere to look for a bar I was keen to visit (Ma Che Siete Venuti A Fà). This looked another very good craft beer place but there were no tables available outside so I did not stop for a drink. From there it was about an hours walk back to the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again just after 6 and had a similar evening to yesterday.... with slightly more alcohol. As we had all liked the beer in Artisan, we went straight back there and had a few before going out to eat. The recommended pizza restaurant (Pizzeria Il Grano) was open today and we had another good meal with a couple of litres of wine. After eating, we returned to Artisan for a couple more before walking home.

          Steve had left by the time we got up. He wanted to get the fast early train to Naples so he can spend the day visiting Pompeii, etc. We were planning on getting one of the slower trains (€13 instead of €45) as we are not in any hurry to get there (we had seen most of the sights in the area on previous visits). We had breakfast in the apartment again and left at 11:15 to walk to the station. We bought our tickets and got on the 11:56 train which left on time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had not expected the train to be that good as it was the much cheaper option but it was quite modern and comfortable. It was fairly busy but we were able to get s set of four seats between the two of us and it was a reasonably enjoyable journey. We arrived at Napoli Centrale just before the scheduled arrival time of 14:40 and had a short walk down to the metro station which is adjacent to the main station. We had a journey of about 25 minutes on the metro to Campi Flegrei, the nearest station to where we are staying.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After the problems we had getting to the ground for the Swansea game nine years ago, we had booked a couple of rooms at Casa Teresa Bed and Breakfast about quarter of a mile from the ground. We walked past the ground to get there and once we had actually found the place, were shown our rooms in a very nice apartment. We left our bags in the room and went out for a walk around the ground and a look around the surrounding area before returning to the apartment for showers.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were a bit unsure what Steve's plans were so had a drink in our kitchen and then went out and waited in a local bar near the entrance to where we are staying. He turned up just after 7. We went back to the apartment so Steve could drop his bag off and then went out to eat at a restaurant also very close by. The pizzas here were the best of the trip so far. After eating we were going to return to the bar but everything in the area had closed so we went back into the restaurant for more drinks.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were in the restaurant until it was about to close and then had another drink in the apartment while we waited for Bob to arrive. There had been a bit of confusion about his ticket and we were not 100% sure that he was actually coming but he got into Naples just after 10 and Steve went to collect him from Campi Flegrei just after 11.
