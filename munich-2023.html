            We left Kingsclere at 9:50 and got to Heathrow by about 10:30. We left the car at the meet and greet and despite security being painfully slow, were in the departure area by 11:00. The flight was supposed to be at 12:40 but left about 30 minutes late. We landed in Munich at 16:00 and had a 20 minute delay getting through immigration. However, despite all the delays, by 16:30, we met Hoggy in Airbrau for a much needed first beer of the day.

         <p class="diary-text">
            After a litre in Airbrau, we got the S-Bahn into Haubtbahnhof and walked to our hotel. We were staying at the Augesten, somewhere we had no stayed before. It is only a few minutes walk form the station opposite the Ibis where we have stayed before. We dropped our bags in the room and headed straight out.

            First stop was the Löwenbräukeller which surprisingly was only a five minute walk from the hotel. Despite going there a few time before, I had not realised it was that close to the station. We had one in there and then got the tram to Karlsplatz. Next stop was the Augustiner Stammhaus. The beer hall part was open despite the website saying it was closed. We had food and beer in here before moving on to the tap room. We had a couple of rounds in here and then went to the pig pub. A couple in there sat by the pig and then we made it to the Hofbräuhaus. Leaving the Hofbräuhaus is a bit of a vague memory. I thought Roz and Hoggy went home by train and I decided to walk to get my steps but it appears that they walked as well. All ended up back in the hotel just after midnight.

            A bit of a messy day. I was still drunk when we woke up. Roz and I left the hotel at about 11 and bought breakfast at the station. We had a bit of a walk around the old town and met Hoggy in the Viktualienmarkt beer garden at 12:30. We had our first litre in there and then walked back to the Löwenbräukeller. Regan eventually turned up at about 2:30. Three of us ordered lunch but only got two meals... I didn't eat which did not help my drunkeness!

            We walked from there to the Augustinerkellar and had a couple in the garden before moving on to the Augustiner Bräustuben. We had one in there and then had meals in Bavaria. Things are getting very vague by this stage. After eating, we walked back into the centre and went to the tap room. Regan fell asleep outside and eventually disappeared. At some point we went to the Hofbrauhaus again but I do not really remember being in there. Walked home by about 11:30.
