                We checked out of the Luton Premier Inn by about 6:30 and drove the few miles to the airport. Getting through the airport was not too bad and our Wizz Air flight to Wroclaw left just about on time at 8:30. We appeared to be the only non-Polish people on the flight which landed on time at 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Getting through the airport did not take long and, after getting cash out, we got a taxi to the Mercure Hotel on the outskirts of the old town. It was cold and wet when we arrived but after leaving our stuff in the room, we headed out for a look around the old town..... and to start looking for dwarfs!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The main square is only about a five minute walk from where we are staying. We walked up to the square and went in search of somewhere for lunch. The place Roz wanted to eat at had closed down but we found another place doing plates of Polish Ravioli and soup which was all quite tasty and very cheap. We walked from there back to the square which was very spectacular. We spent about half an hour walking round taking photos and also collected our dwarf map.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the room for a couple of hours sleep. By the time we woke up, it was obvious that our air-con was not working and the room was very hot. After about an hour of discussions with various hotel staff, they agreed to move us to another room. We could not move rooms until 8:00 for some reason so we headed back to the square for a couple of drinks while we waited. We had a couple of beers in Beer Halle, a Bavarian style place, before going back to the hotel and moving to a "privilege room" on the sixth floor. The room was not quite as big but had excellent views and an air-con unit that was slightly better than the previous one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to the square to continue drinking. We had one in the excellently named Zloty Pies Brewery and then went to Spitz, the third big brewery in the square. Something was going on here as we could not get a drink despite it being only about 20% full so we went instead to a more normal type of bar just off the main square. We discovered that one of the big Polish brewers produces a wheat beer which was very good news so remained in there for the rest of the evening
