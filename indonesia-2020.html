                I finished work at 4:00 and drove back to Basingstoke to collect Roz who had got there from Kingsclere by bus. We had an uneventful drive to Heathrow where the car was collected by someone from a meet and greet service. It took about an hour from when we arrived to get rid of the car, check in our luggage and get through security but by 18:30 we were making our way to the Premium Plaza lounge 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a very enjoyable three hours in the lounge and certainly got our £30's worth in food and drink. We made our way to the plane at 9:30 and took off on time at 22:05 on the Singapore Airlines flight to Changi. We had another couple of hours of drinking on the plane and are not really sure what time we went to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 17th January</span>
                We landed at Changi on time at about 17:30 local time. We did not need to collect our luggage as it was checked in all the way to Manado. We left the airport and got the MRT one stop to where we had booked a room at the Park Avenue Hotel for the night. The hotel was chosen as it is only a couple of minutes walk from the MRT station. It is located in some sort of business park which is not ideal but there are a few restaurants around it as well as the inevitable shopping mall. We had quick showers and a couple of drinks in the room before going out to eat at one of the near-by Indian restaurants.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we had a wlak round the shopping mall before returning to the room where we drank the litre of duty free Bacardi that we had bought when we arrived at Changi. Got to bed at about 1:30
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 18th January</span>
            We were awake at 7:00 had showers and returned to the airport on the MRT. We had breakfast at McDonalds before boarding the 9:20 Silk Air flight to Manado. The flight was again uneventful (apart from an aborted landing!) and we arrived in Manado just before 1pm. I was feeling quite rough by this time due to two nights of too much alcohol and not enough sleep. We were met at the airport by a driver from Black Sands and had a journey of about 90 minutes to the resort.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">The resort is all very nice. There are only seven rooms here and there is only one other couple staying here - Rob and Gillian, also from England and who had arrived on the same flight from Singapore as us. After completing the paperwork we were shown to our room which has excellent views looking out over the Lembeh Straight. We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We had our evening meal at 7:00. The food here looks as if it is going to be very good again. Once we had eaten, we got our dive gear ready for tomorrow and had a much needed early night - all four of us totally worn out from traveling and/or drinking.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th January</span>
            We were up just after 6:00 feeling a lot better after a very good nights sleep. Breakfast was at 7:00 and we were down at the dive centre just before 8:00 for the first dive of the day. The four of us were all diving from the same boat but had a guide per couple. We were guided by Etmo. First dive of the day was at Hairball I which is less than five minutes by boat from the resort. This was also the first dive I had done with my new strobe.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was not great. We saw a nice sea-horse as soon as we got in but did not realise that this was going to be the highlight of the dive. We did  not see a lot else and it was all a bit disappointing.. not helped by the fact that Rob and Gillian saw two frogfish including a hairy one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at Magic Rock was a lot better. This time we saw two frogfish including our first hairy one. (Roz saw another that I managed to miss somehow). There was also another sea-horse that I found and a few coconut octopus so a much more typical Lembeh dive. The boat went out again after lunch but Roz and I decided to dive the house reef on our own. We have a dive package that includes the two morning boat dives and allows us one unguided dive on the house reef. We probably did not see as much as we would have done if we had been guided but it was an enjoyable enough dive of over a hundred minutes and Roz did manage to find another frog-fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was another quiet evening. The meals have been very good so far. You are given the option of a few things from the menu and order your food in advance so lunch and dinner are ordered after breakfast and breakfast ordered after dinner. Every meal has been very good - a lot better than Indonesian food usually is. There are still no other guests at the resort so it was the four of us for dinner again although Bruce was there talking to us most of the time we were eating. Stayed up slightly later than last night but were still relatively early going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 20th January</span>
            Same routine as yesterday. Breakfast at 7:00 and on the boat for the first dive by 8:00. Same groups and guides as yesterday as there are still only four people staying at the resort. First dive a=of the day was at Bianca, a site that we dived last year and one of the few sites dived by Lembeh Dive Lodge and Black Sands. Black Sands is a lot further East and they tend to only dive the near-by sites. Bianca is back towards Lembeh Dive Lodge but still only about a ten minute boat ride.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">Plenty to see on this dive. We went down to about 22m to look at flamboyant cuttle fish eggs. There was a pygmy cuttle fish in the same area. At the top of the reef were mandarin fish and our first little yellow box fish of the trip. The second dive in front of Makawidey Village was OK. We had another good sea-horse and a very brief sighting of a small yellow frogfish as it dashed to hide under a piece of coral, but not too much else of any note. We do not seem to be seeing as much as we saw here last year in my opinion. I don't know if this is down to the guides, the dive sites or there just not being as much around but the decent sightings do not seem as regular as they were a year ago.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, Roz and I had another dive on the house reef. Again, there was not too many of the spectacular sightings here but there was enough to keep us entertained. It is a free dive included in our package so we may as well do it every afternoon. We were unable to find yesterday's frogfish but there were a few other things with a tiny snake eel probably being the highlight. We messed up the navigation a bit coming back in and ended up outside the village about 30m from the resort and had to go back down to swim back. Still a good dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-003.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had decided that we would do a fourth dive today. We wanted to try a night dive while we were here and they go out for night dives at 5:30. The dive was at Retak Larry, a few minutes away and all four of us were on the boat again. After saying earlier that the diving had not been that good so far, this dive was superb and up there with the best night dives we have ever done.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive started off with a tiny red frog fish. We then saw quite a few octopus. We saw four wunderpus (one of which got eaten by a scorpion fish), at least one coconut octopus, and a long arm octopus. We spent about ten minutes looking at these before heading down a bit deeper to look for bobbit worms. We had never seen these wierd looking creatures before but I think this is one of the best sites anywhere in the world to see them. We managed to see two of them as well as lots of file fish, scorpion fish, etc. We saw another coconut octopus on the way back up to finish an excellent dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were not in the restaurant for dinner until gone 7:30 and by the time we had sorted out cameras and looked at the days photos, we did not get to bed until just after 10:30.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st January</span>
            First dive of the day was at Nudi Falls. Still no new guests so the same groups as before. An enjoyable dive with a few things to see although not too many nudis! There seemed to be a lot of juvenile stuff on this site. We saw a very small scorpion fish, a tiny peacock mantis shrimp and a couple of little yellow box fish. Also saw a pygmy squid and five or six larger cuttle fish at the start of the dive. 
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-004.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive number two was at Teluk Kembahu III, a site we had dived last year. We did not see too much for the first part of the dive. There were a few coconut octopus around. We are getting to quite like these but there was not too much else to look at. Etmo kept finding flamboyant cuttle fish eggs which I had been getting a bit bored of. After about 50 minutes or so, he found a set of them where one had just hatched and another was just about to. I am not sure how he knew it was about to hatch but we were able to watch it happen and could watch a couple of tiny new-born flambo's as they started their lives. This event turned an average dive into a very memorable one! I almost managed to get a video of the cuttle fish hatching but after recording 30 seconds of the egg, I stopped about a second before the cuttle fish came out! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on the house reef by 2:45. This time we were able to find the frogfish in both directions and made it back to the resort without getting lost - actually very easy now we are getting to know our way around. Also saw a sea-snake, a mantis shrimp and a couple of decent size nudis.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate with Rob and Gillian again and were back in the room before 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 22nd January</span>
            The first dive of the day was at Serena Island, the site where we saw the blue-ring octopus last year. This was our last dive here for Rob and Gillian as they fly to Sarong early tomorrow morning. The dive was not great again but as with yesterday was saved by flamboyant cuttle fish. We initially saw one on its own and then saw three together - one larger female and two males. After the ones we saw yesterday, the female seemed huge! There were a few nudis around but not too much else to see.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-005.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Had the boat to ourselves for the second dive (and will have for the rest of our stay here apparently). Roz asked if we could see hairy frogfish so we returned to Hairball I where we had missed the two on our first day here. This time we were able to see two of them. The first one was down at about 22m. We were able to spend about 10 - 15 minutes looking at it before having to go shallower although I did go into deco stopping to photograph a sea-horse on the way back up. We had got shallower and my deco had cleared when we went back down to 13m to see the second one. We only spent a couple of minutes with this one (back into deco) before having to go shallower again but it was good to see them. We saw another sea-horse in the shallows and also a Shaun the Sheep nudi. Excellent dive and a site that we will definitely ask to dive again before we leave.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived on our own on the house reef again in the afternoon. We did not go in this time until about 4:15. Another good dive of 110 minutes. We saw our frogfish in both directions and Roz managed to find another bright orange frogfish down at about 13m. Good dive again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening we had our first alcohol since getting to Indonesia. It was Rob and Gillian's last night and we had decided that we would have a drink with them with dinner. As it was, they had been away for most of the day, did not get back until 8ish and disappeared straight after the meal as they leave at 5:30 tomorrow morning. We had a drink while we waited for them to get back and, after saying our goodbyes, returned to the balcony and drank half a litre of our duty free Bacardi. A very enjoyable evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 23rd January</span>
            By the time we got up for breakfast, we were the only ones staying at the resort. We have it to ourselves for the next two nights as there are no other guests arriving until Saturday. The first dive was at Tanjung Kubur on the other side of the Lembeh Straight to where we are staying. The first half of this dive was not great but then Etmo found what must be the smallest frogfish we have ever seen. The frogfish got moved from about 20m to 15m as we were all low on bottom time and this gave us a bit more time for photos. When we left the frogfish we went up to the top of the reef which was all quite nice. We saw a couple of yellow box fish and a tiger shrimp before the end of the dive.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive two was at Aer Baju 1. This was quite an eventful dive! We saw a sea-horse and a tiny juvenile pufferfish right at the start. As seems to be happening quite a lot, we then had about 20 - 30 minutes without a lot happening before Etmo found a mimic octopus. This was superb. We have never seen a mimic before and were able to spend ten minutes or so making it change colour and generally playing with it and taking photos.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This all came to a bit of a sad end (particularly for the octopus) when it was eaten by a flounder. I felt a bit guilty about this as the octopus had been stopped from going into its hole so we could take pictures of it but there was not a lot we could do about it now. We watched the flounder swim away with legs protruding from its mouth and gills and then saw another flounder come over and try and get bits of leg for itself. All quite spectacular to watch if a bit sad from the octopus's point of view. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This all caused both of us to go into deco for the second day running but we had plenty of time coming back up the slope so not a big problem. We saw another couple of sea-horses on the way up as well as the first one again. All in all, another good dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-007.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">All the food has been good here but lunch was excellent today particularly the chocolate mousse. An hour after eating, we were back in the water again  for another 110 minute dive on the house reef. This has been by far the best of the house reefs we have had in this area and there is still plenty to see there without us getting bored of it yet. We went left from the entry point today for the first time and there was quite a lot to see in that area.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We swam back past the dive centre to look for our frogfish again and were surprised to find that he was not where he had been for most of the last week. However, we think we found him again back on the rope marking the entry/exit point as we were ending the dive. The one that Roz found (again) on the rope was the same size and colour as the one we had seen before so we assumed that he had just moved for some reason. Good to see that he is still around!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out by the time we had eaten so were back in the room by 8:00 and asleep about an hour later.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th January</span>
            First dive of the day was at Tanjung Kusu Kusu which was again on the other side of the straight. This was the deepest dive we have done since getting here with a coral reef going down to about 18m and then a sandy bottom sloping down. We went along the bottom to about 27m. A bit of current to start which was not ideal at that depth but a nice enough dive again. On the sandy bottom we saw another flamboyant cuttle fish, peacock mantis shrimps, scorpion fish and a couple of Picachu nudibranchs. The reef was quite nice here as well so once we had run out of bottom time, we could spend half an hour or so looking at more normal fish.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was just along from the dive centre. We were dropped at Teluk Kembahu II and swam along to Teluk Kembahu III (the house reef, right in front of the dive centre is Teluk Kembahu I). This was the best dive of the trip so far and certainly one of the best we have ever done in Lembeh. We saw an orange frogfish almost as soon as we had gone down adn not long after that, we saw the first ornate ghost pipe fish of the trip. Etmo then found another flamboyant cuttle fish that had just hatched. We spent about 30 minutes with it before moving off to make way for another group. We then found a female hairy frogfish with a smaller male very close by. We spent some time with them as they moved together with the male apparently keen on mating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were only in about 12m at this point but still run out of bottom time. As we came up the reef, we had a brief look at a coconut octopus which put Roz and my spare computer into deco meaning a long safety stop. Also saw a second coconut octopus and a Shaun the Sheep nudi before finishing what had become a 105 minute dive.
