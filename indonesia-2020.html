                I finished work at 4:00 and drove back to Basingstoke to collect Roz who had got there from Kingsclere by bus. We had an uneventful drive to Heathrow where the car was collected by someone from a meet and greet service. It took about an hour from when we arrived to get rid of the car, check in our luggage and get through security but by 18:30 we were making our way to the Premium Plaza lounge 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a very enjoyable three hours in the lounge and certainly got our £30's worth in food and drink. We made our way to the plane at 9:30 and took off on time at 22:05 on the Singapore Airlines flight to Changi. We had another couple of hours of drinking on the plane and are not really sure what time we went to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 17th January</span>
                We landed at Changi slightly early at about 18:30 local time. We did not need to collect our luggage as it was checked in all the way to Manado. We left the airport and got the MRT one stop to where we had booked a room at the Park Avenue Hotel for the night. The hotel was chosen as it is only a couple of minutes walk from the MRT station. It is located in some sort of business park which is not ideal but there are a few restaurants around it as well as the inevitable shopping mall. We had quick showers and a couple of drinks in the room before going out to eat at one of the near-by Indian restaurants.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we had a walk round the shopping mall before returning to the room where we drank the litre of duty free Bacardi that we had bought when we arrived at Changi. Got to bed at about 1:30
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 18th January</span>
            We were awake at 7:00 had showers and returned to the airport on the MRT. We had breakfast at McDonalds before boarding the 9:20 Silk Air flight to Manado. The flight was again uneventful (apart from an aborted landing!) and we arrived in Manado just before 1pm. I was feeling quite rough by this time due to two nights of too much alcohol and not enough sleep. We were met at the airport by a driver from Black Sands and had a journey of about 90 minutes to the resort.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">The resort is all very nice. There are only seven rooms here and there is only one other couple staying here - Rob and Gillian, also from England and who had arrived on the same flight from Singapore as us. After completing the paperwork we were shown to our room which has excellent views looking out over the Lembeh Straight. We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We had our evening meal at 7:00. The food here looks as if it is going to be very good again. Once we had eaten, we got our dive gear ready for tomorrow and had a much needed early night - all four of us totally worn out from traveling and/or drinking.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th January</span>
            We were up just after 6:00 feeling a lot better after a very good nights sleep. Breakfast was at 7:00 and we were down at the dive centre just before 8:00 for the first dive of the day. The four of us were all diving from the same boat but had a guide per couple. We were guided by Etmo. First dive of the day was at Hairball I which is less than five minutes by boat from the resort. This was also the first dive I had done with my new strobe.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was not great. We saw a nice sea-horse as soon as we got in but did not realise that this was going to be the highlight of the dive. We did  not see a lot else and it was all a bit disappointing.. not helped by the fact that Rob and Gillian saw two frogfish including a hairy one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at Magic Rock was a lot better. This time we saw two frogfish including our first hairy one. (Roz saw another that I managed to miss somehow). There was also another sea-horse that I found and a few coconut octopus so a much more typical Lembeh dive. The boat went out again after lunch but Roz and I decided to dive the house reef on our own. We have a dive package that includes the two morning boat dives and allows us one unguided dive on the house reef. We probably did not see as much as we would have done if we had been guided but it was an enjoyable enough dive of over a hundred minutes and Roz did manage to find another frog-fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was another quiet evening. The meals have been very good so far. You are given the option of a few things from the menu and order your food in advance so lunch and dinner are ordered after breakfast and breakfast ordered after dinner. Every meal has been very good - a lot better than Indonesian food usually is. There are still no other guests at the resort so it was the four of us for dinner again although Bruce was there talking to us most of the time we were eating. Stayed up slightly later than last night but were still relatively early going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 20th January</span>
            Same routine as yesterday. Breakfast at 7:00 and on the boat for the first dive by 8:00. Same groups and guides as yesterday as there are still only four people staying at the resort. First dive of the day was at Bianca, a site that we dived last year and one of the few sites dived by Lembeh Dive Lodge and Black Sands. Black Sands is a lot further East and they tend to only dive the near-by sites. Bianca is back towards Lembeh Dive Lodge but still only about a ten minute boat ride.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">Plenty to see on this dive. We went down to about 22m to look at flamboyant cuttle fish eggs. There was a pygmy cuttle fish in the same area. At the top of the reef were mandarin fish and our first little yellow box fish of the trip. The second dive in front of Makawidey Village was OK. We had another good sea-horse and a very brief sighting of a small yellow frogfish as it dashed to hide under a piece of coral, but not too much else of any note. We do not seem to be seeing as much as we saw here last year in my opinion. I don't know if this is down to the guides, the dive sites or there just not being as much around but the decent sightings do not seem as regular as they were a year ago.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, Roz and I had another dive on the house reef. Again, there was not too many of the spectacular sightings here but there was enough to keep us entertained. It is a free dive included in our package so we may as well do it every afternoon. We were unable to find yesterday's frogfish but there were a few other things with a tiny snok-flake moray probably being the highlight. We messed up the navigation a bit coming back in and ended up outside the village about 30m from the resort and had to go back down to swim back. Still a good dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-003.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had decided that we would do a fourth dive today. We wanted to try a night dive while we were here and they go out for night dives at 5:30. The dive was at Retak Larry, a few minutes away and all four of us were on the boat again. After saying earlier that the diving had not been that good so far, this dive was superb and up there with the best night dives we have ever done.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive started off with a tiny red frog fish. We then saw quite a few octopus. We saw four wunderpus (one of which got eaten by a scorpion fish), at least one coconut octopus, and a long arm octopus. We spent about ten minutes looking at these before heading down a bit deeper to look for bobbit worms. We had never seen these wierd looking creatures before but I think this is one of the best sites anywhere in the world to see them. We managed to see two of them as well as lots of file fish, scorpion fish, etc. We saw another coconut octopus on the way back up to finish an excellent dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were not in the restaurant for dinner until gone 7:30 and by the time we had sorted out cameras and looked at the days photos, we did not get to bed until just after 10:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st January</span>
            First dive of the day was at Nudi Falls. Still no new guests so the same groups as before. An enjoyable dive with a few things to see although not too many nudis! There seemed to be a lot of juvenile stuff on this site. We saw a very small scorpion fish, a tiny peacock mantis shrimp and a couple of little yellow box fish. Also saw a pygmy squid and five or six larger squid at the start of the dive. 
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-004.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive number two was at Teluk Kembahu III, a site we had dived last year. We did not see too much for the first part of the dive. There were a few coconut octopus around. We are getting to quite like these but there was not too much else to look at. Etmo kept finding flamboyant cuttle fish eggs which I had been getting a bit bored of. After about 50 minutes or so, he found a set of them where one had just hatched and another was just about to. I am not sure how he knew it was about to hatch but we were able to watch it happen and could watch a couple of tiny new-born flambo's as they started their lives. This event turned an average dive into a very memorable one! I almost managed to get a video of the cuttle fish hatching but after recording 30 seconds of the egg, I stopped about a second before the cuttle fish came out! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on the house reef by 2:45. This time we were able to find the frogfish in both directions and made it back to the resort without getting lost - actually very easy now we are getting to know our way around. Also saw a sea-snake, a mantis shrimp and a couple of decent size nudis.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate with Rob and Gillian again and were back in the room before 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 22nd January</span>
            The first dive of the day was at Serena Island, the site where we saw the blue-ring octopus last year. This was our last dive here for Rob and Gillian as they fly to Sarong early tomorrow morning. The dive was not great again but as with yesterday was saved by flamboyant cuttle fish. We initially saw one on its own and then saw three together - one larger female and two males. After the ones we saw yesterday, the female seemed huge! There were a few nudis around but not too much else to see.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-005.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Had the boat to ourselves for the second dive (and will have for the rest of our stay here apparently). Roz asked if we could see hairy frogfish so we returned to Hairball I where we had missed the two on our first day here. This time we were able to see two of them. The first one was down at about 22m. We were able to spend about 10 - 15 minutes looking at it before having to go shallower although I did go into deco stopping to photograph a sea-horse on the way back up. We had got shallower and my deco had cleared when we went back down to 13m to see the second one. We only spent a couple of minutes with this one (back into deco) before having to go shallower again but it was good to see them. We saw another sea-horse in the shallows and also a Shaun the Sheep nudi. Excellent dive and a site that we will definitely ask to dive again before we leave.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived on our own on the house reef again in the afternoon. We did not go in this time until about 4:15. Another good dive of 110 minutes. We saw our frogfish in both directions and Roz managed to find another bright orange frogfish down at about 13m. Good dive again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening we had our first alcohol since getting to Indonesia. It was Rob and Gillian's last night and we had decided that we would have a drink with them with dinner. As it was, they had been away for most of the day, did not get back until 8ish and disappeared straight after the meal as they leave at 5:30 tomorrow morning. We had a drink while we waited for them to get back and, after saying our goodbyes, returned to the balcony and drank half a litre of our duty free Bacardi. A very enjoyable evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 23rd January</span>
            By the time we got up for breakfast, we were the only ones staying at the resort. We have it to ourselves for the next two nights as there are no other guests arriving until Saturday. The first dive was at Tanjung Kubur on the other side of the Lembeh Straight to where we are staying. The first half of this dive was not great but then Etmo found what must be the smallest frogfish we have ever seen. The frogfish got moved from about 20m to 15m as we were all low on bottom time and this gave us a bit more time for photos. When we left the frogfish we went up to the top of the reef which was all quite nice. We saw a couple of yellow box fish and a tiger shrimp before the end of the dive.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive two was at Aer Baju 1. This was quite an eventful dive! We saw a sea-horse and a tiny juvenile pufferfish right at the start. As seems to be happening quite a lot, we then had about 20 - 30 minutes without a lot happening before Etmo found a mimic octopus. This was superb. We think we have only ever seen one mimic before and were able to spend ten minutes or so making it change colour and generally playing with it and taking photos.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This all came to a bit of a sad end (particularly for the octopus) when it was eaten by a flounder. I felt a bit guilty about this as the octopus had been stopped from going into its hole so we could take pictures of it but there was not a lot we could do about it by the time it was eaten. We watched the flounder swim away with legs protruding from its mouth and gills and then saw another flounder come over and try and get bits of leg for itself. All quite spectacular to watch if a bit sad from the octopus's point of view. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This all caused both of us to go into deco for the second day running but we had plenty of time coming back up the slope so not a big problem. We saw another couple of sea-horses on the way up as well as the first one again. All in all, another good dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-007.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">All the food has been good here but lunch was excellent today particularly the chocolate mousse. An hour after eating, we were back in the water again  for another 110 minute dive on the house reef. This has been by far the best of the house reefs we have had in this area and there is still plenty to see there without us getting bored of it yet. We went left from the entry point today for the first time and there was quite a lot to see in that area.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We swam back past the dive centre to look for our frogfish again and were surprised to find that he was not where he had been for most of the last week. However, we think we found him again back on the rope marking the entry/exit point as we were ending the dive. The one that Roz found (again) on the rope was the same size and colour as the one we had seen before so we assumed that he had just moved for some reason. Good to see that he is still around!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out by the time we had eaten so were back in the room by 8:00 and asleep about an hour later.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th January</span>
            First dive of the day was at Tanjung Kusu Kusu which was again on the other side of the straight. This was the deepest dive we have done since getting here with a coral reef going down to about 18m and then a sandy bottom sloping down. We went along the bottom to about 27m. A bit of current to start which was not ideal at that depth but a nice enough dive again. On the sandy bottom we saw another flamboyant cuttle fish, peacock mantis shrimps, scorpion fish and a couple of Picachu nudibranchs. The reef was quite nice here as well so once we had run out of bottom time, we could spend half an hour or so looking at more normal fish.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was just along from the dive centre. We were dropped at Teluk Kembahu II and swam along to Teluk Kembahu III (the house reef, right in front of the dive centre is Teluk Kembahu I). This was the best dive of the trip so far and certainly one of the best we have ever done in Lembeh. We saw an orange frogfish almost as soon as we had gone down and not long after that, we saw the first ornate ghost pipe fish of the trip. Etmo then found another flamboyant cuttle fish that had just hatched. We spent about 30 minutes with it before moving off to make way for another group. We then found a female hairy frogfish with a smaller male very close by. We spent some time with them as they moved together with the male apparently keen on mating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were only in about 12m at this point but still run out of bottom time. As we came up the reef, we had a brief look at a coconut octopus which put Roz and my spare computer into deco meaning a long safety stop. Also saw a second coconut octopus and a Shaun the Sheep nudi before finishing what had become a 105 minute dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz's camera broke towards the end of the dive. It came up with the same Lens Error that we had on the previous S100 and have also seen on other Canon cameras. It generally means the camera is dead as Canon no longer repair them. She was already on her second housing of the trip as earlier in the week, her old housing started letting in drops of water. Fortunately, she had back-ups for both housing and camera that were bought second hand on eBay so as long as nothing else breaks, she can carry on taking photos.
			</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did our afternoon dive slightly later again today. We went left again but did the whole dive on this side instead of splitting it like we did yesterday. The frogfish had moved from the line tonight but was replaced by a couple of sea-horses. We saw one on the line on the way out and there was a second one there by the time we made our way back in. Nothing particularly notable for the rest of the dive but another enjoyable 105 minutes underwater.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
			We ate on our own again as there are still no other guests here. Good food again followed by a couple of drinks on the balcony and another early night.
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 25th January</span>
            First dive of the day was at Serena Kapoot and was not great. Etmo was looking for boxer crabs and harlequin shrimps but did not find either. We did see a sea-horse and a couple of yellow box fish but not too much else of any interest.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">As with yesterday, the second dive was much better than the first. We dived at Teluk Kembahu III so a lot of it was the same area as yesterdays second dive. We saw more newly hatched flamboyant cuttle fish and this time I managed to video one coming out of the egg. Unfortunately this one got eaten a few seconds later but there was a second that we could spend more time looking at.
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">We saw another very small yellow frog-fish. It was quite a bit bigger than the one two days ago but was very cute nonetheless. We also saw a robust ghost pipe fish and a pair of Ambon scorpion fish, something I don't think we have ever seen before. These looked like a cross between a rhinopia and a hairy frogfish and were superb looking animals.
            </p>
			<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-009.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Another very good dive on the house reef after lunch. We saw a sea-horse as we went out along the line. The frog fish was not on the line but we swam along to the place where we had originally seen him and he was back there along with a bigger female frog-fish. The female was an incredibly ugly looking specimen and seeing the two of them together was excellent. We spent about twenty minutes watching the two of them before moving on and then returned to see them on the way back again. This turned into our longest dive here - 111 minutes.
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">We had just over an hour surface interval before going out on a night dive at Hairball I. Bruce, the owner of the resort joined us and it was another very good night dive. The highlight was the two hairy frog-fish but there were  plenty of octopus around again. There were two really good long arm octopus which we were able to watch for a while and thankfully, neither of them got eaten!
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">Tonight was our last night at the resort. Another couple had arrived this afternoon but they had finished eating by the time we got to the restaurant so did not talk to them. Bruce talked to us while we ate (he talks a lot!) and we then returned to the balcony for a few rum and cokes before going to bed at about 11:30. Did not manage to stay up for the football results.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 26th January</span>
            Another unspectacular dive to start the day, this time at Magic Rock. We started off by going down to 27m looking for pygmy sea-horses. Neither of us are that bothered about looking for pygmy sea-horses so We probably should have suggested going to a different site but we went along with it. The search was unsuccessful and when we went back up the sand, there was not a lot else to see. There was quite a bit of current meaning that there was not much of the usual Lembeh stuff about. We did see a sea-horse and a couple of small octopus but not a great dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive and the last of this visit to Lembeh was at Hairball I and was a lot better. We were joined on the boat by Bruce again. The main reason for diving this site is for the hairy frog-fish and we saw three on this dive. We went down to about 20m where there were two small ones very close together. We stayed with them until we had run out of bottom time and then saw one of the ones we had seen last night on the way up. We spent quite a bit of time in the shallows where there were four or five sea-horses and a few other weird looking scorpion fish, etc so despite the first dive not being great, we finished our diving here on a high point.
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">We washed our dive gear and hung it up to briefly dry while we returned to the room for showers and to pack the rest of our stuff. We had decided not to stay at the resort for lunch so checked out as soon as we were ready, collected our still wet dive gear and left at about 1:45.
            </p>
			<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-010.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The journey to Murex near Manado took just under two hours including a stop to be crisps and biscuits for lunch. Not much appeared to have changed at Murex and we were given the same room that we were in almost exactly a year ago. We had a quick look around the resort, hung up our dive gear before returning to the room to unpack. We had our resort briefing with Linda at 5pm She spent about half an hour telling us that nothing had really changed since last year. We booked ourselves onto tomorrows trip to Bunakan.
            </p>
			<p class="diary-text">We did not do a lot else until dinner time at 7:00. The resort is not full but there were a few other people around. Dinner is a self service buffet with communal tables. We ate with Greg and Sally (from Australia but living in Singapore) and were later joined by Helen (from England) and Rachel (Chinese but working in Manado). As with the last time we were here, the food was very good particularly the fish. A night off alcohol tonight!

            Bad start to the day as my laptop seems to have died. It has been on its last legs for a while and needs replacing but it would not boot up at all this morning.
			</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-011.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">A slightly different schedule to Lembeh here. After breakfast, the boat goes across to Bunaken for two dives with the hour surface interval spent on the boat. There was only us and Helen on the boat today and we were all led by Anto who we dived with last year. Two very enjoyable dives. We are diving here because we want to see turtles. The two dives today were both wall dives, the first at Bunakan Timur, the second at Lekuan I. We were not too optimistic about the first site but knew that Lekuan I was one of the best sites anywhere for consistently spotting turtles. As it was, we saw 18 on the first dive which was a bonus and 35 on the second a similar amount to what we were seeing there last year.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, I managed to get the laptop back to life. How long for I do not know but it is up and running again. It just needs to survive another six days!
			</p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 2:45, we went out on the house reef on our own. It was not totally clear whether or not we were supposed to do this on our own as you are supposed to be accompanied by a guide the first time you dive there. However, we had dived it a few times last year and anyway, a few rules seem to have been relaxed a bit since the Scottish instructor was replaced by a local a few months after we were here. The house reef here is never going to be as good as the one in Lembeh but it was an enjoyable enough 90 minute dive with a few interesting things to see including flying gurnards, a nice school of batfish and yellow box fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the evening. Murex sells reasonable German wheat beer for not much more than Bintang so we started with a beer (and a glass of wine for Roz) on the balcony. We ate on our own as Greg and Sally were not back from their day tour and Helen was doing a night dive. We joined them at their table when they had all returned and stayed there until just after 9:00. We had a couple more drinks in the room while looking at the days pictures and got to bed at around 10:30.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 28th January</span>
            Woke up to find that we have been successful in our application for Euro 2020 tickets. A better start to the day than yesterday!!
			</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-012.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The boat was a bit more crowded today. As well as us and Helen, we had Mia in our group for the first dive. Greg and Sally were snorkeling and also on the boat were Kevin, Tina and Olivia from China - parents diving, eight year old child stayed on boat. The dives were both excellent again. The first dive was at Fukui, a site that I was not that impressed with last year. It was a better dive today. Not long after we had gone down, we had a brief sighting of a mola mola. Roz and I were at the back of the group and could only just about make out the shape of it. Helen, Mia and Anto were closer and were able to make out two of them. The rest of the site was very nice and we saw another eleven turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Lekuan II and was one of the best we have done here. The wall here is spectacular and was covered in schools of pyramid butterfly fish and red tooth trigger fish. We saw a couple of juvenile white-tips in a cave at the start and also a pygmy sea-horse. As well as all this, Roz counted 43 turtles, more than we have ever seen on a single dive at Bunaken. When we were here a year ago, the numbers of turtles had gone up dramatically since our previous visit. They seem to have gone up again in the last twelve months!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, Roz went to the pool and I had an hour in the room before the third dive of the day on the house reef at 3:00. It was another good dive. I think we would get bored of it after a while but for four or five days, there is enough there to keep us amused. Highlights this afternoon were the school of bat fish, a couple of little yellow box fish that were reasonably happy to be photographed and some very nice anemones with clown fish in them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent the evening with most of the people that were on the boat today. We ate with the Chinese family and were then joined by Helen, Greg and Sally who had been night diving/snorkeling. An alcohol free night and we were back in the room just after 9:00.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 29th January</span>
            We said our goodbyes to Greg and Sally after breakfast as they fly back to Singapore this morning. This meant that it was just us, Helen and Mia on the boat today with Anto guiding again. First dive was at Mandolin. This is a site where mola molas can be spotted and after seeing them yesterday it seemed a good option. Another spectacular wall dive with plenty of fish and an unexpectedly high number of turtles - Roz counted 26 despite being told by Anto that there were not very many here! No mola molas but still an excellent dive.
			</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were going to do the second dive at Muka Kampung but the current looked horrendous so "unfortunately" we had  go back and dive Lekuan II again. This was every bit as good as the dive here yesterday with another 42 turtles including five hawksbills.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, we said goodbye to Helen who also left today - she is heading off to Banka for a few days before flying home. We dived the house reef again after she had departed. We could not find the box fish today so it was the bat fish that provided the highlight of the dive. There is a small school of about ten juveniles that live at the front of a small boat in about 10m. They seem to have got used to us and have become very friendly. Did not see too much else of any note on the dive. Still enjoying this dive site but by the time we have done it for the fourth time tomorrow, I think we will have done it enough!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There were not too many people left at the resort by this evening. We ate with the Chinese family that were on the dive boat yesterday but the five of us were the only ones eating. We had a few drinks before, during and after the meal but were in bed before 11:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 30th January</span>
            Just us and Mia on the boat this morning. We had a new guide, Mario, as Anton needed a rest after four dives a day with Helen. As we were the only customers (Mia is not a customer but is related to the owners and is doing some sort of internship here) we got to choose the dive sites so went to Lekuan II and Lekuan I. From the first time we dived at Bunaken, 13 years ago, these sites have been the ones with the most turtles.
			</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-014.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Both dives were very good again. On the first, we saw a couple of bump-heads, and two Napoleon wrasse.... as well as 34 turtles. The second, our 500th in Indonesia, was another new record for Bunaken with a total of 58 turtles. An excellent morning's diving!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We said goodbye to the Chinese family after lunch. We think there is now only one other couple staying at the resort and they do not seem to be diving and do not eat in the restaurant so once again, we have just about a whole resort to ourselves. We went out on the house reef for a final time at about 2:45 again. Another enjoyable 90 minute dive. The batfish were very friendly again and we spent about 10 minutes with them before moving on. We managed to find the two yellow box fish again, I spotted a juvenile angel fish and we found a giant moray that we had not seen before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were not totally on our own for dinner. We were joined by Connor, an American who is currently volunteering at Murex in Banka and is over here for a couple of days. It was an alcohol free night so we were back in the room by 8:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 31st January</span>
            The last two dives of this holiday this morning. We had the first heavy rain we have seen so far just after breakfast. It was torrential as we got on the boat but eased when we left and had stopped by the time we reached Bunaken. There were three Germans on the boat with us - two divers and one snorkeler. We were diving on our own with Mario again. The first site was Sachiko's Point at the back of the island. This is a nice enough site but there are no-where near as many turtles here as at other parts of Bunaken so a bit frustrating but we still saw six including some quality hawksbills.
			</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/indonesia/ind-015.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was supposed to be at Lekuan I but there was a change of plan due to strong current again. We dived at Jalan Musak instead which is slightly further West than the Lekuan sites. This was a very good dive. It is a simililar site to Lekuan and we saw another 28 turtles bring the total for ten dives at Bunaken to 301. This is a significant improvement on last year when we saw on average 17 turtles per dive there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the dive resort, we washed our gear and hung it up to dry. Although the rain had stopped, there was not too much sun around which was not ideal but there was not a lot we could do about it. We did not have a lot to do for the rest of the afternoon. We probably could have dived the house reef again but we fly tomorrow at about 14:00 and we have done a lot of diving without a break in the last two weeks. Giving ourselves 24 hours from the last dive seemed a better idea. We wandered out to the shop but apart from that stayed in the resort lying by the pool or starting to pack.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks while watching the sunset before eating. Again, it was only us and Conner in the restaurant but an enjoyable enough evening with a few more beers. We returned to the room to look at photos from the last couple of days while finishing the end of our duty free Bacardi and the wine that Roz had bought from home. Fortunately, there was not too much of either left so it was still a relatively early night
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 1st February</span>
            A lie in this morning for the first time in two weeks as we did not go to breakfast until 8:00. We then had a couple of hours to kill before heading off to the airport at 11:00 for our flight back to Singapore.
