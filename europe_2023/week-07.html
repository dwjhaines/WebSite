          A very easy morning of cycling today. The weather forecast was not great with plenty of rain predicted. It was not raining when we finished breakfast so we packed our things and left Inzell by 8:45. As it was, it started raining as we left but it was not heavy and it was quite a nice temperature for cycling. The path today was surfaced all the way and had fewer hills than yesterday. We were close to the river apart from the last couple of miles and we made it into the main square of Linz before midday.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Our apartment for tonight was only a couple of minutes away from the square. It was not ready when we got there but we were able to lock up our bikes in the courtyard and leave our luggage in the apartment. The cleaners told us to come back in 30 minutes and it would be ready. We walked back to the centre, found a supermarket and bought stuff for lunch. By the time we were back it was ready. All quite nice again with plenty of space and a slightly better equipped kitchen than the ones in Georgia.
