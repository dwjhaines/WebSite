          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 13th July - Inzell to Linz - 33.1 miles - 220 ft</span>
          A very easy morning of cycling today. The weather forecast was not great with plenty of rain predicted. It was not raining when we finished breakfast so we packed our things and left Inzell by 8:45. As it was, it started raining as we left but it was not heavy and it was quite a nice temperature for cycling. The path today was surfaced all the way and had fewer hills than yesterday. We were close to the river apart from the last couple of miles and we made it into the main square of Linz before midday.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          Our apartment for tonight was only a couple of minutes away from the square. It was not ready when we got there but we were able to lock up our bikes in the courtyard and leave our luggage in the apartment. The cleaners told us to come back in 30 minutes and it would be ready. We walked back to the centre, found a supermarket and bought stuff for lunch. By the time we were back it was ready. All quite nice again with plenty of space and a slightly better equipped kitchen than the ones in Georgia.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again to see the sights of Linz at 3:30. We walked up to the Schloss which has been modernised inside and was nothing special. We walked from there to the new cathedral - Linzer Mariendom. Unfortunately the Dom Platz had been taken over by seating for a concert so we could not get there but we were able to walk round the back of the cathedral and get inside. The inside was quite impressive and worth looking around.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The only other vaguely interesting "sight" was the Pöstlingbergbahn, a 2.5 mile tram ride up to the top of Pöstlingberg. <i>The Pöstlingbergbahn is one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. There are steeper grades on at least one other tram system, that of Lisbon, but the Pöstlingbergbahn is still among the world's steepest adhesion railways and has the steepest grade of any in Austria.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Apart from the boring facts, the tram took us up a 539m hill with more spectacular views and a church which was surprisingly good on the inside. After looking at the views and wandering round the church, we had a beer in a beer garden and then got the tram back down again. After a bit of dithering about where to eat, we decided on Linzer Heuriger which is only about 30m from where we are staying. It was full when we got there but we were told we could try again in an hour and a half.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went back to the apartment for a couple of drinks. Roz went and got a litre of wine from Lidl and I had the two bottles of beer that I had bought from the monastery yesterday. We returned to the restaurant at 8:30 by which time the kitchen had closed. Instead we tried Leberkas-Pepi. This was a fast food type place that only sold a wide range of leberkäse (or meatloaf). We both had slices of chili leberkäse in a bread roll accompanied by a beer each and really enjoyed it. We returned to the apartment after eating and finished the wine.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 14th July - Linz to Grein -  38.4 miles - 263 ft</span>
          A tougher day today. It was only five miles further but there was a slight headwind and it was a lot hotter. We left Linz at 10:10 and crossed straight over to the cycle path on the left bank. It was all quite nice for the first few miles out of Linz but then we passed a large industrial area on the other side which was not so scenic. After a few miles we came away from the river and went through a couple of towns but after a while we came back to it and the scenery returned to normal. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a section of about 15 miles where there was no protection from the sun or the wind and no-where to stop and sit in the shade. Although the wind was not strong, it did make it slightly harder work and the heat certainly did not help. After about 27 miles we came to Mitterkirchen where there was a sort of bike service station. We were finally able to sit in the shade and have a cold drink. We also had lunch which we had bought with us from Linz.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After food and drinks, the last ten miles were not as bad. We arrived in Grein just before 3 and checked into Pension Martha in the centre. Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon although I did go out for a short walk while Roz watched Wimbledon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 5:30. We walked around the town which is all quite pleasant. We tried to go up to the castle but it was closed for a wedding so went back down and had a couple of drinks in the main square instead. We went to a pizza restaurant to eat and had very good pizzas with a litre of wine and a couple more beers.

        <p class="diary-text">
          When we got back to the hotel, we felt obliged to try the self service bar. They have beer in a vending machine and you help yourself to wine and tell them what you had in the morning. We just had one bottle of each and returned to the room to drink them. A good night!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 15th July - Grein to Pöchlarn - 24.6 miles - 230 ft</span>
          We left the hotel after breakfast just after 10:00. The first five or six miles were not great as we were spending a lot of time on what was a reasonably busy road. We were still by the river and it was all quite scenic but the traffic did not really add anything to the experience. Things did get better after this. We were still by the road for a while but were at least on a cycle path.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We crossed the river at the power plant at Ybbs and continued to Pöchlarn on the right bank. This was more scenic and traffic free so more enjoyable. The cycling was quite hard work again today. Although we did not go that far, this was the hottest day of the trip with temperatures supposed to be reaching 35°c this afternoon. Last nights alcohol probably did not help but I was totally worn out by the time we got to Hotel Moser just after 1pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had showers and walked to the supermarket to buy lunch. Neither of us could be bothered to walk down to the river to find a scenic spot to eat it so we returned to the room instead. I had thought about cycling to Melk and back this afternoon but the heat made doing anything difficult. I opted for an afternoon nap while Roz watched Wimbledon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We decided that we would join the video call tonight which meant going out to buy provisions. It is difficult to buy cold bottles of wine from supermarkets here and we do not have a fridge so we made two shopping trips. We cycled to a supermarket, bought a couple of litres of wine, a couple of beers and some food and then cycled out to a petrol station to buy a bag of ice. We managed to get it back to the room before it had completely melted and put the whole lot in the sink in our bathroom.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After more showers, we went down to the hotel's beer garden for a couple of drinks while the wine cooled in the sink - it was still too hot to contemplate walking any further. We joined the call just after 8 and spent a few hours chatting while getting through the wine and beer.

          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 16th July - Pöchlarn to Krems - 30.3 miles - 506 ft</span>
          We were on our way by 9:30. Thankfully, it was a few degrees cooler today with quite a bit of cloud cover and we were keen to get going before it started getting hot again. We crossed the river just outside Pöchlarn and continued on the left bank past Melk and on to Krems. This is one of the most scenic parts of the Danube and a section that we have cycled a few times before. Not only is the scenery good along here but the route passes through several picturesque towns and villages.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got to Krems just after 1pm, not quite as worn out as we had been yesterday. We cycled slightly out of the old town to Zum goldenen Engel and checked into the room we had booked for the night. After showers, we had a walk back through the old town where this year's apricot festival was in full swing. We bought food and drink from a bakery and returned to the hotel for lunch.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were back in the room in time for Roz to start watching the men's final from Wimbledon. I did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon until going out for a walk just after 6. I went for a wander round the town again and also along the road to Stein. When I decided that I had done enough steps for the day, I went and sat in Hofbräu am Steinertor, an excellent beer garden that we first visited when we stayed in Krems in 2004. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I had a litre of beer while waiting for Roz who joined me as the match was coming to an end. We had a few more drinks and a couple of very good meals. We walked back to the hotel when the place closed at 10pm.

          <span class="diary-date">Monday 17th July - Krems to Altenberg - 37.8 miles - 142 ft</span>
          We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel before setting off on Day 6 of our trip down the Danube. Once again, it was quite cloudy when we set off and although it was still hot, was no-where near as hot as a couple of days ago. We had cycled about three miles before we were out of Krems and on the other side of the river but after that, it was another very easy ride with hardly any hills. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were beside quite a busy road when we left Krems but after a few miles, it was much quieter and most of the journey was beside the river which seemed incredibly wide on this section. We arrived in Altenberg just after 1 and checked into Gasthof Schwarzer Adler. Not quite as nice as the last few places we have stayed but fine for a night. Altenberg is another small village with not a lot in it. We put our stuff in the room and went out on our bikes to a supermarket a couple of miles away. We bought food for lunch and returned to eat it sat outside our room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Although the temperature has dropped a bit, it was still very hot today. We are not officially suffering from the heatwave that is hitting Southern Europe, but we are definitely being impacted by it. None of the rooms we have been in since leaving Passau have had air-conditioning and the one here has the sun on it all afternoon meaning it is the warmest one we have stayed in so far. It is just about impossible to stay in the room while the sun is still out. In retrospect, we probably should not have bothered stopping here. We could easily have made it all the way into Vienna today where we would have had more things to do..... and an air-conditioned room. However, when we planned the trip we had no idea that it would be this hot and it had seemed like a good idea. We had a very lazy afternoon without doing a lot.

        <p class="diary-text">
          In the evening, we ate in the hotel's restaurant (there were not too many other options in the area). Quite good meals again with a couple of drinks. We had another drink in the garden when the bar closed.... and another when the bar reopened again for us. When we went back to the room, we tried the nut liqueur that we had bought from the monastery but were still in bed not long after 10.

          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 18th July - Altenberg to Vienna-  25.3 miles - 223 ft</span>
          The final leg! We checked out at 8:15 and were on our way five minutes later. In theory, we were less than ten miles from Vienna but we wanted to make it a slightly longer ride and we had been advised by someone we met yesterday to cross the river and enter the city via the long thin island that sits in the middle of the river.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          This worked out to be quite a good move. The island was traffic free and had very good cycle paths so was a lot better than what you usually have to go through when entering a big city. We stayed on the island slightly past the centre and  then crossed the river and had a look round the Ernst Happel Stadium where we will be seeing Springsteen tonight. We could not pick up tickets until 2pm so after a quick look round, we cycled the last three and a half miles through the centre to the Ibis Wien City. After putting our bikes in the underground garage, we had a wait of about five minutes until a room was ready and they let us check in just before midday.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again just after 1. We walked to Pilgrammgasse U-Bahn station, bought 24 hour transport tickets and got the U-Bahn back to the stadium. Crowds were already starting to build up but the queues at the ticket collection point were not that long and by 2pm, we had our tickets. I had thought about buying a tour t-shirt but when I saw that they were €50 each, decided not to bother!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got the U-Bahn back to Schwedenplatz and went for a bit of a walk round the area we have stayed in a few times before. We found Kraw Kraw, the bar where we first met Steve in 2002. They had quite good food prices so we had our first beer of the day with a couple of schnitzels. The pub next door - Bermuda Bräu - had a happy hour from 3:30 to 5:30 where beer was €3 for half a litre and white wine spritzers were €2. We had three rounds in there before getting the U-Bahn back to the stadium.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were in the ground just after 6. We had bought tickets in "Front of Stage 2" meaning that we were not right at the front but in a separate section just in front of the main standing section. This meant that we had an excellent view. We were not too far from the stage and the area round us was not that crowded.

          This was definitely one of the best Springsteen concerts we have been to. Not only did we have a good view, the atmosphere was a lot better than the last time we saw him, with the exception of one or two tracks the set-list was good and the whole show was excellent.

          The organisation inside and outside the stadium was all pretty good as well. We had to queue for about 10 minutes to get back into the U-Bahn station but we were back near our hotel before 11. We went for a few drinks in Beaver Brewing Company, a craft beer bar just about next to the hotel, had another drink in the hotel bar and got to bed at around 1.

          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 19th July</span>
          Did not do a lot all morning apart from a couple of trips out to the supermarket for breakfast and cold drinks. We went out for the day at 12:00. We still had an hour or so left on our transport ticket so we got the U-Bahn to Karlsplatz to begin our sight-seeing.

          There was nothing that we particularly wanted to see apart from wandering round looking at the buildings. We started with Karlskirche before crossing over to the Opera House. We walked through the Burggarten and had a look round the Hofburg. From there we went over the road to Maria-Theresien-Platz before making our way past the Parliament buildings and the Rathaus. We then went into the city centre where we had lunch and ended our tour at St Stephen's Cathedral.

          By the time we had finished, it was getting towards 3pm.... so time to start drinking again! We had one drink in a cellar type place that we had not been to before and then went back to Bermuda Bräu for their happy hour which was very good value. When that came to an end, we had a 30 minute walk to 7 Stern Bräu where we had a few more drinks and an excellent plate of ribs. We had a couple more drinks in Känguru before walking back to the hotel. We managed to avoid drinking too much and were back in bed just after 10.
