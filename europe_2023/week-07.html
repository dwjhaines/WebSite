          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 13th July - Inzell to Linz - 33.1 miles - 220 ft</span>
          A very easy morning of cycling today. The weather forecast was not great with plenty of rain predicted. It was not raining when we finished breakfast so we packed our things and left Inzell by 8:45. As it was, it started raining as we left but it was not heavy and it was quite a nice temperature for cycling. The path today was surfaced all the way and had fewer hills than yesterday. We were close to the river apart from the last couple of miles and we made it into the main square of Linz before midday.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Our apartment for tonight was only a couple of minutes away from the square. It was not ready when we got there but we were able to lock up our bikes in the courtyard and leave our luggage in the apartment. The cleaners told us to come back in 30 minutes and it would be ready. We walked back to the centre, found a supermarket and bought stuff for lunch. By the time we were back it was ready. All quite nice again with plenty of space and a slightly better equipped kitchen than the ones in Georgia.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again to see the sights of Linz at 3:30. We walked up to the Schloss which has been modernised inside and was nothing special. We walked from there to the new cathedral - Linzer Mariendom. Unfortunately the Dom Platz had been taken over by seating for a concert so we could not get there but we were able to walk round the back of the cathedral and get inside. The inside was quite impressive and worth looking around.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The only other vaguely interesting "sight" was the Pöstlingbergbahn, a 2.5 mile tram ride up to the top of Pöstlingberg. <i>The Pöstlingbergbahn is one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. There are steeper grades on at least one other tram system, that of Lisbon, but the Pöstlingbergbahn is still among the world's steepest adhesion railways and has the steepest grade of any in Austria.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Apart from the boring facts, the tram took us up a 539m hill with more spectacular views and a church which was surprisingly good on the inside. After looking at the views and wandering round the church, we had a beer in a beer garden and then got the tram back down again. After a bit of dithering about where to eat, we decided on Linzer Heuriger which is only about 30m from where we are staying. It was full when we got there but we were told we could try again in an hour and a half.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went back to the apartment for a couple of drinks. Roz went and got a litre of wine from Lidl and I had the two bottles of beer that I had bought from the monastery yesterday. We returned to the restaurant at 8:30 by which time the kitchen had closed. Instead we tried Leberkas-Pepi. This was a fast food type place that only sold a wide range of leberkäse (or meatloaf). We both had slices of chili leberkäse in a bread roll accompanied by a beer each and really enjoyed it. We returned to the apartment after eating and finished the wine.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 14th July - Linz to Grein -  38.4 miles - 263 ft</span>
          A tougher day today. It was only five miles further but there was a slight headwind and it was a lot hotter. We left Linz at 10:10 and crossed straight over to the cycle path on the left bank. It was all quite nice for the first few miles out of Linz but then we passed a large industrial area on the other side which was not so scenic. After a few miles we came away from the river and went through a couple of towns but after a while we came back to it and the scenery returned to normal. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a section of about 15 miles where there was no protection from the sun or the wind and no-where to stop and sit in the shade. Although the wind was not strong, it did make it slightly harder work and the heat certainly did not help. After about 27 miles we came to Mitterkirchen where there was a sort of bike service station. We were finally able to sit in the shade and have a cold drink. We also had lunch which we had bought with us from Linz.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After food and drinks, the last ten miles were not as bad. We arrived in Grein just before 3 and checked into Pension Martha in the centre. Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon although I did go out for a short walk while Roz watched Wimbledon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 5:30. We walked around the town which is all quite pleasant. We tried to go up to the castle but it was closed for a wedding so went back down and had a couple of drinks in the main square instead. We went to a pizza restaurant to eat and had very good pizzas with a litre of wine and a couple more beers.

          When we got back to the hotel, we felt obliged to try the self service bar. They have beer in a vending machine and you help yourself to wine and tell them what you had in the morning. We just had one bottle of each and returned to the room to drink them. A good night!
        </p>

          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 15th July - Grein to Pöchlarn - 24.6 miles - 230 ft</span>
          We left the hotel after breakfast just after 10:00. The first five or six miles were not great as we were spending a lot of time on what was a reasonably busy road. We were still by the river and it was all quite scenic but the traffic did not really add anything to the experience. Things did get better after this. We were still by the road for a while but were at least on a cycle path.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We crossed the river at the power plant at Ybbs and continued to Pöchlarn on the right bank. This was more scenic and traffic free so more enjoyable. The cycling was quite hard work again today. Although we did not go that far, this was the hottest day of the trip with temperatures supposed to be reaching 35°c this afternoon. Last nights alcohol probably did not help but I was totally worn out by the time we got to Hotel Moser just after 1pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had showers and walked to the supermarket to buy lunch. Neither of us could be bothered to walk down to the river to find a scenic spot to eat it so we returned to the room instead. I had thought about cycling to Melk and back this afternoon but the heat made doing anything difficult. I opted for an afternoon nap while Roz watched Wimbledon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We decided that we would join the video call tonight which meant going out to buy provisions. It is difficult to buy cold bottles of wine from supermarkets here and we do not have a fridge so we made two shopping trips. We cycled to a supermarket, bought a couple of litres of wine, a couple of beers and some food and then cycled out to a petrol station to buy a bag of ice. We managed to get it back to the room before it had completely melted and put the whole lot in the sink in our bathroom.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After more showers, we went down to the hotel's beer garden for a couple of drinks while the wine cooled in the sink - it was still too hot to contemplate walking any further. We joined the call just after 8 and spent a few hours chatting while getting through the wine and beer.

          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 16th July - Pöchlarn to Krems - 30.3 miles - 506 ft</span>
          We were on our way by 9:30. Thankfully, it was a few degrees cooler today with quite a bit of cloud cover and we were keen to get going before it started getting hot again. We crossed the river just outside Pöchlarn and continued on the left bank past Melk and on to Krems. This is one of the most scenic parts of the Danube and a section that we have cycled a few times before. Not only is the scenery good along here but the route passes through several picturesque towns and villages.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We got to Krems just after 1pm, not quite as worn out as we had been yesterday. We cycled slightly out of the old town to Zum goldenen Engel and checked into the room we had booked for the night. After showers, we had a walk back through the old town where this year's apricot festival was in full swing. We bought food and drink from a bakery and returned to the hotel for lunch.
