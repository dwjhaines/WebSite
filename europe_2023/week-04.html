          We were awake by 6:30, got straight up and checked out of the hotel 15 minutes later. We walked back to Liberty Square and got the metro to the central station. We bought provisions for breakfast and the rest of the journey and went into the station. We got there just as boarding had started so went to the platform and got on the train to Batumi. The train was crowded but more modern than expected and quite comfortable. It left exactly on time at 8:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As the train is mainly serving three Black Sea Coast resorts, it was full of people going on holidays. Despite the abundance of children and the lack of power points it was a pleasant enough journey. As with all our previous trains in Russia and Ukraine, this one arrived exactly on time at 13:12. It was all a bit chaotic outside the station so we abandoned the idea of getting a minibus into town and used the Bolt app to order a taxi. This turned up after about five minutes and five minutes later we were at Hotel N16 where we have a room booked  for the next three nights.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We left the hotel at 3 and had a similar plan to yesterday. The ground is about two miles from where we are staying and we decided to walk there and stop for food/drinks on the way. Once again there are a few craft beer bars in the area. We started at Bevri Pub the nearest one to our hotel. This had a good range of beers but was a bit small meaning we had to sit at the bar. The 7% NE IPA was a good way to start the days drinking. We then found a restaurant that seemed to specialise in Khachapuri, one of the Georgian specialties that we had yet to try. We shared one of these for lunch with another beer.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The next couple of craft beer pubs on my list did not open until 5 so we ended up getting to the ground a bit earlier than expected. There were a couple of bars either side of it so this did not really matter. We went into Cretoria Pub which was quite modern but had a good range of mainly foreign beers. We were both on the wheat beer and for the first time saw a few other England fans. I did go for a walk to try (unsuccessfully) to get proper tickets instead of our e-tickets but we ended up staying here until just before kick-off. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was only five minutes walk from the pub to the ground and we were in our seats again for the national anthems. We had gone for the more expensive Â£5 seats for this game and were in the front row of the upper tier just about on the half way line. We had a perfect view of what was a very good game with an excellent result. There were not a huge amount of England fans in the ground but there were quite a few Czechs and the atmosphere was reasonable.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After the game, we were going to start walking back to the hotel but it was raining quite heavily so we went back to Cretoria for another drink. There were a few England fans in there again and the atmosphere was good so we ended up staying for a few. We used the Bolt app again to get a taxi back to the hotel and went for another drink at the pub we had started in. After one in there we bought a litre of the NE IPA and went and sat on the terrace outside our room.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 23rdd June</span>
          We had breakfast in the hotel. We did not do a lot for the rest of the morning. We had chosen a room with a big terrace that is in the sun a lot of the day. There is not a huge amount of things to do in Batumi so it was nice to have a few hours lazing around with nothing to do.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out to see the sights of Batumi at 1. These consisted mainly of a slightly underwhelming sea front, the Alphabet Tower and a vaguely interesting moving metal sculpture. The sea-front may have looked better in the sun but in todays cloudy, grey conditions, it all had slightly depressing feel to it. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

          src="images/georgia_010.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After seeing the sights, we continued walking along "Batumi Boulevard", the main walkway along the beach, until we were level with the football ground again. By this time the cloud had turned to drizzle and not long after, heavy rain again. This time we did still walk back to the hotel but with several stops to shelter along the way. We bought pies for lunch and a litre of wine for tonight and returned to our room for the rest of the afternoon.
