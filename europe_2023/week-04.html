          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 22nd June - Czechia v England</span>
          We were awake by 6:30, got straight up and checked out of the hotel 15 minutes later. We walked back to Liberty Square and got the metro to the central station. We bought provisions for breakfast and the rest of the journey and went into the station. We got there just as boarding had started so went to the platform and got on the train to Batumi. The train was crowded but more modern than expected and quite comfortable. It left exactly on time at 8:00.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As the train is mainly serving three Black Sea Coast resorts, it was full of people going on holidays. Despite the abundance of children and the lack of power points it was a pleasant enough journey. As with all our previous trains in Russia and Ukraine, this one arrived exactly on time at 13:12. It was all a bit chaotic outside the station so we abandoned the idea of getting a minibus into town and used the Bolt app to order a taxi. This turned up after about five minutes and five minutes later we were at Hotel N16 where we have a room booked  for the next three nights.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We left the hotel at 3 and had a similar plan to yesterday. The ground is about two miles from where we are staying and we decided to walk there and stop for food/drinks on the way. Once again there are a few craft beer bars in the area. We started at Bevri Pub the nearest one to our hotel. This had a good range of beers but was a bit small meaning we had to sit at the bar. The 7% NE IPA was a good way to start the days drinking. We then found a restaurant that seemed to specialise in Khachapuri Adjaruli, one of the Georgian specialties that we had yet to try. We shared one of these for lunch with another beer.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The next couple of craft beer pubs on my list did not open until 5 so we ended up getting to the ground a bit earlier than expected. There were a couple of bars either side of it so this did not really matter. We went into Creatoria Pub which was quite modern but had a good range of mainly foreign beers. We were both on the wheat beer and for the first time saw a few other England fans. I did go for a walk to try (unsuccessfully) to get proper tickets instead of our e-tickets but we ended up staying here until just before kick-off. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was only five minutes walk from the pub to the ground and we were in our seats again for the national anthems. We had gone for the more expensive Â£5 seats for this game and were in the front row of the upper tier just about on the half way line. We had a perfect view of what was a very good game with an excellent result. There were not a huge amount of England fans in the ground but there were quite a few Czechs and the atmosphere was reasonable.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After the game, we were going to start walking back to the hotel but it was raining quite heavily so we went back to Cretoria for another drink. There were a few England fans in there again and the atmosphere was good so we ended up staying for a few. We used the Bolt app again to get a taxi back to the hotel and went for another drink at the pub we had started in. After one in there we bought a litre of the NE IPA and went and sat on the terrace outside our room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 23rd June</span>
          We had breakfast in the hotel. We did not do a lot for the rest of the morning. We had chosen a room with a big terrace that is in the sun a lot of the day. There is not a huge amount of things to do in Batumi so it was nice to have a few hours lazing around with nothing to do.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out to see the sights of Batumi at 1. These consisted mainly of a slightly underwhelming sea front, the Alphabet Tower and a vaguely interesting moving metal sculpture. The sea-front may have looked better in the sun but in todays cloudy, grey conditions, it all had slightly depressing feel to it. 
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After seeing the sights, we continued walking along "Batumi Boulevard", the main walkway along the beach, until we were level with the football ground again. By this time the cloud had turned to drizzle and not long after, heavy rain again. This time we did still walk back to the hotel but with several stops to shelter along the way. We bought pies for lunch and a litre of draft wine in a plastic bottle for tonight. We returned to our room for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a couple of drinks on our terrace before going out. We had planned to go to a few craft beer bars near the hotel but got to Sami Ludi and never got any further. It was a much nicer pub than Bevri Pub and we had good seats by the bar. We think we had seven rounds in there and some deep fried cheese balls with chips. When we got back to the hotel it would appear that we drank most of the litre of wine that we had bought but I do not have any recollection of this.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 24th June</span>
          It was a much better day weather wise today. However, I am not sure if it was the 7% beer or the vin plastique but we were both feeling quite rough for most of the day. We did not have a lot to do again so this was not the end of the world. We made it down to breakfast but spent most of the rest of the day in the room or on the terrace.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I did go out for a walk at 2pm. We had decided last night that we should buy tickets for both the Georgian quarter finals. We do not know if England will qualify yet but they should do and we will be in Tbilisi and Kutaisi on the days of both games anyway. This was a wasted journey as the ticket office in Batumi is only able to sell tickets for Batumi matches for some reason. I walked back along Batumi Boulevard and the beach did look marginally more appealing in the sun.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We did manage to both leave the hotel to go out and eat in the evening. We ate at a restaurant just over the road from the hotel (more khinkali and a mushroom chashushuli) and after a quick walk round the port area, returned to the room to watch the second half of Georgia v Belgium.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 25th June - England v Israel</span>
          It was another 6:30 alarm and an early departure from the hotel. We had a quick look around for something to eat but gave up and got a  taxi to the station. We bought food and got on the 8:10 train which predictably left on time. We did not have seats together for this journey but were only a couple of rows apart and it was for less than two hours anyway.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text">
          At 10:00 we arrived in Kutaisi International Airport Station which does not appear to be anywhere near Kutaisi or the airport. After a bit of dithering, we got a taxi to Hotel Gentiadi, about 30 minutes away in the centre. The hotel is a bit dated but is in a good location by the river and will be fine for the one night we are here.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We dropped our stuff in the room and went out for a walk to the football  ground. I had already bought tickets for the Tbilisi quarter final on-line but thought we would be able to buy real tickets for the Kutaisi game at the ground. They were only selling tickets for tonights game but they did give us a couple of blank tickets for tonights game which was better than nothing.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We returned to the room and bought the quarter final tickets on-line and also started looking into flight options for getting away from Georgia back to Munich. We can not really book anything until we know whether or not we are going to get to the semi-finals but needed some idea of what is available.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out for the day at 3:15. We had been on the train earlier with an English couple who had suggested meeting up later at Mary's Irish Pub. We were keen on going to the two nearby German pubs instead. We started at the Weihenstephan "Beer Museum" which was an incredible building that would not be out of place in Bavaria. Their excellent beer was served in litre glasses and went down very easily. I had a couple of litres in there together with more khinkali and a kupati, a Georgian pork sausage. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a couple of hours in there, we went to meet Carl and Cath. They had not made it to Mary's yet and as the beer selection was not great, we went back across the road to the Hacker Pschorr house for one while we waited. We saw them go into Mary's and went to join them when we had finished our drinks. We got a taxi to the ground together at about 7:30 and were in the ground in plenty of time for the 8:00 kick-off.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was another good game for England and the result, together with the fact that Czechia beat Germany means that not only have we qualified, but we have won the group with a game to spare. This means we will be playing back in Kutaisi in a weeks time.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/georgia_014.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After the game, we got another taxi back to Mary's. Carl and Cath went after one drink but there were a few others in there mainly people we had been with after the game in Batumi. The beer selection was getting more and more limited so we also left after one and went back to the Weihenstephan. We were joined by a few other people and did not leave there until 2:45am.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 26th June</span>
          We checked out of the hotel at about 9:55 as we had arranged to meet Carl and Cath on the White Bridge at 10:00. We shared a taxi for the 30 minute journey back to the train station. We all had tickets for the 11:27 train back to Batumi which appeared on time as usual. We were back in Batumi at 1:15. This time, Roz and I were not staying in the old town so we got in a taxi straight away to take us to our apartment, which was just a bit further away than the football ground.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The area around the apartment did not look too appealing but inside it was fine. It is on the 18th floor of a tower block and just about has a view of the sea between a couple of other tower blocks. Once the owner had let us in and shown us around, we went out to the supermarket to buy lunch.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After an hour or so recovering, we went out for a walk back to the old town. We walked a different way to the way we have been before and saw Europa Square for the first time. The old town is a nicer area than where we are staying now so we were also looking at options for somewhere to stay for the semi-final and final, both of which will be in Batumi.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          By the time we were back at the apartment, we were both totally knackered. Neither of us could be bothered to go too far to eat so we had tea in a Turkish restaurant just over the road from the apartment. The food was actually very good. We were back in the apartment by 8 and had a much needed early night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 27th June</span>
          Another day of bad weather. The forecast was thundery showers and this proved to be correct although they were a lot more than showers. We went out to a couple of shops to buy food in between the downpours but spent a lot of the day sat in the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We did have a few things to sort out so once again, this was not the end of the world. We made a decision on the rest of our time in Georgia so had a few things to book. The main decision is that we have booked flights back to Munich via Istanbul for Sunday 9th July - the day after the U21 final. We also booked a train back to Batumi and tickets for the semi-final. Still need to book our hotel for an overnight stay in Istanbul and somewhere for our first night back in Germany but everything else is sorted.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The weather had brightened up a bit by the afternoon and by 3, it was nice enough to go out for a five mile walk. I walked out along the beach in the opposite direction to usual and ended up walking out past the airport. Roz stayed and sat on the beach for half an hour or so. By the time we were both back, it was sunny enough to sit on the balcony.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After an hour or so in the apartment, we sampled one of the bottles of "house wine" that our host had given us. This tasted considerably better than the vin plastique from a few nights ago but did not taste particularly like wine. We just had the one glass before walking back into the old town. We had a brief stop at Neptune Square which is I think about the only sight in the centre we had not yet seen. We had arranged to meet Carl and Phil (who we had met in Mary's pub after the last game) in Popeye's which was just round the corner from our last hotel in Batumi.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a couple of drinks in there and then went to the "Hofbrauhaus" as it appeared to be the only place in the area showing the Georgia v Netherlands game. This was another excellent building but the service was terrible. We just had one drink in there while watching the second half of the match. As soon as it had finished, we returned to Popeye's for one before Roz and I got a taxi back to where we are staying. We had not eaten anything all evening so stopped at another Turkish restaurant and shared a pide before returning to the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 28th June - England v Germany</span>
          A much better day today so we spent the morning making the most of the sun. Roz went to lie on the beach while I walked about seven miles to the other side of the old town and back. We were back in the apartment by lunchtime.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 3:30. We started in Beer Yard about ten minutes walk from where we are staying, on the way to the ground. This is next to the Batumi Brewery and all seems part of the same place. We had been aiming to get here before the first game in Batumi but got stuck in Creatoria. Here we found the cheapest beer we have seen in Georgia and the cheapest we have seen anywhere for a long time. It was â¾2 (about 60p) for 0.4l of their lager which was quite drinkable. We had a few in there before walking another ten minutes back to Creatoria where we had arranged to meet Carl, Cath and Phil.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          They were all there by 6 and we had a few more beers before crossing the road to the ground. We had a bit of a disagreement with a steward who would not let us sit in our front row seats but it was all sorted out by kick-off so once again, we had a perfect view of the game, a few seats along from where we were sat six days ago. Considering that this was a game against Germany, it was a very easy win and not that exciting. Once England scored in the 5th minute, the game was just about all over. England have now won all of their group games without conceding a goal.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After the game, we all went back to Creatoria where we were joined by a couple who are in some way connected to the hotel that Carl and Cath are staying in and where we will be staying next week. We had a few more in there before everyone left and then we walked back to the apartment. We had one more glass of the house red on the balcony before bed.
