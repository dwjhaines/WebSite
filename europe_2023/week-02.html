          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th June - Perl to Trier - 32.9 miles - 439 ft</span>
          Yesterday was due to be our last day of cycling the Moselradweg and we had planned to just get the train back from Koblenz to Trier today. However, there was 20% of the route that we had not yet done (South-East of Trier) so we decided to get a train to Perl and complete the 50km that we had not yet done.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had breakfast in the apartment and cycled to the main station. Today was a bank holiday in Germany meaning that it was free to take our bikes with us but also meant that there were a lot of people travelling about. The platform at Koblenz was packed but we got our bikes onto the 10:06 train to Trier and managed to get seats. A lot of this journey was along the banks of the Moselle through the places we have been to in the last few days so was quite interesting. At Trier, we changed to another train for Perl. This one was a lot less crowded and got us to Perl at 12:40.

          Perl is near the border of Germany, France and Luxembourg. It is also just the other side of the river to Schengen in Luxembourg. After getting off the train we crossed the bridge to Schengen, mainly just so we could say we had been there. We returned to the German side of the river and joined the Moselradweg at its starting point. It was another easy ride of about 50km back to Trier. This was probably not the most spectacular section of the cycle route but was an enjoyable enough way of spending the afternoon anyway and meant that we had completed the entire route. It took us just over three hours and just after 4pm, we arrived back at the B&B hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 6:30. We were both pretty knackered after the last few days and were in need of another day off alcohol. We returned to Burger House where we had eaten last Friday, had very good burgers again and were back in the hotel just after 8.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th June</span>
          We left the B&B and drove to a supermarket where we bought things for breakfast and lunch, a few provisions for the next three days and a case of beer. We had booked three nights in the same apartment we had stayed in a couple of years ago in Bacharach. We stopped to eat just outside Trier and then had a drive of about 90 minutes to Bacharach. We had hoped to be able to park the car at the apartment and go out on our bikes. As it was, the apartment was ready when we arrived and we could move straight in. After changing hotels every day so far on this trip, it was nice to be able to be in the same place for a few days.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We bought most of our stuff in from the car and sorted out a few things before going out on our bikes. We cycled down The Rhine to Boppard, a trip of about 18 miles. It was a nice enough ride although slightly harder coming back up river and into quite a strong wind. Roz wanted a break by the time we got back to Sankt Goar so we did the last nine miles separately but were both back before 5.

          We had a couple  of drinks on our terrace before walking into the centre of Bacarach. We stopped for a couple more at Weingut Karl Heidrich and then went to Kurpfälzische Münze, a really nice little place tha we had not been in before. We had a bottle of wine in there together with a cheese platter. All very enjoyable. After there we went back to Kupferkanne the pub type place that we have been in there. Four drinks each in there bought the evening to an end!

          Spent the morning sorting out our washing and sitting on the terrace.
