          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th June - Perl to Trier - 32.9 miles - 439 ft</span>
          Yesterday was due to be our last day of cycling the Moselradweg and we had planned to just get the train back from Koblenz to Trier today. However, there was 20% of the route that we had not yet done (South-East of Trier) so we decided to get a train to Perl and complete the 50km that we had not yet done.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had breakfast in the apartment and cycled to the main station. Today was a bank holiday in Germany meaning that it was free to take our bikes with us but also meant that there were a lot of people travelling about. The platform at Koblenz was packed but we got our bikes onto the 10:06 train to Trier and managed to get seats. A lot of this journey was along the banks of the Moselle through the places we have been to in the last few days so was quite interesting. At Trier, we changed to another train for Perl. This one was a lot less crowded and got us to Perl at 12:40.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Perl is near the border of Germany, France and Luxembourg. It is also just the other side of the river to Schengen in Luxembourg. After getting off the train we crossed the bridge to Schengen, mainly just so we could say we had been there. We returned to the German side of the river and joined the Moselradweg at its starting point. It was another easy ride of about 50km back to Trier. This was probably not the most spectacular section of the cycle route but was an enjoyable enough way of spending the afternoon anyway and meant that we had completed the entire route. It took us just over three hours and just after 4pm, we arrived back at the B&B hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 6:30. We were both pretty knackered after the last few days and were in need of another day off alcohol. We returned to Burger House where we had eaten last Friday, had very good burgers again and were back in the hotel just after 8.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th June</span>
          We left the B&B and drove to a supermarket where we bought things for breakfast and lunch, a few provisions for the next three days and a case of beer. We had booked three nights in the same apartment we had stayed in a couple of years ago in Bacharach. We stopped to eat just outside Trier and then had a drive of about 90 minutes to Bacharach. We had hoped to be able to park the car at the apartment and go out on our bikes. As it was, the apartment was ready when we arrived and we could move straight in. After changing hotels every day so far on this trip, it was nice to be able to be in the same place for a few days.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We bought most of our stuff in from the car and sorted out a few things before going out on our bikes. We cycled down The Rhine to Boppard, a trip of about 18 miles. It was a nice enough ride although slightly harder coming back up river and into quite a strong wind. Roz wanted a break by the time we got back to Sankt Goar so we did the last nine miles separately but were both back before 5.

          We had a couple  of drinks on our terrace before walking into the centre of Bacarach. We stopped for a couple more at Weingut Karl Heidrich and then went to Kurpfälzische Münze, a really nice little place that we had not been in before. We had a bottle of wine in there together with a cheese platter. All very enjoyable. After there we went back to Kupferkanne the pub type place that we have been in before. Four drinks each in there bought the evening to an end!

          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th June</span>
          Spent the morning sorting out our washing and sitting on the terrace.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We decided today to go on separate rides today. I was keen on a long ride so arranged to meet Roz at a beer garden in Bingen, about 10 miles up the Rhine at 5. I wanted to do about 50 miles and headed up the Rhine in the direction of Mainz. I was unsure whether or not to go all the way to Mainz but decided to go in that direction and see how I was doing for time. I left at about 12:30 and all was going to plan until Bingen. A few miles the other side of Bingen, the route became unexpectedly unsurfaced for about five miles which slowed me down considerably. I had given up on Mainz at this stage but I got through this section and made up some of the lost time. With about ten miles to go, I decided I could still do it and get back to Bingen on time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          About a mile after deciding this, I got a puncture in my back tyre. I was 11 miles past Bingen so had enough time to ride slowly back and meet Roz. I phoned her and told her to bring an inner tube and pump with her. I then found that there was a bike shop about 7 miles away near a station. I decided to head there instead and try and get a new tube before cycling on to Bingen. Two miles before the shop I came to Ingelheim station so decided to get the train to Bingen instead. I bought my ticket and waited for the 15:21 train only to be told that the bike spaces were all full so was not allowed on.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The next train was not until 16:01 so I decided to cycle to the bike shop at Gau-Algesheim, buy a replacement tube and get the next train from there instead. I managed to buy the tube but then found that the 16:01 train did not stop there. I then had to change the tube but discovered that I did not have tyre levers with me. It was back to the bike shop which was now closed but they did have tools and a pump outside that I could use. I sorted out the tyre and then had a seven mile ride to meet Roz. This involved going over a big hill which I could have done without but I made it to the beer garden with a few minutes to spare.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          By this time I was hot, tired and very thirsty. I had not taken nearly enough water with me and had not had time to stop and buy anything to eat and drink since leaving Bacharch. A wheat beer plus the bread roll and water that Roz had bought with her improved the situation and after our drink we cycled back for another in a beer garden on the outskirts of Bacharach. We were back at the apartment by about 7:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had decided yesterday that as our balcony was such a nice place to sit that we would spend the evening there tonight. Roz had bought ham, cheese, etc earlier and we spent a couple of hours sat looking at the Rhine with the food and a few drinks. We watched the first half of the Champions League final on my phone and then moved inside to watch the second half on the tele. We joined the J-Team chat for an hour or so when the football had finished and got to bed at about 1am.

          Another morning spent not doing a lot apart from sitting on the terrace. Once again we decided to do separate bike rides this time meeting at Rüdesheim, opposite Bingen on the other side of The Rhine. This meant that I just about had to get to Mainz as that is the first place up-river from Bacharach that has a bridge.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Today's ride was more successful. I took a different route out of Bingen and avoided the unsurfaced section that I went on yesterday. This route rejoined the Rhineradweg after a few miles and it was a fairly straightforward, if not particularly scenic ride from there all the way into Mainz. I got into the centre of Mainz at about 2:30 and spent 30 minutes or so wandering round the centre before crossing the Rhine and starting my trip back down the other side. The 20 miles from Mainz to Rüdesheim was probably the nicest part of the ride. It was mainly downhill with the wind behind me and the route took me through plenty of nice little towns.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I got to Rüdesheim just before 5 and met Roz in a bar overlooking the river. She had not had such an enjoyable journey as part of the cycle path she was using was closed and the detour along the road was not ideal. We had planned to cycle back this way but instead, after our drink, got the ferry back to Bingen and cycled back to Bacharach from there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We cycled into the centre of Bacharach and returned to Kurpfälzische Münze. We had decided that we would eat on our terrace again but sat outside there and had a few drinks before returning to the apartment by 8ish. This competed a ride of just over 101km for me. After showers, we had a similar meal to last nights with a few more drinks before having a relatively early night. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 12th June</span>
          We were awake earlier this morning. We had breakfast on the terrace again and after doing some packing sat back in the sun for an hour or so before departing. We left the apartment just before 10. We had a stop in Bacharach to buy wine and another just outside Bingen for petrol before getting on the motorway. We got round Mainz and then joined the A3 motorway which was to take us all the way to our destination. There were quite a lot of roadworks on the route making it a bit slower than usual but we arrived at Erlangen B&B just after 2. The B&B is not really in Erlangen but on an industrial estate five miles to the South in Tennenlohe. Not the greatest of places to stay but it has a free car park where we can leave the car for three days while we stay in Nuremberg which is only about 7 miles away.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had not found anywhere to stop and eat lunch on the way down due to the roadworks so we ate our sandwiches in the room after checking in. There are not too many tourist attractions in Tennenlohe so with not much else to do we went out on our bikes for a couple of hours. We cycled into the centre of Erlangen and out for a few miles the other side before turning back.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As well as there being not a lot of tourist attractions here, there was not a great choice of restaurants that are open on a Monday. We were in need of a quiet night anyway so walked to the Norma supermarket, bought a couple of sandwiches and had our second meal in a row in the room.
