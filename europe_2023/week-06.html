          We had a late breakfast upstairs on the terrace but did not really do much else for the rest of the morning. At 11:30, Roz went up to lie on the terrace while I went for a walk to the ticket office. I was not really expecting much success here and sure enough, it was completely closed with no indication of if/when it is going to re-open. 
        </p>

          I did meet Phil again. He is staying over the road from the ground so is able to keep checking a bit more easily than us. We exchanged email addresses and I walked back to the hotel again. Quite an enjoyable walk despite the lack of tickets. Batumi has definitely grown on me since our first walk along the sea-front.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After I had recovered from the walk (it is very hot here again) we went out to buy khachapuris for lunch and ate them on the terrace. Again, we did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. Roz went back to the terrace and I chose to stay in the air-conditioned room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 7. We walked back into the old town looking for somewhere to eat and ended up in the same restaurant we had eaten in 12 days ago. After eating, we walked out to the sea front and had another look at the Ali and Nino statues. The whole area looked good as the sun was setting and again, it all seemed a lot nicer than when we had first seen it.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked along the front for a couple of miles until we got to the lake that is between the football stadium and the beach. Here every evening between 9 and midnight they have a dancing fountain display. There are several fountains with coloured lights and they come on and off in time to the music. It was all quite good and made better by all the illuminated high rise buildings in the background. Definitely worth the walk. We watched them for about 20 minutes before walking back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 7th July</span>
          We had breakfast on the terrace and at about 10:45, I made my way to the ground again. I got there at about 11:30 and unsurprisingly, there was no sign of the ticket office opening. There were quite a few people coming and going but no-one had any clue about what was going on. I went off a couple of times but by about 12:30, I was at the front of the queue and decided to stay there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Tickets for the semi-final had gone on sale at 2pm the day before the game. I thought I may as well stay where I was until that time. There were 15 - 20 people milling around and lots of others turning up, asking a few questions and leaving again. At about 1, someone from UEFA came out and told us that the final was sold out. He spoke in Russian first and then to me in English. Not what I wanted to hear!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I still decided to wait until 2 and see if anything happened. I spoke to a few other English people including Phil who were looking for tickets but things do not look very hopeful at the moment. While I was waiting, the UEFA bloke called me over and gave me a free ticket which was very good of him. I think he noticed how upset I was when he announced that the game was sold out! I really needed three as Steve is flying out today but it is a start. Nothing happened at 2 so I walked back to the hotel and we went for lunch at a cafe a couple of doors down the road.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 4:30. Steve was due to arrive at 6:25 and we had said that we would go and meet him at the airport. The airport is about four miles away and the most direct route takes you past the stadium. We started walking and thought we would go and have another look at the ticket office. When we got there, there were signs up saying that the game was sold out. However, at that moment, Roz noticed that there were tickets back on sale on the web site. At the same time, I got a WhatsApp message from my friend at UEFA saying that he could get me two tickets. Roz bought two tickets while I met up with the UEFA bloke and bought another two. This meant that we now had five tickets. We know plenty of people who are looking for tickets so having too many does not matter.

          We had planned to keep walking to the airport but after all the stress of ticket purchasing, we went directly to Beer Yard. We had a couple in there and then got a taxi to the airport. Steve landed on time. It took a while to get back to the hotel because of the traffic but we were all on our way out again by 8ish. We walked into the centre of the old town and returned to Sami Ludi. We ended up spending the whole evening in there again and returned to the hotel when it shut at 1:30. While in the bar, we sold our spare tickets to Stas, Carl's mate from the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th July</span>
          The three of us went out for breakfast at 10. We ate at the restaurant near the hotel that we have had lunch at previously. After eating, we took Steve to get a SIM card and then went round a few of the sights along the sea-front again. We were back in the hotel by 1 for much needed showers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We all went out at 3. We had told a few people that we would be in Beer Yard by 4 and went straight there as there are not too many places to drink on the way. We walked past the ground, got a good table and were joined by Phil. We had an enjoyable few hours in there and did not bother moving anywhere else before the game. We all ate there, and got through quite a few beers including 3 litres donated to us by a drunk couple on the next table.

          We headed to the ground just before 7. I had given Steve the free ticket I had been given so he was in the upper tier close to where we had been for previous games here. Roz and I were in the lower tier behind the goal. The game was excellent although the last ten minutes or so were a bit stressful! We stayed around for about half an hour after the final whistle watching the celebrations and then went back to Creatoria for a final time.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Phil was already in there when we arrived and we were joined by Matty and Ayesha(?). Not as many England fans in there as there have been after some games but there were a few others as well and it was another enjoyable couple of hours. We left there when they stopped serving at 1, got a taxi back to the hotel and went and sat on the roof terrace with a final beer of the day.

          Roz and I were due to fly out of Batumi at 21:30 but had to check out of the hotel at 12:00 which was not ideal. We tried to get a later check-out but it was not possible. This was not made better by the fact that it was raining heavily all morning with no sign of it drying up. Despite all of this, the day was not too bad. We went out for breakfast at 10 and then had an hour or so back in the room. When we checked out, we left our luggage in Steve's room (he is leaving tomorrow) and went and sat in reception watching the rain. The rain eased by about 1 so we were all able to go out.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked up to Europa Square and then out to the Agricultural Market about 2km away towards the train station. This was not too different to the market in Kutaisi with a similar range of produce.. After 20 minutes or so in here, we walked back into the old town and went for a meal in the restaurant we have eaten in a couple of times already. We took our time over eating and walked back to the hotel by about 4:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
          The weather was still not great and we did not have anything else we wanted to do so we got a taxi straight to the airport. We were at the airport by 5ish so had another four and a half hours to kill. We found seats in the check in area and were fortunate that someone came and sat next to us with a laptop showing the end of the test match. We watched England beat Australia in the 3rd test before going through departures. By the time we got through, it was only two hours until the flight was due to depart.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          It was quite sad to be leaving Georgia. We were not sure how long we were going to stay here but have enjoyed the whole three weeks. Although the sights have not been too spectacular, we have enjoyed each of the three cities we have stayed in and have always had enough to do without getting bored. The wine has been a bit of a disappointment but the food has been good, the beer excellent and we have found some very good bars. The locals have all been friendly wherever we have been and we have met a lot more England fans than we usually meet during tournaments. On top of all that, the football has been excellent and we have finally seen England win a trophy.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The flight left a bit late but arrived in İstanbul Havalimanı Airport a bit early at 10:30. However it then took about 15 - 20 minutes to taxi to the stand and then another 10 - 15 minute walk to get to immigration. The airport won the last year "best airport in the world" awards but, as with most airports that win that sort of award, is actually pretty crap. In fairness, getting through immigration was fairly efficient, about the only positive thing I could say about it. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Once through, we needed to contact our hotel to let them know we were here so they could pick us up. We needed to connect to the free WiFi but this proved impossible. I am not sure if it was just not working or if they make it incredibly difficult to use but neither of us could get on it. We went outside to the pick-up point but had no idea who was picking us up or how they would find us. Eventually, Roz found a very helpful man who got in touch with the hotel and let us use his phone for WiFi so that we could contact them by WhatsApp. The transfer turned up fairly soon after this and we were in the hotel just after midnight.

          <span class="diary-date">Monday 10th July</span>
          We had chosen this hotel (Heaven Inn) because although it is in the middle of nowhere, there are a few shops and restaurants within walking distance. We stayed in the room until we checked out at about 11:45 and then went out for a late breakfast/early lunch at a local kebab restaurant. We both had excellent meals of kofta, salad, etc. We walked round the small town and then went back to sit in the hotel reception area while we waited for our 1:30 transfer back to the airport.

          We were back at the airport by about 1:40 and got through security and immigration fairly quickly. This gave us just over two hours to wait for the 4:15 Turkish Airways flight back to Munich. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The flight left on time and we landed on time in Munich just before 6pm. Getting through the airport was relatively quick. We got the S-Bahn back to Besucherpark and walked back to the car park where the car and bikes were exactly how we we had left them. The car started second time which was a relief and by 6:25, we were on our way. We had booked the Ibis hotel in Landshut for the night and were there in less than an hour.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were both tired and not bothered about walking into town but there was a Weihenstephan Stuben just over the road. This had looked a good place when we were here last time but was closed the day we were here. We walked over there, had a few beers and a very good meal before walking back to the hotel for our free drink. An enjoyable first evening back in Germany.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 11th July</span>
          We left the hotel at 9ish and walked into the centre of Landshut. We bought breakfast from a bakery and ate it sat at one of the temporary stands set up for the annual wedding celebration festival thing that takes place here every year at this time. We walked back to the hotel and checked out just after 10:15.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We left the hotel and drove to ReWe where we got rid of our plastic bottle collection. We then had a drive of about an hour and 20 minutes to our next hotel, the B&B in Passau. We got there just before midday. We were not able to check in but were also told that we were not able to leave our car there while we cycle down the Danube for the next week. This was fair enough really - there are a lot of people who would want to do the same thing - and they did give us directions to a car park where we will be able to leave the car for about €30 which is not too bad.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As we had time to kill, we went out on our bikes for a few hours. There was a bike shop near the hotel where we bought a couple of things we need for the next week. We then headed into the centre of Passau which is a couple of miles from where we are staying. We then joined the Innradweg and cycled up the German side of the river for about 10 miles to Neuhaus am Inn. This ride was quite tough a it was quite hilly and mainly on unsurfaced tracks. The heat did not help.

        <p class="diary-text">
          At Neuhaus, we crossed the river to Schärding which is on the Austrian side. We had lunch by the river and cycled back to Passau. This side was easier but Roz was still struggling a bit by the time we got back to the hotel. We were able to check in when we got back and started sorting out our stuff for tomorrow. We went out again at about 6:30 and went back into Passau, a walk of about 50 minutes. We found a restaurant that kept us both happy - it was a pizzeria that sold Paulaner beer! We had the best pizzas we have had so far on this trip with a few drinks before walking back to the hotel along the river.
