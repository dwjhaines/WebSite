          We had a late breakfast upstairs on the terrace but did not really do much else for the rest of the morning. At 11:30, Roz went up to lie on the terrace while I went for a walk to the ticket office. I was not really expecting much success here and sure enough, it was completely closed with no indication of if/when it is going to re-open.

          I did meet Phil again. He is staying over the road from the ground so is able to keep checking a bit more easily than us. We exchanged email addresses and I walked back to the hotel again. Quite an enjoyable walk despite the lack of tickets. Batumi has definitely grown on me since our first walk along the sea-front.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After I had recovered from the walk (it is very hot here again) we went out to buy khachapuris for lunch and ate them on the terrace. Again, we did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. Roz went back to the terrace and I chose to stay in the air-conditioned room.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 7. We walked back into the old town looking for somewhere to eat and ended up in the same restaurant we had eaten in 12 days ago. After eating, we walked out to the sea front and had another look at the Ali and Nino statues. The whole area looked good as the sun was setting and again, it all seemed a lot nicer than when we had first seen it.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked along the front for a couple of miles until we got to the lake that is between the football stadium and the beach. Here every evening between 9 and midnight they have a dancing fountain display. There are several fountains with coloured lights and they come on and off in time to the music. It was all quite good and made better by all the illuminated high rise buildings in the background. Definitely worth the walk. We watched them for about 20 minutes before walking back to the hotel.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 7th July</span>
          We had breakfast on the terrace and at about 10:45, I made my way to the ground again. I got there at about 11:30 and unsurprisingly, there was no sign of the ticket office opening. There were quite a few people coming and going but no-one had any clue about what was going on. I went off a couple of times but by about 12:30, I was at the front of the queue and decided to stay there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Tickets for the semi-final had gone on sale at 2pm the day before the game. I thought I may as well stay where I was until that time. There were 15 - 20 people milling around and lots of others turning up, asking a few questions and leaving again. At about 1, someone from UEFA came out and told us that the final was sold out. He spoke in Russian first and then to me in English. Not what I wanted to hear!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I still decided to wait until 2 and see if anything happened. I spoke to a few other English people including Phil who were looking for tickets but things do not look very hopeful at the moment. While I was waiting, the UEFA bloke called me over and gave me a free ticket which was very good of him. I think he noticed how upset I was when he announced that the game was sold out! I really needed three as Steve is flying out today but it is a start. Nothing happened at 2 so I walked back to the hotel and we went for lunch at a cafe a couple of doors down the road.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 4:30. Steve was due to arrive at 6:25 and we had said that we would go and meet him at the airport. The airport is about four miles away and the most direct route takes you past the stadium. We started walking and thought we would go and have another look at the ticket office. When we got there, there were signs up saying that the game was sold out. However, at that moment, Roz noticed that there were tickets back on sale on the web site. At the same time, I got a WhatsApp message from my friend at UEFA saying that he could get me two tickets. Roz bought two tickets while I met up with the UEFA bloke and bought another two. This meant that we now had five tickets. We know plenty of people who are looking for tickets so having too many does not matter.

          We had planned to keep walking to the airport but after all the stress of ticket purchasing, we went directly to Beer Yard. We had a couple in there and then got a taxi to the airport. Steve landed on time. It took a while to get back to the hotel because of the traffic but we were all on our way out again by 8ish. We walked into the centre of the old town and returned to Sami Ludi. We ended up spending the whole evening in there again and returned to the hotel when it shut at 1:30. While in the bar, we sold our spare tickets to Stas, Carl's mate from the hotel.

          The three of us went out for breakfast at 10. We ate at the restaurant near the hotel that we have had lunch at previously. After eating, we took Steve to get a SIM card and then went round a few of the sights along the sea-front again. We were back in the hotel by 1 for much needed showers.
