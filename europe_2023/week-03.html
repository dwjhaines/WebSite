          Today we had a daytrip to Bamberg. We met in reception  at 10:15, with no sign of any hangovers. We walked to the station, bought two all day tickets (two adults per ticket) and got the 10:40 train which got into Bamberg at 11:30. We did not walk straight into the centre but went out to a couple of breweries - Brauerei Keesmann and Brauerei Mahr - in an area where Hoggy had stayed previously. Both nice places with the second of the two having an excellent beer garden.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a few beers, we did walk into town. We stopped for lunch and another beer at Brauhaus Zum Sternla as it was on the way and then made it to Schlenkerla, probably the most famous pub in Bamberg. We had a good table in the self-service part of the bar which was ideal so spent most of the afternoon drinking their rauchbier.

          We were all quite pissed by the time we left here. We stopped for one in Klosterbräu and then started making our way towards the station. We stopped at another two breweries on the way, Brauerei Spezial and Brauerei Fässle, both places that we have been to a few times before. We all had the very good schnitzels in Brauerei Fässle and bought a bottle of beer each to take away for the train journey. We caught the 9:38 train back to Nuremberg and had a final beer of the day in the bar underneath the Frauentorturm. Another very good session!

          We did not see Dave or Hoggy this morning as they were both flying home. We walked to Lidl at the station and bought breakfast which we ate in the room. We checked out at about 10:30 and walked through the station to where our bikes were still locked up. We had a few problems getting out of the compound and got told off for both going through on one ticket but we had paid the correct amount and had not really done anything wrong. It had still worked reasonably well and it was not bad value at €0.70 per bike, per day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a stop in our souvenir shop in the market square and then cycled back to Tennenlohe where the car was still in the B&B car park. After sorting out our luggage and putting the bikes on the back of the car, we were on our way to our next destination - Kelheim - by about 11:30. This was not too long a journey and we arrived at Brauerei & Gasthof Frischeisen shortly after 1pm. It is a slightly strange place on the outskirts of the town but is a nice enough room for a couple of  days.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After showers, we walked into Kelheim, a walk of about half an hour. We got lunch from a supermarket and walked round the old town. We did look at the Schneider Weisses Bräuhaus but resisted the temptation to go for a drink. We are in need of a day off!. We could not be bothered to go out on our bikes again today but did find the routes for our planned trip tomorrow. We were back in the room not long after 4.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Neither of us had any great desire to walk back into Kelheim again this evening. There was a take-away pizza place over the road from where we are staying so we got a couple of pizzas and ate them in the outdoor area of our brewery (it is closed tonight). We had wanted to watch the Malta v England game but we had no working WiFi, the picture was lagging a lot and it did not look a wonderful game anyway. We watched most of it until England had gone 3 - 0 up and then went back to following it on Flash Scores until it finished.
