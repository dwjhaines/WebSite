          Today we had a daytrip to Bamberg. We met in reception  at 10:15, with no sign of any hangovers. We walked to the station, bought two all day tickets (two adults per ticket) and got the 10:40 train which got into Bamberg at 11:30. We did not walk straight into the centre but went out to a couple of breweries - Brauerei Keesmann and Brauerei Mahr - in an area where Hoggy had stayed previously. Both nice places with the second of the two having an excellent beer garden.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a few beers, we did walk into town. We stopped for lunch and another beer at Brauhaus Zum Sternla as it was on the way and then made it to Schlenkerla, probably the most famous pub in Bamberg. We had a good table in the self-service part of the bar which was ideal so spent most of the afternoon drinking their rauchbier.

          We were all quite pissed by the time we left here. We stopped for one in Klosterbräu and then started making our way towards the station. We stopped at another two breweries on the way, Brauerei Spezial and Brauerei Fässle, both places that we have been to a few times before. We all had the very good schnitzels in Brauerei Fässle and bought a bottle of beer each to take away for the train journey. We caught the 9:38 train back to Nuremberg and had a final beer of the day in the bar underneath the Frauentorturm. Another very good session!

          We did not see Dave or Hoggy this morning as they were both flying home. We walked to Lidl at the station and bought breakfast which we ate in the room. We checked out at about 10:30 and walked through the station to where our bikes were still locked up. We had a few problems getting out of the compound and got told off for both going through on one ticket but we had paid the correct amount and had not really done anything wrong. It had still worked reasonably well and it was not bad value at €0.70 per bike, per day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a stop in our souvenir shop in the market square and then cycled back to Tennenlohe where the car was still in the B&B car park. After sorting out our luggage and putting the bikes on the back of the car, we were on our way to our next destination - Kelheim - by about 11:30. This was not too long a journey and we arrived at Brauerei & Gasthof Frischeisen shortly after 1pm. It is a slightly strange place on the outskirts of the town but is a nice enough room for a couple of  days.

          After showers, we walked into Kelheim, a walk of about half an hour. We got lunch from a supermarket and walked round the old town. We did look at the Schneider Weisses Bräuhaus but resisted the temptation to go for a drink. We are in need of a day off!. We could not be bothered to go out on our bikes again today but did find the routes for our planned trip tomorrow. We were back in the room not long after 4.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Neither of us had any great desire to walk back into Kelheim again this evening. There was a take-away pizza place over the road from where we are staying so we got a couple of pizzas and ate them in the outdoor area of our brewery (it is closed tonight). We had wanted to watch the Malta v England game but we had no working WiFi, the picture was lagging a lot and it did not look a wonderful game anyway. We watched most of it until England had gone 3 - 0 up and then went back to following it on Flash Scores until it finished.

          A very good day. We had breakfast in the hotel (OK but not great) and went out on our bikes at about 9:45. The reason we are staying in Kelheim is for two breweries. However, we thought it would be a good idea to do a few miles on the bikes before starting drinking. We decided to cycle to Riedenburg, about 10 miles away. I had cycled here from Kipfenberg in 2018 and had intended to get to Kelheim. It had been too hot that day so I had not done this bit of the cycle route. Although it was mainly unsurfaced, the twenty mile round trip was very enjoyable and an easy enough ride We had a stop in front of the town hall in Riedenburg which seemed a pleasant enough little place.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got back into Kelheim by about midday and stopped just outside the old town for a couple of pizza slices that we had leftover from last night. We then embarked on the 6.4km ride to Weltenburg. Although this was not far away, it was up and down a very steep hill and on gravel tracks. At one point, Roz was struggling to push her bike up the hill let alone ride it but we made it to the top and the ride down was no-where near as steep. We made it to the monastery by 1:30.

          The beer garden here was as good as it was last time. We were sat a bit out of the way the last time we were here but we managed to get on the end of a table close to the main brewery building and had a very enjoyable couple of hours drinking the wheat beer (Roz) and the dunkel beer (me). We left the monastery at 3:15 and got the 3:40 ferry back to Kelheim - neither of us fancied cycling over the hill again!

          Back in Kelheim, we went straight to the Schneider Weisses Bräuhaus. Unlike yesterday, this time, we did have a few drinks and again, it was very good in here. Both places we have been so far today are very high up on my list of favourite places to drink.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We cycled back to our guest house and had showers. We had decided that it was too far to go back into Kelheim to drink and as we are staying at a brewery, we may as well just spend the evening here in the bar. We think we got through 11 wheat beers between us and it was another enjoyable evening.

          We checked out of where we were staying at 10:25..... exactly 12 hours before our flight to Tbilisi tonight. There was not a lot that we wanted to do today so left the car in the car park and walked into Kelheim again. Roz sat in a cafe in the centre while I continued walking up the hill to the Befreiungshalle (Liberation Hall). We have seen this from the distance a few times (and could see it from our bedroom window the last two nights) but had never walked up to it. It was nothing too spectacular but a nice enough walk anyway.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Back in the centre, I collected Roz and we walked back to the car. It was a drive of an hour and twenty minutes to the Besucherpark at the airport where we have paid to leave the car for the next three weeks. We left it in a multi-story car park with the bikes attached and walked half a mile to the S-Bahn station. We got the train to the airport where we arrived about seven and a half hours before our flight. We found somewhere to sit in Terminal 2 and Roz went to buy lunch from the supermarket in Terminal 1.
