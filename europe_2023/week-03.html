          Today we had a daytrip to Bamberg. We met in reception  at 10:15, with no sign of any hangovers. We walked to the station, bought two all day tickets (two adults per ticket) and got the 10:40 train which got into Bamberg at 11:30. We did not walk straight into the centre but went out to a couple of breweries - Brauerei Keesmann and Brauerei Mahr - in an area where Hoggy had stayed previously. Both nice places with the second of the two having an excellent beer garden.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a few beers, we did walk into town. We stopped for lunch and another beer at Brauhaus Zum Sternla as it was on the way and then made it to Schlenkerla, probably the most famous pub in Bamberg. We had a good table in the self-service part of the bar which was ideal so spent most of the afternoon drinking their rauchbier.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We were all quite pissed by the time we left here. We stopped for one in Klosterbräu and then started making our way towards the station. We stopped at another two breweries on the way, Brauerei Spezial and Brauerei Fässle, both places that we have been to a few times before. We all had the very good schnitzels in Brauerei Fässle and bought a bottle of beer each to take away for the train journey. We caught the 9:38 train back to Nuremberg and had a final beer of the day in the bar underneath the Frauentorturm. Another very good session!

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 16th June</span>
          We did not see Dave or Hoggy this morning as they were both flying home. We walked to Lidl at the station and bought breakfast which we ate in the room. We checked out at about 10:30 and walked through the station to where our bikes were still locked up. We had a few problems getting out of the compound and got told off for both going through on one ticket but we had paid the correct amount and had not really done anything wrong. It had still worked reasonably well and it was not bad value at €0.70 per bike, per day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a stop in our souvenir shop in the market square and then cycled back to Tennenlohe where the car was still in the B&B car park. After sorting out our luggage and putting the bikes on the back of the car, we were on our way to our next destination - Kelheim - by about 11:30. This was not too long a journey and we arrived at Brauerei & Gasthof Frischeisen shortly after 1pm. It is a slightly strange place on the outskirts of the town but is a nice enough room for a couple of  days.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          After showers, we walked into Kelheim, a walk of about half an hour. We got lunch from a supermarket and walked round the old town. We did look at the Schneider Weisses Bräuhaus but resisted the temptation to go for a drink. We are in need of a day off!. We could not be bothered to go out on our bikes again today but did find the routes for our planned trip tomorrow. We were back in the room not long after 4.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Neither of us had any great desire to walk back into Kelheim again this evening. There was a take-away pizza place over the road from where we are staying so we got a couple of pizzas and ate them in the outdoor area of our brewery (it is closed tonight). We had wanted to watch the Malta v England game but we had no working WiFi, the picture was lagging a lot and it did not look a wonderful game anyway. We watched most of it until England had gone 3 - 0 up and then went back to following it on Flash Scores until it finished.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 17th June</span>
          A very good day. We had breakfast in the hotel (OK but not great) and went out on our bikes at about 9:45. The reason we are staying in Kelheim is for two breweries. However, we thought it would be a good idea to do a few miles on the bikes before starting drinking. We decided to cycle to Riedenburg, about 10 miles away. I had cycled here from Kipfenberg in 2018 and had intended to get to Kelheim. It had been too hot that day so I had not done this bit of the cycle route. Although it was mainly unsurfaced, the twenty mile round trip was very enjoyable and an easy enough ride We had a stop in front of the town hall in Riedenburg which seemed a pleasant enough little place.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got back into Kelheim by about midday and stopped just outside the old town for a couple of pizza slices that we had leftover from last night. We then embarked on the 6.4km ride to Weltenburg. Although this was not far away, it was up and down a very steep hill and on gravel tracks. At one point, Roz was struggling to push her bike up the hill let alone ride it but we made it to the top and the ride down was no-where near as steep. We made it to the monastery by 1:30.

          The beer garden here was as good as it was last time. We were sat a bit out of the way the last time we were here but we managed to get on the end of a table close to the main brewery building and had a very enjoyable couple of hours drinking the wheat beer (Roz) and the dunkel beer (me). We left the monastery at 3:15 and got the 3:40 ferry back to Kelheim - by this time, neither of us were capable of cycling over the hill again!

        <p class="diary-text">
          Back in Kelheim, we went straight to the Schneider Weisses Bräuhaus. Unlike yesterday, this time we did have a few drinks and again, it was very good in here. Both the places we have been so far today are very high up on my list of favourite places to drink.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We cycled back to our guest house and had showers. We had decided that it was too far to go back into Kelheim to drink and as we are staying at a brewery, we may as well just spend the evening here in the bar. We think we got through 11 wheat beers between us and it was another enjoyable evening.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 18th June</span>
          We checked out of where we were staying at 10:25..... exactly 12 hours before our flight to Tbilisi tonight. There was not a lot that we wanted to do today so left the car in the car park and walked into Kelheim again. Roz sat in a cafe in the centre while I continued walking up the hill to the Befreiungshalle (Liberation Hall). We have seen this in the distance a few times (and could see it from our bedroom window the last two nights) but had never walked up to it. It was nothing too spectacular but a nice enough walk anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          Back in the centre, I collected Roz and we walked back to the car. It was a drive of an hour and twenty minutes to the Besucherpark at the airport where we have paid to leave the car for the next three weeks. We left it in a multi-story car park with the bikes attached and walked half a mile to the S-Bahn station. We got the train to the airport where we arrived about seven and a half hours before our flight. We found somewhere to sit in Terminal 2 and Roz went to buy lunch from the supermarket in Terminal 1.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a reasonable place to sit - it had power sockets, a table, free WiFi and was in a relatively quiet part of the airport. We ate our lunch there and spent the remainder of the afternoon there taking it in turns to go for walks around the airport and sorting out photos from the fist part of this trip.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At about 6:40 we decided it was time for a beer. We went to Airbrau which is usually excellent. Beer was still very cheap here and we got a good table but after waiting to get served for over ten minutes, we gave up and left. The beer in the other beer garden was a lot more expensive so instead, we went to Edeka and bought a couple of beers and walked up to the area outside departures where we could sit on a wall. This area was fine for drinking a couple of bottles so I had another couple of trips to Edeka before we went through to our gate. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Getting through the airport was fairly quick and we were sat outside our gate about an hour before departure. The plane departed just about on time at 10:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 19th June</span>
          We landed on time in Tbilisi at 4:15am (two hours ahead of German time) after managing to get about an hours sleep. We got straight off the plane and through immigration in about 10 minutes. The arrivals area was packed with taxi drivers and was all a bit chaotic. We took money out of an ATM and also changed €10 into "GELs" so that we would have change for the bus. We then walked along to the arrivals area which was a bit more civilised and had an information desk.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We found out that the first bus into Tbilisi was not until 7am and that we would be able to use our UK bank cards on it. We were in no desperate hurry to get to our hotel as we would be unlikely to check in so early so we found somewhere to sit and wait. Food at the airport was ridiculously priced so breakfast consisted of biscuits bought with us from Munich.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The bus left on time and took about 45 minutes to drop us in Freedom Square. In the centre of the square, we did see the first evidence of the fact that there is a football tournament being played here. From here, it was a 10 minute walk to Hotel Terrace where we have a room booked for the next three nights. We could not have our room at this time but we were able to leave our bags and were told the room would be ready some time after 12.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went for much needed breakfast.  We went back to Freedom Square and then returned down the road we had just walked up to Entree where we had our first khachapuri (cheese pie) of the trip. We then spent an hour or so walking round the old town. It was all very nice with interesting buildings, shops and bars although all a bit dead at this time of morning. We crossed the river and came back on Peace Bridge but most of the time it was just a matter of wandering round looking at the old buildings.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We got back to the hotel at about 9:45 and both fell asleep in the comfortable chairs in the garden. We were woken at about 10:30 to be told our room was ready. We both had showers and went straight back to sleep again until woken by my alarm at 12:30. We went out about an hour later for lunch, and a first look at the sights. We ate at a restaurant just up the road from our hotel (I think we are going to enjoy the food here) and walked back up to Freedom Square. We walked back round a different way stopping off at Meiden Bazar on the way which had an excellent range of tacky souvenirs as well as all the traditional stuff. All quite nice again with a lot more people about than this morning.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We spent a couple of hours back in the hotel trying not to fall asleep and went out to eat just after 8. Their is a couple of rows of restaurants on a narrow lane running parallel to the street we are on. It is a bit more touristy than where we had lunch but a nice area anyway. We chose a restaurant at random and both had the khinkali, spicy dumpling type things that are another specialty of Georgia.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We were both worn out by now having had no-where near enough sleep last night and much too much beer in the last week. We did take a longer route home and crossed the Peace Bridge again for views of the old town lit up but were still back at the hotel by 9:15. Neither of us could be bothered to stay awake for the England game which due to the time difference did not kick off until 10:45.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 20th June</span>
          Woke up feeling a lot better than we had done yesterday after a good ten hours sleep. The weather on the other hand was the worst it had been since we left home. We knew the forecast for this week was not great and today was grey and cloudy with the threat of rain. We had a few things to sort out before our sight-seeing so this was not too big a problem. We wanted to buy a couple of train tickets for later in the week and also had decided to buy tickets for the opening game in the tournament tomorrow night. As the ground is few minutes walk away from the main station, we decided to head out there and get both sets of tickets at the same time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We left the hotel just after 9:30 and walked beck to Freedom Square. We got the metro from here. As with most European metro systems, it was cheaper, faster and easier to use than the one in London. We bought our "MetroMoney" cards and got the metro three stops up to station square. Once we had found our way into the station, buying tickets was very straightforward. We had already bought our tickets to Batumi for Thursday but needed a return from Batumi to Kutaisi for England's second game.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After buying the tickets, we walked towards the ground where tomorrows opening game will be played. We stopped for breakfast on the way (khachapuri again). While we were eating it started raining quite heavily. We stayed where we were after eating until it had stopped and then walked to the ground which was about five minutes walk away. The ground or the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena to give it it's full name is the home of Dinamo Tbilisi and also the national stadium. We walked all the way round the ground but security was quite tight and there was no way we were going in. We found the ticket office and bought two tickets for tomorrow's game for £3 each. We do not usually bother with non-England games but at £3 a ticket thought we may as well go to this one.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Despite the weather not improving much we thought we may as go ahead with Lonely Planet's walking tour. We walked from the ground to the start of the tour at Rustaveli Metro. The tour took us down from there back to Liberty Square passing several notable buildings including the parliament on the way. We also stopped at the Magticom shop where Roz bought a SIM card to use for the rest of the trip.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At Liberty Square, we returned into the old town and walked through more windy streets filled with old buildings. The tour continued onto Friendship Bridge but we gave up at that point and returned to Liberty Square. At this point we split up. Roz wanted to go and buy shampoo and I had a change of mind and returned to the Magticom so I could also get a SIM (or eSIM in my case). At GEL22 for 5GB it seemed a good buy. We had lunch on the terrace of the hotel and returned to the room for showers.

          We went out again at 5. There are a few craft beer pubs in the area near to where we are staying. We walked half a mile to the first one, Tsota Tsota. This was probably the best of the ones we went into. We tried the three different IPAs they had before moving on. The next one, Sma Craft Beer Bar, also looked very good but for reasons we never established, was only serving beer in plastic glasses. It was raining quite heavily by this time but we decided to move on  anyway. Next on the list was Abragi. We had a couple of beers there and decided it was time to go and eat.

          We walked back to the restaurant we had eaten in last night, Kala, and had a couple of plates of dumplings again. This time we had a litre of wine with our meal. After we had eaten, we stayed in there watching the end of the first Ashes test on my phone before walking back to the hotel.

          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 21st June - Georgia v Portugal</span>
          We woke late again and left the hotel at 10. We had breakfast at a cafe over the road and then started on the rest of our sight-seeing. We crossed the river and walked past the presidential palace and up to the Holy Trinity Cathedral. This was only built about 20 years ago. The outside was quite spectacular although the inside was a bit bland compared to some churches we have been into recently.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked down from there and through Rike Park to the place where the Aerial Tramway starts from. This is a cable car that takes you across the river and up the Narikala Fortress. The fortress itself is nothing too interesting but the views during the two minute cable car journey were excellent as were the views from the top. We walked out to the Mother Georgia statue, climbed up part of the inside of the fortress and then walked down the hill into the old town. We were back in the hotel by 1:15.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went back out again two hours later. It was about an hours walk to the ground and we decided to walk with a few stops on the way. First stop was somewhere selling Paulaner just round the corner from the hotel. We had a drink here and a plate of khinkali. We then retraced the route of yesterday's walking tour and stopped for another beer on the main road. We were heading vaguely in the direction of a brewery near the ground when we found a nice restaurant/bar advertising craft beer. We were only 2km from the ground at this stage so had a few in there with some more food. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Up until this point, we had still not seen a single football fan since we arrived here. However, as we got to within 1km, the crowds started to build and for the first time you could tell that there was a match being played. We had one more drink before going in. The queues to get in were longer than expected but our gate was not too bad and we were in before the anthems started. The ground had a reasonable amount of people in it - about 25,000 apparently and the atmosphere was good.

          We had not expected to much from the game but it was quite entertaining and the fact that Georgia won against the odds added to the enjoyment. We stayed until the final whistle and then went back to Station Square and got the metro back to Liberty Square. Back in the hotel by about 10:30. It had been a good way to end our stay in Tbilisi which has been an excellent place to visit.
