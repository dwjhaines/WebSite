          It was back to Tbilisi today. We had not managed to get tickets for the 8am train so were not leaving Batumi until 5:15pm. We were not in any hurry to leave the apartment so asked for a 12:30 checkout which they let us have.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we left, we got a taxi to the Old City Hotel and left our bags there for a few hours. We will be staying there next week and the couple we had spoken to last night had said this would be OK. We walked from there to the base of the Argo Cable Car. This is a 2.5km cable car ride from the port area of Batumi. There is nothing in particular to see at the top, it is there purely for the views.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          This was an excellent thing to do. Initially as we went up, we could see all of the old town and the sights along the coast. As we went higher, we could see the whole of Batumi. We spent about 20 minutes at the top taking photos before making the return journey. This was definitely one of the highlights of the trip so far.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After going to see the kittens, we walked back towards the hotel and stopped for lunch just before we got there. We collected our bags and got another taxi to the station where we had about an hour to wait for our train. This train was not as comfortable as the previous ones... at least not for me. We did not have seats together. Roz was sat in one of the airline seats next to a woman who gave her tea and biscuits. I was sat in a group of four seats in amongst a large group of large German fans so did not have quite as much space as usual. It was not to bad, however, and we got into Tbilisi just before the scheduled arrival time at 10:20.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got the metro one stop further than Liberty Square to Avlabari which is slightly closer to our next hotel. We had a walk of about 15 minutes to get to the Meiden View Hotel, which is a few minutes walk up the hill from Meiden Square. We checked in just after 11pm and were shown to a huge room with a big balcony and superb views of the old town.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had planned to have showers and go straight to bed but it seemed a shame not to spend some time on the balcony. I went out to try and buy wine but no-where sold cold white so ended up with a couple of bottles of beer instead. Finally got to bed just after 1am. A very good day for views!
        </p>

        <span class="diary-date">Friday 30th June</span>
          We had breakfast at 9 and headed out for more sight-seeing at 10:30. Most of the things we wanted to see we have either seen or can see them from our balcony so there is not too much more we wanted to do. We decided to head out to Mtskheta for a day trip. This involved walking back to Avlabari, getting the metro to Didube and then a Marshrutky (minibus) to Mtskheta. Total travel time about 90 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Mtskheta is Georgia's "Spiritual Heart" and is a nice little place with a few things to see. We were dropped off by one of the two top sights, the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. This was all quite interesting and is supposedly the resting place of Christ's robe! After wandering round this both inside and out, we walked up to the Samtavro Church which was also OK.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The second "top sight" is the Jvari Church, which is on a hill top overlooking Mtskheta but about 11km away by road. We were undecided about whether or not to go up there but found a taxi that would take us for ₾20 return plus half an hour up there so thought we may as well. This church was not as spectacular but was nice enough and the views did make the trip worth doing. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Sight-seeing completed, we did the same journey in reverse but got off the metro at Liberty Square. We walked down past where we stayed last time to buy wine and beer for tonight and lobiani for a late lunch on the balcony. I went out for another walk around the souvenir shops after lunch looking for a cork screw but returned to the room just as a heavy thunder storm was starting.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We started drinking at 6:30. We had bought a few bottles as we wanted to have a few drinks on our balcony but the storm meant we had to start the session in the room. The room has huge full length windows so it did not make a lot of difference and by about 7:00 the rain had stopped and we could move outside again. We had a couple of bottles of a locally brewed pale ale which was excellent and then moved onto the wine. The Georgian white wines are not great in our opinion but the red was fine.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out at 8:30 and returned to Kala for more khinkali and another litre of wine. After eating, we bought a couple more beers and returned to the balcony to drink those and the end of our wine.

          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 1st July - Georgia v Israel</span>
          We had bought tickets for todays quarter final. When Georgia won their group, the game was moved from its original venue, the Meskhi Stadium, to the larger Dinamo Arena. We were notified by email and told that we would receive new tickets the day before the game. We have still not received them and apparently we are being told just to turn up at the ground with the original tickets and we will be able to get in. Not much we can do about it but wait and see. 
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another late breakfast and went out for a walk at 11:30. We visited a couple of churches that we had not yet been to and then spent some time wandering round the area with the thermal baths which was all quite interesting. After an ice-cream, we returned to the room for a couple of hours.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at 3:00. We stopped for a wheat beer at the Paulaner place near where we stayed before. While in here, Roz noticed that we had actually been issued with new tickets but they  had not notified us. When following the link in the original email it gave us tickets for the correct stadium which was good news.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked from there to a restaurant that had been recommended to us for the "best khinkali in Georgia". The restaurant, Zodiaqo, was quite big but was packed when we got there. We did not know if others would be joining us but were only able to get a table for two. As it was, no-one else came! Not only was the food very good here but they had nice beer. We stayed for a couple of hours getting through 15 khinkali and a few of their unfiltered beers. This is the only place we have been to that serve fried khinkali and they really were excellent.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After leaving the restaurant, we stopped for one in Poddon Bar, a craft beer place and then made our way to the metro. We got to the ground with plenty of time to spare and had no problems getting in with our new tickets. We met Phil inside the ground and went to our seats in time for the anthems.

        <p class="diary-text">
          The first half of the game was terrible but the second was more enjoyable and we then had the excitement of extra time and penalties. Not bad value for £3 each and for England's chances of reaching the final, this was probably the best result. We got the metro back with Phil but he continued past Liberty Square to where he is staying. We bought a few more beers and went and sat on our balcony for a final time.

          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 2nd July - England v Portugal</span>
          When we were walking away from the ground last night, Phil mentioned that he had heard that there could be disruption to todays trains due a landslide between Batumi and Kutaisi. We were booked on the 8am train to Kutaisi so were up at 6:30. We had no way of finding information about the trains so had no option really but to go to station to see what was happening. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we got to the station, there was obviously a problem as there were a lot of people standing around all over the place. The departures board showed that all trains were running on time. However when we went down to the platform, there was no sign of any trains. The trains always start boarding 30 minutes before departure so the fact that our train was not even there by that time was not good. After asking around a couple of people we established that there were no trains running to Kutaisi this morning and we were going to have to find an alternative means of transport.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We could have probably got a taxi for £50 - £60 but the minibus on Friday had not been too bad so we decided to get the metro back to Didube and see what was available. Whereas on Friday it took us a while to find a minibus going to where we wanted to go, today the first one we saw when we came out of the metro had Kutaisi on it. We got two of the last few empty seats and it departed about ten minutes later just after 8:00.

        <p class="diary-text">
          The journey was OK. It was never going to be as comfortable as the train but we had seats and enough legroom. We had one ten minute toilet stop about half way there and were moved to a second minibus for the last twenty miles or so but were still dropped in Kutaisi slightly earlier than if the trains had been running. We had a 3km walk to our apartment and were able to let ourselves in as soon as we got there.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          This apartment was on the other side of the river to where we stayed last week and was a much nicer place to stay. It is a lot more modern, there is more space and we have a balcony right above the river. We had lunch in the apartment and spent the afternoon catching up on sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out at 4 and this time went straight to the Weihenstephan beer hall. This was by far my favourite place to drink the last time we were here and it was too hot for walking round looking for anywhere else. We were joined in there by Carl and Cath and got a taxi to the ground at 7:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
          This was not as good a game for England as the previous three but they still managed to win without conceding and now have what should be an easier match against Israel in the semi-final. We met up with the others after the final whistle and eventually got a taxi back to the beer hall. Carl and Cath had one drink in there as they have to leave early tomorrow morning. We stayed longer and watched the Ukraine knock France out of the tournament.... which I think is more good news for England. Ended up more pissed than we had planned to be.
