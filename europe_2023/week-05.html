          It was back to Tbilisi today. We had not managed to get tickets for the 8am train so were not leaving Batumi until 5:15pm. We were not in any hurry to leave the apartment so asked for a 12:30 checkout which they let us have.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we left, we got a taxi to the Old City Hotel and left our bags there for a few hours. We will be staying there next week and the couple we had spoken to last night had said this would be OK. We walked from there to the base of the Argo Cable Car. This is a 2.5km cable car ride from the port area of Batumi. There is nothing in particular to see at the top, it is there purely for the views.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          This was an excellent thing to do. Initially as we went up, we could see all of the old town and the sights along the coast. As we went higher, we could see the whole of Batumi. We spent about 20 minutes at the top taking photos before making the return journey. This was definitely one of the highlights of the trip so far.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After going to see the kittens, we walked back towards the hotel and stopped for lunch just before we got there. We collected our bags and got another taxi to the station where we had about an hour to wait for our train. This train was not as comfortable as the previous ones... at least not for me. We did not have seats together. Roz was sat in one of the airline seats next to a woman who gave her tea and biscuits. I was sat in a group of four seats in amongst a large group of large German fans so did not have quite as much space as usual. It was not to bad, however, and we got into Tbilisi just before the scheduled arrival time at 10:20.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got the metro one stop further than Liberty Square to Avlabari which is slightly closer to our next hotel. We had a walk of about 15 minutes to get to the Meiden View Hotel, which is a few minutes walk up the hill from Meiden Square. We checked in just after 11pm and were shown to a huge room with a big balcony and superb views of the old town.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had planned to have showers and go straight to bed but it seemed a shame not to spend some time on the balcony. I went out to try and buy wine but no-where sold cold white so ended up with a couple of bottles of beer instead. Finally got to bed just after 1am. A very good day for views!
        </p>

        <span class="diary-date">Friday 30th June</span>
          We had breakfast at 9 and headed out for more sight-seeing at 10:30. Most of the things we wanted to see we have either seen or can see them from our balcony so there is not too much more we wanted to do. We decided to head out to Mtskheta for a day trip. This involved walking back to Avlabari, getting the metro to Didube and then a Marshrutky (minibus) to Mtskheta. Total travel time about 90 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Mtskheta is Georgia's "Spirital Heart" and is a nice little place with a few things to see. We were dropped off by one of the two top sights, the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. This was all quite interesting and is supposedly the resting place of Christ's robe! After wandering round this both inside and out, we walked up to the Samtavro Church which was also OK.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
          border="0"
          width=100%;
          src="images/georgia_020.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The second "top sight" is the Jvari Church, which is on a hill top overlooking Mtskheta but about 11km away by road. We were undecided about whether or not to go up there but found a taxi that would take us for â‚¾20 return plus half an hour up there so thought we may as well. This church was not as spectacular but was nice enough and the views did make the trip worth doing. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Sight-seeing completed, we did the same journey in reverse but got off the metro at Liberty Square. We walked down past where we stayed last time to by wine and beer for tonight and lobiani for a late lunch on the balcony.
