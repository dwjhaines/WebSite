          Woke up to bad weather this morning. We have been pretty fortunate with the weather for the last eight weeks. Even this week, the forecast had been terrible but it has not really been too bad. However, today it was grey and drizzly and did not look as if it was going to clear. Our plans for a bike ride were knocked on the head.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked out to Panos for breakfast and then returned to the hotel for an hour or so. By midday the rain had eased sufficiently for us to venture outside the hotel again. We walked round the main squares in the drizzle and located the B&B where we will all be staying in December. We decided that it would be a good idea to eat something else before starting today's drinking so had a McDonalds before walking back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At 2:30, we went down to the hotel bar for our welcome drink. They are a bit more generous here than they were in the Luxembourg Ibis and we had a Chimay Blue and a Gentse Strop accompanied by cheese and peanuts. After these, we walked to the Trappistenhuis. Still one of the best bars in Belgium! We were in here for over three hours and things are already starting to get a bit hazy by the time we left.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked back into the centre after leaving. Trollekelder was still closed so we went back to Dulle Griet. We were only going to have one in here but after a couple of Achels, we were unable to resist the temptation of the 1.2 litre Kwak glasses. After one of these between us, things become very vague in my memory. It would appear that we went to 't Dreupelkot for one, had at least one in Het Waterhuis, another in 't Dreupelkot and a final drink of the day in 't Galgenhuis.

          Roz was feeling quite rough today so we had a bit of a later start than usual. I went out and bought breakfast from Panos and we did not leave the hotel until 11:45. We had a ride of 25 miles to get to Aalst where we are staying for the next two nights. Once again it was an easy ride although Roz found the first half of it tough going!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived in Aalst at about 2:30 and checked into yet another Ibis. We dropped our bags in the room and walked back to a supermarket to buy lunch which we ate sat on a near-by bench. We did not do much for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked into the centre of Aalst at 6. We had chosen Aalst as Brussels hotels were very expensive this weekend (possibly due to the Belgian Grand Prix) and it is not that far away. The town itself was quite nice with a few things to see. There were also plenty of places that looked good for drinking but tonight was a much needed day off alcohol. After a walk round the main square, we ate at a kebab shop before walking back to the hotel

        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 29th July</span>
          We had considered going into Brussels today but as we were driving past Aalst on June 1st, we noticed that it was close to Affligem and decided to cycle out to the Abbey there instead. We had assumed that there was a brewery there as well as the abbey but it appears that they no longer brew the beer there. However, there is still the Gasthof De Brouwerij in the grounds of the abbey so we decided it was worth a visit anyway. We walked to the supermarket again for breakfast and provisions for tomorrows bike ride and returned to the room to plan our route.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The weather was not great again today. It rained a lot in the morning and in the end we decided to wait until the lunch break in the cricket before going out at 2pm. We had chosen a circular route that would get us to Affligem after about 15 miles leaving us with five more miles to do when we left the Gasthof. We managed to lose the route once on the way extending the ride by a couple of miles but it all went roughly to plan.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The Gasthof was another very nice place to drink. We tried a couple of their beers and we shared a "breugel platter", a selection of meats and cheese. After these, we cycled back to the hotel managing to avoid the heaviest of the showers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were back in the hotel at 6:25, had showers and walked back into the centre of town. We stopped for a drink at "The Fox" which is supposedly an English pub. However, once inside, it was very nice with a decent range of Belgian beers. It was also very popular with the locals as it was totally full apart from seats at the bar. We had one in there and continued walking into town to a pizza restaurant we had walked past yesterday. We both had pizzas with another beer.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          After eating, we had another walk round town, took euros out of the cash-point (mainly for use in Greece) and returned to the hotel. We had our welcome drink in reception (my first Westmalle Tripel of the trip) before having an early and relatively sober night. When we arrived in Aalst, it had seemed a bit of an anti-climax after Bruges and Ghent but it has been an ideal place to spend a couple of days recovering from the previous few days of heavy drinking.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 30th July</span>
          The last day of this two month trip. We had originally planned to get the train back from Aalst to Bruges today but had instead decided to cycle it. The rides to get to Aalst had both been very easy and we thought it would be a good thing to do before our last day of drinking.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were up at 7, checked out of the hotel and set off on our bikes just before 7:30. The ride today was harder than the two coming the other way because of a strong head wind that we were cycling into for most of the 55 mile journey.
         </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a few stops on the way for rests, breakfast, photos in Ghent and finally to eat the ends of last nights pizza. We arrived in Bruges just before 2 and checked back into the Ibis that we had left a few days ago.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After showers, we went down for another welcome drink in the hotel bar. They have proved to be very good value during our stays in Ibis hotels in the last week or so. After our drinks, we walked into the centre looking for something to eat. The chip shop that Roz wanted to go to was closed so we walked back to Fritbar near the hotel. After our chips and another beer, we headed back to 't Brugs Beertje. It started raining quite heavily while in here so we ended up staying for just over three hours and think we got through eight beers between us.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          When we did finally leave, we headed to Cambrinus Cafe which was closed again. We walked round the corner to Le Trappiste but this was also closed so we went back across the square to De Gare. This did not work out too badly as I was keen to go in here and it looked as if we were going to miss it due to too many in 't Brugs Beertje! After a couple of house triples in here, we walked back to the hotel and were in bed by about 9:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 31st July</span>
          We checked out of the hotel by 8:00 and cycled in the rain back to the car in the station car park. Roz went and bought breakfast while I attached the bike to the car and we were on our way towards Calais by 8:30. We stopped at Adinkerke as usual to stock up on beer and also at a Carrefour in Calais for wine.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were booked on the 12:05 ferry and got to the port before 11:00. We were told that we would not be able to get on the ferry due to queues at French immigration and were given a place on the 13:40 instead. However the queues moved relatively quickly and we were able to get on the 12:05 with plenty of time to spare.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The ferry was a bit late getting in due to the rough weather but we were still back in Dover just before 1pm. We had our usual stop at Cheriton Tesco for lunch and petrol and then had the worst journey we have had in the last two months to get home. Eventually got back to Kingsclere at 4:20.
