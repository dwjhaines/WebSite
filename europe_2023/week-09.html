          Woke up to bad weather this morning. We have been pretty fortunate with the weather for the last eight weeks. Even this week, the forecast had been terrible but it has not really been too bad. However, today it was grey and drizzly and did not look as if it was going to clear. Our plans for a bike ride were knocked on the head.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked out to Panos for breakfast and then returned to the hotel for an hour or so. By midday the rain had eased sufficiently for us to venture outside the hotel again. We walked round the main squares in the drizzle and located the B&B where we will all be staying in December. We decided that it would be a good idea to eat something else before starting today's drinking so had a McDonalds before walking back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At 2:30, we went down to the hotel bar for our welcome drink. They are a bit more generous here than they were in the Luxembourg Ibis and we had a Chimay Blue and a Gentse Strop accompanied by cheese and peanuts. After these, we walked to the Trappistenhuis. Still one of the best bars in Belgium! We were in here for over three hours and things are already starting to get a bit hazy by the time we left.

          We walked back into the centre after leaving. Trollekelder was still closed so we went back to Dulle Griet. We were only going to have one in here but after a couple of Achels, we were unable to resist the temptation of the 1.2 litre Kwak glasses. After one of these between us, things become very vague in my memory. It would appear that we went to 't Dreupelkot for one, had at least one in Het Waterhuis, another in 't Dreupelkot and a final drink of the day in 't Galgenhuis.

          Roz was feeling quite rough today so we had a bit of a later start than usual. I went out and bought breakfast from Panos and we did not leave the hotel until 11:45. We had a ride of 25 miles to get to Aalst where we are staying for the next two nights. Once again it was an easy ride although Roz found the first half of it tough going!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived in Aalst at about 2:30 and checked into yet another Ibis. We dropped our bags in the room and walked back to a supermarket to buy lunch which we ate sat on a near-by bench. We did not do much for the rest of the afternoon.

          We walked into the centre of Aalst at 6. We had chosen Aalst as Brussels hotels were very expensive this weekend (possibly due to the Belgian Grand Prix) and it is not that far away. The town itself was quite nice with a few things to see. There were also plenty of places that looked good for drinking but tonight was a much needed day off alcohol. After a walk round the main square, we ate at a kebab shop before walking back to the hotel
