          We were up at 4:30 and left Kingsclere at exactly 5:00. There were a few delays due to roadworks and the particularly unnecessary "Operation Stack" on the M20 but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at Dover before 7:30. The queues to get through French immigration were not too bad and we had checked in for the 8:25 P&O ferry to Calais by about 7:40. We had been told that there was a delay of about 20 minutes. We started boarding at 8:25 and did leave about 20 minutes later. We had breakfast on the ferry and arrived in Calais at about 11:30. By midday, we were on the motorway heading towards Belgium and Germany.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were heading for Aachen again. We had a couple of stops on the way. One to drop off our empties in Adinkerke and one at a service station after Brussels for lunch. There were a few holdups along the way but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor in Aachen at about 4:30.

          We dropped our stuff off in the room and went back down for our first beer of the trip in the hotel "beer garden". After that, we headed into town stopping for one in the Goldenes Schwein on the way. We called in for one at Poststübchen and ended up staying in there for a few. It is a nice pub type place with good music and cheap beer. We walked from there to Zum goldenen Einhorn where we had a couple more then one in each of the Ratskeller and the Domkeller. We had not eaten anything so were quite pissed and back in the hotel by 10pm.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 2nd June</span>
          A slightly later start today as we did not get up until 10. We checked out of the hotel at 11, left the car in the car park and went for a walk around Aachen. We had breakfast in a bakery near the Novotel and then walked through the centre past the Rathaus and Cathedral. We were back at the hotel by about 12:10 and on our way again about five minutes later. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a drive of just over 100 miles to get to Trier today. A lot of the journey was on single carriageway roads so it was a bit slower than some trips but we were still at the B&B in Trier by about 3:30. We put our stuff in the room and went straight out on our bikes for a few hours. We cycled through the centre and down to the Moselle where we joined the Moselle cycle path. We will be starting a five day trip along the river to Koblenz tomorrow so today headed up-river in the other direction. We cycled about 11 miles to Wasserbillig, just over the Luxembourg border. After looking round the town for about ten minutes trying unsuccessfully to find an ice-cream shop we gave up and cycled back to Trier.

          After showers, we walked back into the centre of Trier. We had a look at Porta Nigra which is the main sight in the city. From there we walked through the pedestrianised bit to the cathedral. We were getting hungry by this time. As we left the cathedral area, we found a burger place that quite appealed. We had excellent burgers with just the one beer and walked back to the hotel.

          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 3rd June - Trier to Trittenheim - 27.9 miles - 321 ft</span>
          We were up by 9ish and spent half an hour or so sorting out our stuff for the next five days. Everything we needed to take with us was put into the panniers and the rest in bags to be left in the car. After attaching everything to the bikes, we left the hotel at about 9:40. We cycled back into the centre and had breakfast on seats by Porta Nigra.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After eating, we followed the cycle route back to the river and the Moselradweg. We were heading for Trittenheim which is only about 13 miles away from Trier in a straight line. However, this section of the Moselle is quite windy so sticking to the river path makes it a journey of about 28 miles. It was a very pleasant ride. The route did have the odd section through industrial areas or along main roads but the vast majority of it was along the river or through the vineyards. The vineyards on the steep hills were quite spectacular in places and together with all the weinguts and wine gardens along the way, they made us quite keen to start drinking wine by the time we arrived in Trittenheim!

        <p class="diary-text">
          Unusually, the journey was slightly shorter than expected and we arrived in Trittenheim at about 1:20. We had a room booked at "Gästehaus Annette Hermes-Hoffmann" and were able to check in as soon as we arrived. We dropped off our luggage and went straight out to look for something for lunch. Trittenheim is a nice little town but  it does not have many shops and any that it does have were by now closed for the weekend. The Esso garage near our Gästehaus did have a small shop so we were able to buy food but there were not too many other options. We ate on our balcony which just about overlooks the river before having showers and an afternoon of not doing a lot.

        <p class="diary-text">
          The F.A. Cup Final kicked off at 4pm but it took us until half way through the second half to find the WiFi password. We watched the end of the match and started on the wine at 6. Our fridge contained nine bottles of wine from the winery attached to the guest house. We took one of the cheaper ones and sat on the terrace that we share with the other room here. It was a very nice spot with great views of the river and vineyards on the other side. After finishing that we walked into the centre of Trittenheim.

          We had been told that we would need to reserve a table if we wanted to eat out tonight. This had confused us as there did not seem to be that many people around but once in the centre we found that all but a couple of the restaurants were closed meaning that the ones that were open were quite full. We had booked a table at Pizza Pinochio for 8pm but ended up getting there earlier. We had planned to stop for a drink on the way there but there was no-where open that we wanted to stop at. We had good pizzas with more wine and then returned to the room for another bottle while joining the video chat.

          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 4th June - Trittenheim to Zeltingen-Rachtig - 23.5 miles - 437 ft</span>
          After eating the included breakfast, we loaded up the bikes and were on our way again by 10:00. We crossed the river and rejoined the Radweg. It was another enjoyable ride. There were a few more small towns to cycle through today and plenty of time along the river and through the vineyards again.

          We were not expecting to be able to get into our apartment until 2pm. We had already reached Bernkastel, a few miles away by midday so stopped there for an hour or so. We found a bench with good views of the river and sat and had ice-creams. We then took it in turns to wander round what was a very picturesque little town. We headed off again just after 1 and arrived in Zeltingen-Rachtig at about 1:30. We were able to get straight into the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another afternoon of not doing much until just before 4 when we headed out to Brauhaus Kloster Machern, a brewery that I had read about a few weeks ago. It was a walk of about a mile through the town of Zeltingen and then across the river. We initially sat outside in the wine garden and had a couple of beers there. This was all very nice but we eventually realised that we were not in the main part of the brewery. The brewery had another large garden but we chose to sit inside the main building.

          This was a superb room. We stayed in there for a few hours both of us having excellent schnitzels accompanied by plenty of their wheat beer. We had seven beers between us and were given a free one to take away in my souvenir stein when we paid the bill. A very enjoyable evening!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We left the brewery by about 7:30 and walked back over the river to Zeltingen. We stopped for one more beer and then bought a bottle of wine which we drank on our terrace. We were asleep by about 9:30.

          <span class="diary-date">Monday 5th June - Zeltingen-Rachtig to Bullay - 27.0 miles - 307 ft</span>
          Roz went out to buy food for breakfast which we ate before leaving the apartment. We left just after 9:30 and had another easy ride of 27 miles to Bullay. As with yesterday, we would have got to our guest house too early so we stopped for about an hour at Zell. We had ice-creams and both went for walks round the town before completing the final four miles to Bullay. We found our way to Gästehaus Spies at 1:15 and were able to check in straight away. We have another room with a balcony that looks over the town and down to the river.

          We left our stuff in the room and walked to a supermarket to buy food for lunch which we ate on the balcony. Bullay was not quite as scenic as some of the places we have been through in the last couple of days but a nice enough place to stop for the night nonetheless. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The afternoon was spent lazing around either on the balcony or in the room. We went out again at 6. We walked to the bridge, crossed the river again and walked along to Alf, the town on the other side of the river to Bullay. There was not too much to see here so we walked back again and ate at a kebab shop in the small square near where we are staying. We were back at our room before 8. First alcohol free day of the trip.

          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 6th June - Bullay to Treis-Karden - 28.3 miles - 155 ft</span>
          Due to the lack of alcohol yesterday, we had a slightly earlier start today. We left the guest house just after 8:30 and cycled to the supermarket to buy food for breakfast. We crossed the river again and cycled to Alf where we found a bench to eat it on. As with the previous days, it was a very easy enjoyable ride. We cycled through the area that has apparently the steepest vineyards in Europe and several picturesque little towns. The highlight was probably Cochem with the Reichsburg Castle high above a town packed with gabled houses and a Baroque style town hall.

          We arrived in Treis-Karden just after midday and were able to check straight into a very nice apartment at Weinstube Castor. After sorting our stuff out, we walked to the supermarket and bought food for lunch. We did not have a terrace or balcony here so after eating, we went back out on our bikes again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We wanted to cycle to Burg Eltz which was recommended in the Moselle Cycle Route guide that I had been reading. It sounded quite straightforward to get to. However, it involved a very steep climb (as much ascent as we have had in the last four days) and eventually a series of unsurfaced tracks. Roz was not happy with cycling off-road and we were thinking of giving up but we did eventually come to a view point where we could see the castle. It did look impressive but was still some distance away and lower down than we were.... which would have meant a fair bit more cycling uphill to get back if we had gone down to it. We settled for a few photos from where we were and returned to Treis-Karden - a round trip of 12.7 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After yesterday's night off, we started on the wine again just after 6pm. We had a glass in the room and then tried to find somewhere in the main square to have a drink. The only place with tables sold bottles of overpriced French wine so we went down to a beer garden by the river and had a few glasses there instead.. We returned to our weinstube to eat and had very good meals with another bottle of wine. We returned to the room for a few more glasses before bed.

          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 7th June - Treis-Karden to Koblenz - 33.4 miles - 421 ft</span>
          We had breakfast included with our room and left the apartment just after 10. This was the final leg of the Moselradweg as it ends where the Moselle flows into the Rhine at Koblenz. It was a similar ride to the previous days through plenty more vineyards and small scenic towns.

          We had a short break at Winningen and arrived at Deutsches Eck, the confluence of the two rivers at 1:30. After a few celebratory pictures we still had an hour and a half or so before we could check into our apartment so decided to go for a drink. The Maximillians Brewery which we have visited a couple of times was closed so we cycled three miles down The Rhine to another beer garden in front of the Koblenzer Brewery. We had a wheat beer and a schnitzel sandwich each and then cycled back to the old town.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had booked an apartment in Boardinghaus Aldstadt Koblenz. We had to lock our bikes up outside for the first time on this trip but once inside, it was a very nice apartment again.

          We went out for the evening at 5. We wandered round a few of Koblenz's sights - which mainly consisted of a few churches, a couple of squares and the "History Column". All quite nice without anything being too spectacular. We ended up by the Deutsches Eck again and this time went to the big beer garden of the same name. We had had our first rain of the trip while we were in the apartment this afternoon and although it was dry while we walked round the sights, there was a big thunder storm while we were in the beer garden. We were just about under cover so stayed there for a couple until it passed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We moved from the beer garden to Altes Brauhaus which had looked about the best place to drink in Koblenz. We had a few in there and a few more in another smaller pub type place. We were not bothered about having a big meal so stopped for a takeaway pizza on the way back to the apartment. We ate it with the remainder of yesterday's wine.
