          A long day of travelling today. We were up before 6, checked out of the hotel and cycled a couple of miles to Vienna Hauptbahnhof. We were travelling back to Passau and were booked onto the 7:28 train. The train left a couple of minutes late but was eight minutes late by the time we got to Linz. This meant that we just missed our connection and had to wait almost an hour for the next train to Passau. We would probably have struggled with the connection anyway. It was not that easy getting the bikes on and off the trains, the first train in particular. We had to change platforms which involved using lifts for the bikes, and the bike compartment on the first train was at the very front of the train - a long way from the centre of the station. To have done this in 7 minutes would have been a struggle but as it was the second train had departed before we had even arrived in Linz. We eventually got the 9:50 (instead of the 8:50) and arrived back in Passau 58 minutes late at about 11:20.

        <p class="diary-text">
          When we did arrive in Passau, it was only a few minutes bike ride back to the car park and another few minutes to cycle up to the car. We sorted out our luggage, attached the bikes to the back of the car and were on our way again by about 11:45. We had a couple of stops before leaving Passau - one for petrol (and ice for the esky) and one at a supermarket for food for the journey. We were on our way towards Karlsruhe by 12:15. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had chosen Karlsruhe as a stopping point for a couple of nights as it is en-route from Passau to Luxembourg and we found an apartment a few km out of town that has both air-conditioning and a washing machine (we have a lot of dirty washing after the last couple of weeks). The journey itself was not too bad. We had one stop for lunch and a a couple of delays for roadworks, etc near the end but still made it to the apartment by 5:45. It had been a long day but we now have a big chunk of the drive home out of the way.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were met by the owner who let us in and showed us round another very nice and large apartment. We unloaded everything from the car and managed to get the cricket onto the tv. We watched that while unpacking, put on our first load of washing and then drove to the local ReWe to buy pizzas for tea. We ate them in the apartment with a few drinks and had a relatively early, sober night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 21st July</span>
          We were up quite early. I walked to the supermarket to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We did another couple of loads of washing and went out on our bikes at about 9:30. We are staying about three miles North of the centre of Karlsruhe. We cycled into the centre stopping a look round the Schloss on the way. This was the only sight that we were interested in that we did not see when we stayed here last year.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a short look round the centre, we cycled out towards the Rhine. This took us through some of the not so scenic parts of the city and into a large industrial area near the river. We did find the Rhineradweg and started heading North along it. We still did not see too much of the river but it was all nice enough anyway. I think we thne managed to lose the route but it was time to turn back by then anyway. We turned away from the river and followed another route back to Karlsruhe-Neureut, the area where we are staying.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had leftover pizza for lunch. We had planned to go not long after lunch but it was raining and the cricket was quite entertaining so we stayed in the apartment until 4. We went into the centre of Karlsruhe on the S-Bahn and then got another train out to Durlach, a few miles to the East. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We visited a few beer gardens starting at Obermühle which had been recommended in a guide book and then Alte Durlacher Brauerei. Neither of these were brilliant but Traube Dulach was a very nice garden to sit in so we stopped there for a couple. We then found another pub, Wirtshaus zum Kranz, with good seats outside it so stopped for a couple more. Things get a bit vague from here. We had not bothered eating anything and although we had not had that much to drink, were getting quite pissed.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          We made it to Vogel Hausbräu Durlach which was supposed to be our third stop. This is a very vague memory. It was time to go home after one in here but the journey took us more than two hours. I am not sure exactly what happened but we got on the wrong train, got off at the wrong station and then had problems working out which direction to walk in. Got back to the apartment just after 11.
