          A long day of travelling today. We were up before 6, checked out of the hotel and cycled a couple of miles to Vienna Hauptbahnhof. We were travelling back to Passau and were booked onto the 7:28 train. The train left a couple of minutes late and was eight minutes late by the time we got to Linz. This meant that we just missed our connection and had to wait almost an hour for the next train to Passau. We would probably have struggled with the connection anyway. It was not that easy getting the bikes on and off the trains, the first train in particular. We had to change platforms which involved using lifts for the bikes, and the bike compartment on the first train was at the very front of the train - a long way from the centre of the station. To have done this in 7 minutes would have been a struggle but as it was the second train had departed before we had even arrived in Linz. We eventually got the 9:50 (instead of the 8:50) and arrived back in Passau 58 minutes late at about 11:20.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we did arrive in Passau, it was only a few minutes bike ride back to the car park and another few minutes to cycle up to the car. We sorted out our luggage, attached the bikes to the back of the car and were on our way again by about 11:45. We had a couple of stops before leaving Passau - one for petrol (and ice for the esky) and one at a supermarket for food for the journey. We were on our way towards Karlsruhe by 12:15. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had chosen Karlsruhe as a stopping point for a couple of nights as it is en-route from Passau to Luxembourg and we found an apartment a few km out of town that has both air-conditioning and a washing machine (we have a lot of dirty washing after the last couple of weeks). The journey itself was not too bad. We had one stop for lunch and a a couple of delays for roadworks, etc near the end but still made it to the apartment by 5:45. It had been a long day but we now have a big chunk of the drive home out of the way.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were met by the owner who let us in and showed us round another very nice and large apartment. We unloaded everything from the car and managed to get the cricket onto the tv. We watched that while unpacking, put on our first load of washing and then drove to the local ReWe to buy pizzas for tea. We ate them in the apartment with a few drinks and had a relatively early, sober night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Friday 21st July</span>
          We were up quite early. I walked to the supermarket to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We did another couple of loads of washing and went out on our bikes at about 9:30. We are staying about three miles North of the centre of Karlsruhe. We cycled into the centre stopping a look round the Schloss on the way. This was the only sight that we were interested in that we did not see when we stayed here last year.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a short look round the centre, we cycled out towards the Rhine. This took us through some of the not so scenic parts of the city and into a large industrial area near the river. We did find the Rhineradweg and started heading North along it. We still did not see too much of the river but it was all nice enough anyway. I think we then managed to lose the route but it was time to turn back by then anyway. We turned away from the river and followed another route back to Karlsruhe-Neureut, the area where we are staying.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had leftover pizza for lunch. We had planned to go out not long after lunch but it was raining and the cricket was quite entertaining so we stayed in the apartment until 4. We went into the centre of Karlsruhe on the S-Bahn and then got another train out to Durlach, a few miles to the East. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We visited a few beer gardens starting at Obermühle which had been recommended in a guide book and then Alte Durlacher Brauerei. Neither of these were brilliant but Traube Durlach was a very nice garden to sit in so we stopped there for a couple. We then found another pub, Wirtshaus zum Kranz, with good seats outside it so stopped for a couple more. Things get a bit vague from here. We had not bothered eating anything and although we had not had that much to drink, were getting quite pissed.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We made it to Vogel Hausbräu Durlach which was supposed to be our third stop. This is a very vague memory. It was time to go home after one in here but the journey took us more than two hours. The train we wanted to catch did not turn up. I am not sure exactly what happened after this but we got on the wrong train, got off at the wrong station and then had problems working out which direction to walk in. Got back to the apartment just after 11.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 22nd July</span>
          We left the apartment just before 10:00. We had a drive of about three and a half hours today to get to Luxembourg City. We had never stayed in Luxembourg before and it is on our route back to Bruges so decided to give it a go for a couple of nights. We stopped at ReWe to buy food for breakfast and lunch and at a couple of other supermarkets looking for beer and were on our way out of Karlsruhe by 10:20.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We took the shorter cross country route to get to Luxembourg, had one stop for breakfast and arrived at the Luxembourg Airport Ibis at 1:45. This is the first of nine consecutive nights we will be staying in Ibis hotels.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a couple of hours in the room, we headed into the centre of Luxembourg City. We got the bus from outside the hotel and walked from where we were dropped off to the old town. The city is one of the most scenic in Europe and I am not really sure why we have never visited it previously. The old town is all quite nice and similar to a lot of German cities but it is the setting that makes the whole place so spectacular. Most of the city is at the top of a gorge covered in old fortifications.
        </p>
        <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked round the main buildings in the centre and then along the Chemin de la Corniche, a pedestrianised walkway that goes along the ramparts with views of the gorge below. We then walked down into the area of Grund at the bottom of the valley which was also very nice and a bit quieter. Once we had had enough of looking at the views, we headed for the Big Beer Company Brauerei. This was an excellent Bavarian style place with litre glasses of very good unfiltered beer. We had a few drinks in here and also our first taste of "Luxembourgish" food.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After the mess we made of getting home last night, we decided to start heading back a bit earlier tonight. We walked to The Pyg, an Irish pub that we had walked past earlier. After a couple in here we got a bus back to Cents which is about halfway back to the hotel. We had one more drink here before getting another bus back to the hotel. All public transport is completely free in Luxembourg so this was a very good way of visiting a few pubs.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were back in the hotel before 10, so got another couple of drinks from the bar and joined in the video call for an hour or so.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 23rd July</span>
          As there were not too many sights left that we wanted to see in the city, we decided on a trip out to Vianden today. The free public transport scheme includes trains so you can go anywhere in the country completely free of charge. We thought we may as well make the most of this.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got the bus from outside the hotel again at 11:20 and this time stayed on it all the way to the station. We got a train to Diekirch where we had a wait of about 20 minutes for the bus to Vianden. We only spent just over an hour in Vianden which was enough time to walk round the town and up to the castle We did not go into the castle as there was a long queue and it cost €10 each but it was a really nice little town and well worth the visit.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We got the bus back to Ettelbruck, a train from there back to Luxembourg and then the bus back to the hotel. Neither of us could be bothered to do much in the evening and there were not a lot of eating options near the hotel so we got the bus back into town and walked to McDonalds. We were back in the hotel before 8:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 24th July</span>
          We checked out of the hotel at 8:45, stopped at a supermarket to buy breakfast and were on our way by 9am. We had a stop at a motorway service station to eat breakfast but other than that, did the journey to Bruges non-stop. The weather today was terrible with the max speed down to about 40mph at some points due to the lack of visibility but the journey was still not too bad and we arrived at the station car-park in Bruges just before 1pm.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We spent ten minutes unloading the bikes and attaching the luggage and then had a short cycle ride to the Ibis that we stayed in twice last year. We were able to check in straight away and went out immediately for a look round the centre. We walked round the main square, established that Cambrinus Cafe was still closed, booked a table at Cambrinus Brasserie for tonight and checked that 't Brugs Beertje had not closed for the summer holidays. We bought lunch from Panos and ate it looking at a church before walking back to the hotel.

        <p class="diary-text">
          At 3, we walked back to the station to meet Louise who arrived at 3:30 from Amsterdam. We took her back to the hotel and got her checked in before going out to start the days drinking. We went first to FritBar as Louise hadn't eaten and then spent a couple of hours in 't Brugs Beertje - excellent as ever. We walked across the square to Cambrinus for 7 and had very good meals. It is the first time we have been in there while relatively sober and it was a very nice bar. We finished the evening with a few in Le Trappiste before walking back to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 25th July</span>
          Roz and Louise had breakfast in the hotel at 9. I went for a walk round the centre and bought breakfast from Panos. At 11, they both went off to do their sight-seeing while I went out for a 38 mile bike ride. I went out to the coast at Blankenberge, along the coast to Zeebrugge, back inland to Sluis and back into Bruges along the canal.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          I was back at the hotel by 2:30. By the time I had had a shower, Roz and Louise were also back. We went down to the hotel bar for our welcome drink and then walked to the Bourgogne des Flandres Brewery. We managed to get a table right next to the canal and as usual, it was an excellent place to spend the afternoon. The introduction of an alcohol free beer into the tasting flight was a bit of a disappointment but they had added a triple as well which just about made up for it. Overall, it was as good as ever.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
          Louise was not drinking today but was keen on eating. As the brewery was closing, we walked to Amunì Italian Restaurant where we had very good pizzas with a couple more beers. While walking here, we noticed that Cafe Cambrinus had reopened which was good news. We went back there for a couple more after eating and then returned to the area near the hotel. We got fed up of waiting to be served in one pub and the second we tried was closed so we gave up and had an early night. Back in the hotel just after 9:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 26th July</span>
          Once again, Roz and Loouise had breakfast in the hotel. I took a couple of things back to the car, collected our helmets and bought breakfast for myself. Just after 11, we said goodbye to Louise, checked out of the hotel and headed off on our bikes to Ghent.
        </p>

          This was an easy 30 mile ride mostly along the Bruges - Ghent Canal. We had planned to do this ride in 2020 but covid had meant that we were not able to enter Belgium. The route was flat and surfaced and easy to follow. We went wrong getting into Ghent so went a slightly longer route than we needed to. Cycling along the cobbled streets was not helped by the large crowds of tourists all over the place as well as having to negotiate the multiple tram lines, but by 2:15 we were at the Ibis Gent Centrum Opera. We left our bikes in the underground garage and were able to check in straight away. We had showers and went out to start drinking again.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We started at Het Waterhuis aan de Bierkant. All the tables outside were taken but we got a table inside. This was very good again (despite the missing hops!). We had a few drinks between us in there as well as some cheese and pate before moving nextdoor to 't Dreupelkot for a quick chocolate jenever. From there we walked back to 't Galgenhuis. Here, again all the outside tables were taken but the inside was empty. They sold Gentse Triple here which is excellent but not sold everywhere. We had five of these between us.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Next on the list was a stop at 't Kanon but this was closed so we went to Dulle Griet. Although touristy, this is still an excellent pub. We managed to resist the temptation of the 1.2 litre Kwak glasses and had a couple of Achel Blonds instead. The final place we wanted to visit was Trollekelder but this was closed for some reason. We returned to Het Waterhuis for a final few drinks before walking back to the hotel.
