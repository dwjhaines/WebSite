          A long day of travelling today. We were up before 6, checked out of the hotel and cycled a couple of miles to Vienna Hauptbahnhof. We were travelling back to Passau and were booked onto the 7:28 train. The train left a couple of minutes late but was eight minutes late by the time we got to Linz. This meant that we just missed our connection and had to wait almost an hour for the next train to Passau. We would probably have struggled with the connection anyway. It was not that easy getting the bikes on and off the trains, the first train in particular, we had to change platforms which involved using lifts for the bikes, and the bike compartment on the first train was at the very front of the train - a long way from the centre of the station. To have done this in 7 minutes would have been a struggle but as it was the second train had departed before we had even arrived in Linz. We eventually got the 9:50 (instead of the 8:50) and arrived back in Passau 58 minutes late at about 11:20.

        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we did arrive in Passau, it was a few minutes bike ride back to the car park and another few minutes to cycle up to the car. We sorted out our luggage, attached the bikes to the back of the car and were on our way again by about 11:45. We had a couple of stops before leaving Passau - one for petrol & ice for the esky and one at a supermarket for food for the journey. We were on our way towards Karlsruhe by 12:15.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had chosen Karlsruhe as a stopping point for a couple of nights as it is en-route from Passau to Luxembourg and we found an apartment a few km out of town that has both air-conditioning and a washing machine (we have a lot of dirty washing after the last couple of weeks). The journey itself was not too bad. We had one stop for lunch and a a couple of delays for roadworks, etc near the end but still made it to the apartment by 5:45.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were met by the owner who let us in and showed us round another very nice and large apartment. We unloaded everything from the car and managed to get the cricket onto the tv. We watched that while unpacking, put on our first load of washing and then drove to the local ReWe to buy pizzas for tea. We ate them in the apartment with a few drinks and had a relatively early, sober night.
