              We woke up to the news that for the second year running Dave was missing the Munich trip at the last minute for family reasons. Roz, Cathy and I left Kingsclere at about 9:45 and drove to Heathrow Terminal 5. We left the car and got through the airport fairly quickly. We had not been sure if we would have to drop the car at Terminal 2 so had allowed plenty of time meaning that we had about two hours to kill before our 12:40 BA flight to Munich. The flight was a bit late leaving but made up the time and we arrived in Munich just before 16:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Again, we got through the airport quickly and were on an S-Bahn just after 4. We had to change to the U-Bahn at Ostbahnhof due to engineering works but were at the hotel by 17:10. We met Hoggy at reception. He had managed to lose his passport in the couple of hours him and Ed had been here before us. We checked in, and after helping him sort out his application for an emergency travel document, we headed to the Lowewnbrau Kellar.

              We were joined in there by Julie and Anne. We ordered food and had a very enjoyable couple of hours in there while getting through a few litres of beer each. We went from there to the Augustiner Stammhaus. Roz and I walked via the hotel and everyone else got the tram. We only had one in the Stammhaus as it was closing early. We headed from there to the Augustiner Kellar. I took Anne and Julie back to the hotel on the tram and then walked to the beer garden to join everyone else. We were joined by Regan at about 10 and had a couple in there before it closed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After walking back to the hotel, we had a final drink in the bar before going to bed.

              We were all due to meet at  The Chinese Tower beer garden at 12:30. Roz and I collected Cathy and walked there via Marienplatz and were there just after midday. Regan, Anne and Julie managed to be late despite going by bus. Hoggy and Ed managed to get lost and did not turn up until after 1:30. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We stayed in there for a couple and then had a slight change of plan. The weather had been very good up until then but was due to change during the afternoon. Roz, Cathy and I walked to The Hofbräuhaus and were joined by the others who got there by bus. We had a couple in there and were then due to go to the Augustiner Bräustuben where Regan had booked a table for 5:30. By the time we came out of the Hofbräuhaus, it was raining heavily. Roz, Ed and myself just went back inside for another beer while the others headed off to the tram stop. It had eased slightly by the time we had finished our drinks so we got the tram and rejoined everyone else.

              We had meals and a couple more drinks in the Bräustuben and went back into town and over to the Schneider Bräuhaus for one. Things are getting a bit vague by now but we all made it back to the Hofbräuhaus for a final beer before heading back to the hotel. Roz and I walked back and were home by 11:45.
