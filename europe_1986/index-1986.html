            Dad drove Jane and I to Brighton where Jane took out money for me. I then went for a couple of pints with Regan before returning to his house for half an hour. By the time I left his house I was having problems standing up.

        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Quite solid again apart from Hastings (three mile walk uphill). On arrival in Dover, I bought my ticket for the 01:00 crossing to Ostende and then went to find a pub. I had five pints in The Albion and then went to wait for the boat. Had four pints of Stella on the boat including one bought for me by a bus driver I was talking to.

        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Got off to a bad start by getting off the Ostende -> Brussels road. I finally got back on the road after five hours of going round in circles and traveling about 50 miles out of my way. The lift from Kortrijk to Deerlijk was one of the best ever. Just as I was about to get out of the car, the driver said "Would you like to drink a beer?" He drove me back to his father-in-law's bar where I had drinks bought by him and some of the locals. He then drove me back to the motorway. I arrived in Brussels about an hour and a half later. Spent most of the day wandering around doing nothing, trying to recover from the previous 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At 9:50, I got bored so instead of going to sleep, I decided to start hitching to Munich. I left the station and walked for about two hours until I found a main road to hitch on.

        <p class="diary-text">
            The first lift took me to the start of the motorway. The second was from a girl on her own who told me she would be able to take me all the way to Athens if I waited until Thursday. I could not decide what to do about this so she gave me her number and told me to call her if I wanted the lift (she then went home to her husband). I decided to carry on hitching as I could not find anywhere to sleep. After half an hour hitching I gave up and went to sleep in a bus shelter. I woke at about 7:30 and walked until I found somewhere to hitch from.

        <p class="diary-text">
            The first four lifts took five hours and left me about 30 miles up the  road. I then waited at a service station for an hour until a bloke stopped and took me 250 miles into Germany. The next lift took me 230 miles in under two hours, all the way to Munich. I left my stuff in a locker at the station and went to find a beer garden. The first one at Marienplatz was closed so I walked to the one at The English Garden where we went last year. This one was also closed so, hungry and thirsty, I went back into town and had a McDonalds. I then went back to the station, bought a can of beer and went to sleep in the waiting room.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 22nd July</span>
            Woken by police at 6:00. After about an hour of sorting out my stuff, I decided to go for a swim in the Olympic pool. I got to the pool by about 8 and stayed in for an hour. After this, I went back into town and had lunch consisting of bread and cheese in a beer garden. I also had a litre of beer. At about 1pm, I was ready to leave Munich so I walked out to the motorway. This was another hour and a half walk. My first lift was at 3:30 and straight away, I managed to lose the motorway.I then had four lifts which took me to within a couple of miles of Austria in about four hours and then a solid lift all the way to Italy.

            During this journey, I was bought a can of lager, a lemonade, one and a half apple strudels and a cup of coffee. We arrived in Italy at about 10pm and the bloke who was driving took me about 8 miles away from the motorway. He was a very nice old Dutch bloke but did not speak any English so there was a lot of confusion. I got a lift back to the motorway and decided to carry on hitching through the night.

        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            The morning was quite slow. Each lift would take about an hour to get and then would only go about 20 miles. Thinigs got better by Pescara N and at this point I thought I would have plenty of time to get tonight's ferry from Brindisi.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            From Pescara N, I got a lift to a motorway intersection which messed everything up. After about an hour, it was obvious I was not going to get a lift from there so I walked to the next junction. I walked most of the two miles in the grass behind the motorway barriers to avoid getting arrested but in places this was not possible so I had to walk on the motorway. I also had to run across a bridge for 300m as there was no hard shoulder.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            By the time I got to the next junction, it was about 3:30pm. I was knackered and hungry after going about 24 hours without sleep, food or drink. After standing for about half an hour I had to go and ask the motorway police at the toll booths where I could get water. They took pity on me and let me into their office where I drank about ten cups. I then went to sleep for an hour in the shade by the office.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had by now given up on the idea of trying to get today's ferry but with a couple of short quick lifts, then three taking me the last 150 miles in three hours, I got to Brindisi at 10:25, five minutes before sailing time. I went to buy my ticket only to be told that it was £33 one way to Corfu but would be £21 if I waited 24 hours. I decided to wait. I walked around for about an hour until everywhere had quietened down and then started to look for somewhere to sleep. The station had closed down for the night so I slept on a bench in a park opposite.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 24th July</span>
            I woke at 8 quite surprised that I had not been mugged or arrested during the night. At about 9, I changed £30 into lira and went to try and buy a ticket to Corfu for less than £21. I managed to get one for £17.50 all the way to Patras. This means that I will have to hitch home through Greece and Yugoslavia which I am not keen on.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I went for lunch at 11 - spaghetti, pizza napolitana and a pint and then spent the rest of the day sleeping or sitting by a fountain in the centre of Brindisi. At 7:30, I went to get on the boat stopping for two pizza slices on the way. On the boat, I met two English blokes who had hitched down from London. We started drinking and smoking and were soon joined by two Americans. After a while, everyone (except me) started arguing about politics. This got very boring and I was relieved when everyone went to bed. I went to sleep on the deck at about 12. One of the English blokes was a juggler who had left his balls in Munich!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 25th July</span>
            The boat arrived in Corfu at 11:30, 4½ hours late. I walked with the two English blokes to the bus station where they caught a bus to Pelakas and I caught one to Camping Vatos. Dave and Jeremy had not arrived by the time I got there. I found somewhere to leave my stuff, had lunch and then walked to Myrtiotissa Beach. I did not stay long as I did not have any sun oil with me. I walked back to the campsite and spent most of the afternoon doing nothing.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening, I was walking past the bar when I heard Marillion playing. I went in for a pint and ended up getting pissed with a S. African bloke. He told me there is plenty of work available on the island and when I asked George about this he said I could start work tomorrow at 9. Most of the work is labouring for about £7.50 a day + a free meal. I only vaguely remember leaving the bar and I don't remember going to bed at all.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 26th July</span>
            Woke at 8:50 (or so I thought) and went to find George. By the time I got to reception he had gone which did not bother me much as my head was hurting and I did not feel like working. I slept until lunchtime, had a cheese roll and then went down to the beach for about an hour. I then went back to the campsite and slept in the shade for the remainder of the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">In the evening, I could not be bothered to go to the bar so after showering and having tea, I lazed around until it got dark and then went to bed.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 27th July</span>
            I woke up quite early after sleeping for most of the previous 24 hours. Two girls just below me left the site during the morning so I moved my stuff down to practically the same position as last year. A group of Italians tried to get me to move so that they could put their tent where I was sleeping. I said they couldn't and pretended to go to sleep. They went somewhere else after a while.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Half the people on the campsite seem to be leaving due to some sort of illness that is going round. The doctor calls on someone different every night and this morning, someone threw up all over the place while I was trying to have breakfast. I have decided not to eat in the camp site restaurant and I'm thinking of stopping the cheese rolls as well.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I spent about two hours down the beach and my tan is just about starting to appear. After showering, I wrote postcards home and had tea. I have gone off cheese rolls and threw one of them away. The Italians have just got back from the beach. They do not seem capable of talking, thye have to shout to each other even though they arae only standing a foot apart. There was a mime artist performing in the bar at 10:30 tonight. I went at 9:30 and had a couple of pints. I could not be bothered to watch the mime artist so I went to bed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 28th July</span>
            Woke quite early again and waited for Dave and Jeremy who were supposed to arrive today (I think). They had not come by midday so I went to the beach. The weather was not so warm today so I came back after about an hour. When I got back I bought The News of the World and went to the bar where I had a pizza and two cokes.(On the way to the beach I met George and apologised for not turning up on Saturday. I told him that I would like to start work next week and he has given me the job of campsite night-watchman for a month. I will stay out here for another six weeks and then go home via the Munich beer festival.)
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After I had had a shower, Dave and Jeremy appeared. They have been staying at Ipsos for four or five days. We spent the evening in the bar where we had about nine pints. When the bar closed at 1:30 we went to Pam Pam's where we stayed for about half an hour.

            Woke at 9:30, had a couple of joints and then went to the bar for the start of  the all day session. We stayed in the bar until 6pm having nine pints and three pizzas each. At 6, Me and Jeremy decided to go to sleep for an hour. Inevitably we didn't wake up again!

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 30th July</span>
            Regained consciousness at about 9:30 and decided to go and visit the ouzo factory. We got the bus to Agios and were in the tasting room by about 10:30. We sampled four different types of liqueurs and then bought a bottle of banana flavoured one. We took this back to the campsite, drank it and then went to the bar.

            The bloke in reception had to lend us money to go to the bar as we had none. We drank beer in the bar until we ran out of money and then drank duty free vodka with coke. During the afternoon we played cards with me and Dave both winning money from Jeremy. We carried on drinking (11 pints) until the bar closed at 1:30. At some point Jeremy got annoyed about something and threw a bottle of beer on the floor. Solid entertainment! None of us remember leaving the bar or going to bed.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 31st July</span>
            Woken at 9:30 by Paul and Brian who are doing Inter Rail. Paul did not have my money with him which was a bit of a blow. I have now only got about £30 left.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At about lunch time we made it to the beach for the first time in three days. We walked to Myrtiotissa and stayed there for the rest of the day. We had lunch in a taverna by the beach (pastitsio and cokes).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got back to the campsite, we all had showers and then went for a session. We started in the campsite bar and then walked up to Spiros Taverna. We all had souvlaki and chips plus a lot of beer and ouzo. We left the taverna when it closed at about 1:30 and walked to Pam Pam's taking with us a bottle of ouzo which we had bought. At this point the memory started to disappear. Jeremy was left unconscious outside the disco while Paul and Brian carried me back. On the way back Paul was attacked by a barbed-wire fence and decided to leave me by the side of the road. I was then carried by two blokes who I have never met before and who I still don't know. I think they put me by reception as that was where I woke up the next day.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 1st August</span>
            I was woken at 9 by the manager and I then went to bed for three hours. Had lunch in the bar and then Paul, Brian and Dave went to the beach while me and Jermey tried to sleep off our hangovers. In the evening we went to the taverna down the road for a meal. The service and the food were terrible and the meal was ended when a rat ran across the string of lights above our table.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After this we went to The Acropolis Bar to play bar football, table tennis, etc until it closed at 1. We then went to Pam Pam's which was dead and from there to a beach party that everyone seemed to be going to. The party turned out to be at Panoramsas, a taverna near Myrtiotssa and it was full of weirdos who were all stoned out of their minds. We stayed about half an hour and then walked back and went to sleep.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 2nd August</span>
            Woke at 9:30. Spent most of the morning doing nothing or drinking cokes at the bar. At lunchtime, we caught the bus to Glyfada where we spent about five hours lying in the garden of the hotel. Everyone else hired a pedalo but I could not be bothered.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening, we went to Spiros for tea - the usual souvlaki and chips. We then went back to The Acropolis Bar and played the games while drinking ouzo. After this, we went to the campsite bar for last orders (on the way, Jeremy threw up). When the bar closed, we drank one of the bottles of wine we bought in Spiros and then went to Pam Pam's. Me and Paul got quite pissed there mainly due to heading the half drunk cocktails of two Swiss blokes who we thought had left. They were sitting opposite us as we drank them! We spent a couple of hours dancing and left at about 4:30. I vaguely remember going to bed. I have now acquired an inflatable sun bed that somebody left behind.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            So far I have consumed about 70 pints since leaving home and nearly a litre of spirits. I think I am going to have to stop drinking soon due to a severe shortage of money.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 3rd August</span>
            Woke at 10:30 and after breakfast in the bar, we said goodbye to Paul and Brian who are going to sleep in Corfu Town tonight before catching tomorrow's ferry. Me, Dave and Jeremy spent the afternoon lying in the shade due to slight hangovers. We used my tents flysheet to construct a sun shade which worked reasonably well.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening, we went to the bar and drank the remainder of the vodka and then went and sat in our sun shade where we drank three litres of wine by candlelight. At about 1 we went to Pam Pam's (via the bar for three ouzos). I left at 3:30 thinking that the others had already gone. They left about two hours later.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 4th August</span>
            Woke at 10:30 again and after going to the bar for cokes, we had breakfast consisting of buttered rolls and crisps. At about midday we went to the beach in the campsite van with about 20 other people. We stayed on the beach for about an hour and a half before going to the taverna for spag bol. We went back to the beach for the rest of the afternoon and then hitched back to the campsite.

            In the evening, I discovered that I had lost the job of night-watchman. I am pretty sure that George found someone who would start earlier even though he told me I could start today. After that bit of news I went to the bar where I managed to lose £4.50 at cards while drinking ouzo. At about 10 we went back to the sleeping bags and drank 3 litres of wine around a camp fire. The fire started off as a candle but sort of spread. When we went back to the bar at 12, people were complaining about the smell of burning rubber which I think was due to us setting light to a tennis ball.

            When the bar closed we went to Pam Pam's where Jeremy became unconscious. At 3, Dave and I tried without success to wake him so left him there and went back to the campsite. He staggered back about half an hour later after being throw out of the disco.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 5th August</span>
            Woke at 10:30 and went to the bar. On the way Jeremy, who had woken up covered in a rash, collapsed and then threw up all over the place. We decided not to go to the beach due to Jeremy's illness. We spent the day lying in the sun and drinking water.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At about 7 we went to the bar for ouzos and to play cards. We stayed until 10 and then went back for our usual three litres of wine by candle light. We went back to the bar and had 7 ouzos - 4 more than usual. I don't remember anything after this.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I spent most of the day trying to work out what to do for the rest of my holiday. I have gone off the idea of working ut if I am to stay here I will have to get  a job. I don't want to have to go home as it seems to be raining every day. I think I will probably leave on Saturday at teh same time as Dave and Jeremy but go to Athens and try and get a job there. I would like to stay here without having to work but can not afford to.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 6th August</span>
            Spent the day sunbathing at the campsite as we could not be bothered to go to the beach. In the evening we had a litre of wine each and a couple of ouzos and then went to Pam Pam's. None of us really wanted to go but we all went so as not to jib.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 7th August</span>
            Woke up quite early and spent most of the day doing nothing. Again, we could not be bothered to go to the beach. In the evening we started talking to the three English girls who were camping near us. Later on we invited them to our going away party. They were quite solid apart from the fact that they would not drink anything and went to bed early. After drinking nearly a litre and a half of wine each we went to the bar for a round of ouzos. Me and Dave went to bed when the bar closed. Jeremy was unconscious and stayed until 3:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            While we were drinking, Jeremy threw up and also confessed to a previous puke. 4 - 0 - 0. We got told off by the night-watchman for being sober last night.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 8th August</span>
            Woke at about 10 and packed our rucksacks before going to the bar. Me and Jeremy decided to have an all day session on ouzo. Dave was feeling ill so did not join in.

            At 6, Ann, Fiona and Jill (the English girls) came to collect us to go into Corfu Town for tomorrow mornings boat. Jeremy was unconscious and had to be carried to the bus stop and then placed on the bus.

            In Corfu Town, Jeremy was unconscious again. Me and Dave looked after all the rucksacks while the girls disappeared for an hour. Jeremy eventually recovered enough to walk to the port unaided and we got there at about 10. Jeremy then had to get a taxi back to the campsite to get his coat from a washing line. We all went to sleep in the car park at the port.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 9th August</span>
            Woke at 6 and went with the girls to pay port tax. I was told that my boat does not run today which means I have another 24 hour wait. The girls left at 7 and I arranged to meet them at Joys if they are still in Athens when I get there. Dave and Jeremy left at 9. I walked back towards the town centre and went to the park opposite the bus station (where I slept for most of the day). During the day an old Greek bloke came and started talking to me. He bought me a can of coke and a packet of biscuits. At the moment I am bored and fed up with everything. I am starting to wish I was back home but I have no way of getting there. Jeremy lent me £50 of which I have £7 left. I am going to have to get a job either in Athens or Munich just to get home. I have also got a hangover.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I went to the port at 5:30 and started talking to a group of English blokes mainly because they had todays Sun. At 10, the police started clearing everyone outside. I went out anyway as it was too hot inside. While I was outside, the old Greek bloke came and bought me coke and biscuits again. I could not work out if he wanted something or if he was just being friendly. I think he was just pleased to have someone to talk to.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At 11, the English blokes were kicked out and they joined me in the car park. During the night a group of Italians tried to molest two Danish girls who were sleeping together behind me. They woke up half the car park in the process and after about half an hour had to leave due to the number of complaints. I finally got to sleep at about 3.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 10th August</span>
            Woke at 6:30 and went to pay my port tax 200 Dr. The boat arrived on time and after saying goodbye to the English blokes, I boarded at 7. I took my rucksack to the top deck and found quite a good spot with my own bench. After a while I was joined by a group of English girls who sat next to me and inevitably a larger group of accompanying Italians. I soon got bored with them but stayed there anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had decided not to buy anything whilst on the boat and so survived the journey on my biscuits from yesterday. At one point I cracked due a chronic thirst and went to the bar to discover that they had just sold out of water. At this point I decided that I would have to get out of the sun and went to sit inside. I found a solid bench to sleep on in the air-conditioned lounge only to be woken five minutes later by more bloody Italians who were trying to break into the duty free shop. I went to sit back in the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Spent the rest of the day alternating between in and outside before arriving in Patras at about 6. On arrival, I bought a bottle of water and went in search of the motorway. On the way, I bumped into John, Dave's mate who we were supposed to be meeting in Majorca. He bought me a spag bol (much needed) before pointing me towards the motorway. As soon as I arrived, I realised it was not going to be easy hitching there and after an hour I walked the mile and a half back to the port and caught the 9:30 bus to Athens. This cost me 900 Dr + 50 for my rucksack and left me with 230 Dr. I spent half the journey talking to an obnoxious Canadian who is touring the world and the rest of the time sleeping.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I arrived in the centre of Athens at 1 and after a bit of confusion managed to locate Joys. Ann, Jill and Fiona were not there when I arrived so I had a shower and am now in the bar drinking water I got from a tap in Patras. I am relieved to have arrived in Athens but a bit worried about the money situation. I am going to have to change 10p into drachma just to pay for my night on the roof.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 11th August</span>
            Woken up and kicked off the roof at 7 (I had managed to get about four hours sleep as the roof was crowded and hot). I left my stuff at Joys and went to look for a job. I spent three hours going round the hostels and hotels without success. By 11 I decided to hitch to Munich without any money. I paid my bill at Joys and managed to get away with paying 230 Dr instead of 250.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had briefly looked at someone's map of Athens and spotted a road to Thessalonika so I set off in that direction. I was joined by a Colombian hitcher and we wlked about four miles before coming to a dual carriageway. I decided to stay there and he went on as it is easier hitching on your own. After an hour, I got bored and decided to return to Athens. On the way I went to the British Embassy as the Canadian I met last night had said that his embassy would fly home any Canadian in my position. They effectively told me to piss off. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After this, I walked back to Athens station. I managed to enter the town from the opposite side to which I left it. On my way I found a street map which showed that the start of the motorway to Thessalonika is only about a mile from the station (I think). I am now in the station preparing to start hitching again after five hours of tiring time wasting.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Here I am again back at the station! I walked the two miles to the motorway, waited an hour and walked back again. I have decided that the embassy will have to phone Dad and ask him to send me money. I will ask for £80 even though I probably wont need that amount. I went to the bus station today and discovered that a bus to Munich would cost £52.. I would be quite happy to hitch from there but with the boat fare as well, this would be a total of £67. I think that from here, I could fly to London for less than that. Whatever happens, it will be the cheapest option that does not involve hitching to Munich. I would like to phone Dad and tell him about the situation first but I do not have any money at all.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Today I have walked about 15 miles (at least 12 with rucksack). I have only eaten two biscuits. The presents from the old man in Corfu have saved my life in the last couple of days. The three days since the session on Friday have been the longest of my life. Never mind, things can only get better.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Like I said, "things can only get better". Shortly after writing that, I was walking round the station trying to change pound coins into drachma when I met Brian and Paul. They were waiting for their train to Venice. I stayed with them for a couple of hours until their train arrived. I have arranged to meet Paul in Munich at 6 in a weeks time. I think this is a bit optimistic.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            As I was going to wave goodbye to them, I met two girls that I had briefly spoken to at Joys this morning. One is from Australia and the other from N.Z. They bought me a coke in the station and we talked for an hour. They then went back to their hostel while I went to the end of the station platform to try and sleep for the night. That is where I am now. The bloke who is sleeping by me has a watch that beeps every hour.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 12th August</span>
            Woke at 7:15 and went straight to the British Embassy. This walk is about two miles. They phoned Dad and he said he would send the money. He phoned me back to say he would sort it out and let me know later what was happening. I walked back into Athens and went to the station. The woman at the Embassy gave me money for breakfast. I ate my biscuits and bought The Sun instead.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            On the way back from the Embassy, I looked at prices of buses/trains/planes. The cheapest way of getting back is by bus for about £55 to London but I don't really fancy that. At about 11:30 I had to go back to the Embassy to wait for Dad's phone call. I left my rucksack at the station as I was getting fed up of carrying it. I was almost hoping someone would steal it.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Dad phoned me at 1:00 and I was surprised that the money was already at the Embassy (£135). I walked back to the station feeling a lot happier than I had done 24 hours ago. I decided that I would get a Transalpino ticket to Munich and asked at information where the office was. It was a mile and a half away but I had walked within 100m of it on my way back from the Embassy.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            At about 3, I left the station again leaving my rucksack in the same place as before. I bought the ticket to Munich for £45 and walked back again. I am getting fed up with walking - my feet are covered in blisters.

            In the evening, Liz and Karen, the girls I met at the station last night came over again and we went out for a meal - a donar kebab and an ice-cream. We then walked up to the Acropolis pausing for a can of Carlsberg on the way. We watched the light show which was quite good but I think we were at the wrong angle to appreciate it fully. We then walked back, the girls to their hostel and me to the station. My rucksack was still on the platform where I left it. No-one will steal it. The train to Bucharest is here again.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 13th August</span>
            Woke up at 8 next to a tramp that had obviously arrived during the night. I left the station at 8:30 and went to sit in a park for a couple of hours. I then spent 2 - 3 hours wandering round Athens. I had lunch in a cafe near The Plaka - kebab + pint of Carlsberg (the waiter tried to do me out of my change - £4.25). I then went back to the station where I met Liz and Karen. They went at 2:45 to meet the Belgrade train as they are runners for one of the hostels. I queued for about an hour and reserved a seat on tomorrow night's train to Munich.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            When the girls came back I went with them to the hostel that they run for (Larrisiakon). I booked in and went up to reserve a place on the roof. The hostel was a lot worse than Joys but at least it was not as crowded.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After having a shower we went with another girl from N.Z. to a cafe over the road for a beer. We went back to the hotel for about half an hour and then went out for tea - souvlaki and chips + ice-cream. We returned to the hotel and crashed out on the roof at about 10:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 14th August</span>
            Woke at 8:30. Liz and Karen left straight away to go and meet a train. I stayed half an hour before taking my rucksack to the station and then going for breakfast - pizza and ice-cream. I met the girls again at lunchtime and we spent most of the afternoon sitting around in the shade. They went off for a train again at 5 so I went and bought food for the train journey tonight. They came to say goodbye at 7 and the train pulled out 20 minutes late at 7:20.

            I could not get to the compartment where my seat was so I wen tin another at the other end of the carriage. I was sharing with four Austrian blokes, two Greeks and an old Greek woman. She was quite solid handing round sweets, etc. During the night my rucksack fell on her - no more sweets! The evening went quite quickly and I eventually fell asleep at about 11. One of the Austrians was passing a Metaxa bottle around. Solid bloke!

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 15th August</span>
            At about 5, the Greek woman left and was replaced by two German blokes. This made nine in the compartment. I was the one that should not have been there but I kept my mouth shut. During the day we were taking it in turns to stand or lie in the corridor so it did not get too crowded. The day was good for traveling - cloudy and not too hot. Most of the time I was bored but the day still seemed to go quite quickly. By the time we got to Belgrade, we were only 1 hour 40 minutes late. Went to sleep at about 10.

            Woke up quite a lot during the night because the compartment was crowded and hot. There was not enough room to lie down in the corridor. The Austrian blokes got out at Salzburg at 10 and the train arrived in Munich at midday, 1 hour 50 minutes late (a 42 hour journey).

        <p class="diary-text">
            When I arrived, I went to change my Greek money into Marks. I think I should have done this before leaving Greece as over here, my £70 is worth only £51. I could not make up my mind whether to wait here for Paul or to go home. I decided to wait but had it been a week day I would definitely have gone. I changed a third of my money and decided to try and sell the rest to Inter Railers going to Greece. If this fails, I should still have enough money as long as I don't go too mad in the next few days. At the moment I am in the beer garden near the Marienplatz. This does not help the financial situation but it makes it seem better.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I will now definitely wait for Paul on Monday. If he arrives, I will leave on Tuesday morning, if not, I will go on Monday night.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had three steins in the beer garden and then walked back to the station. I met two English blokes who said they would consider buying my money so I arranged to meet them later. I met them at 7 and I sold them £45 of drachma for £40. This ended up costing me quite a bit as I went out on a session with them! We went back to the Marienplatz beer garden and I had another two steins. We then went to a pizza place where I had a pizza and a pint. I only vaguely remember the meal and have not got a clue where the restaurant is. We walked from there to the station where we crashed out at about 1 (after a couple of bottles).

            Woken by police at 5:30. It was still dark when we woke so we walked to a park just round the corner from the station. We had to climb over a fence to get in as it was locked up for the night. I woke again at 7 to find that a building just inside the gate was on fire. The police came over and asked us questions for about ten minutes and then let us go after taking our names and addresses. The English blokes decided to leave Munich as soon as possible and they caught the 8:15 train to Athens.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I went to McDonalds for breakfast and then wandered around for an hour. It started raining at 11 so I went back to the station. From there I phoned Gareth with the 5p pieces I had.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            I had a salad from McDonalds for lunch. On the way back I was watching a juggler performing when another busker came over and started arguing. There was a solid fight and the second bloke had to be taken away in an ambulance. I spent the afternoon sleeping in a park. I had cheese and biscuits for tea and then in the evening I walked up and down between Karlsplatz and Mariensplatz watching the buskers and performers. I went back to the station at 9 and went to sleep at about 12.

            Woken by police at 4:50 and again at 5:45. It was raining when I got up so I had to sit in the station for an hour and a half. At about 7:30 I decided to go swimming at the Olympic pool. I caught the tube there only to discover that it does not open until 10 on a Monday. I could not be bothered to wait so got the tube back to the station. At 9, I went out to buy presents and then went to sleep in the park for a couple of hours.

        <p class="diary-text">
            I walked around the shops until 2 and then went to the station as I thought Paul arrived at 2:19. He arrived early and I met him at 2:10. We walked down to Marienplatz and went for a stein at the beer garden. At 4 we decided to walk to the Deutshe Museum. This was quite solid with lots of buttons to press, etc but unfortunately it closed at 5 so we did not have a chance to see it properly.

            On the way back we found a solid shop that just seemed to sell beer. We bought five different beers each for abotu £1.50.We walked back to the park by the station and drank a bottle each while sitting with our feet in the pond.

At 10 we went out to the Mathäser which was quite solid but we went into the wrong part and got kicked out when we went into the bigger rooms. We went back to the station at 11 and drank the rest of our bottles. We were joined by two marines from Newcastle who were drunk and obnoxious. At 1:30 I decided I would start hitching straight away instead of waiting until the morning. I packed all my stuff up and then discovered that the station was shut for the night and I could not get out. I went back and slept instead!

            Woken by police at 5 and I left the station at 5:15. I arranged to meet Paul again on tonights 2am ferry. The motorway was an hour and a quarters walk away. The first lift took two and a quarter hours to get but took me quite a long way. It also took me in a direction I didn't really want to go in as it meant I would have to hitch round Cologne which is confusing. At Solingen I met Thomas, a German who spoke perfect English. I met him again two stops later and we carried on together from there.

            At 10:30 we were about 40 miles from Ostende with plenty of time left. We then got dropped in the middle of nowhere on a junction with no traffic. We walked along the motorway for two miles to a service station which was dead. At 12:50 we gave up and went to sit inside. I went to sleep in a telephone kiosk at 1:30.

            I probably would have made it in time for the 2am boat had it not been for the first lift taking me miles out of the way. By the time I went to sleep I was cold, wet and hungry after another 24 hours without food.

            Woke up at 6:30, still cold wet and hungry. We started hitching at 7. We had to hitch all the way to Ostende standing on the motorway as we kept getting dropped at intersections. Arrived in Ostende at 10, lucky not to have been arrested on the way.

            We spent half an hour trying to get lifts across the channel without success. There did not seem to be many lorries going and those that were did not want to know. At 11 we gave up and went to buy boat tickets. These cost us 50DMs + £3 i.e. about £19. I do not know why it costs so much more to go back than it did to go out. We got on the boat at 11:15 and it left at 11:45. I had two bread rolls with mayonnaise for lunch, my first meal since Munich. I now have £1.40 left and I am saving that for the tube in London.

            Arrived in Dover at 3:15 and started hitching straight away. After 2 mins I saw a lorry with "Ireland" written all over the side. The lorry was driving past me so I shouted to the driver asking if he was going to Ireland. He stopped about 20m down the road and gave me a lift all the way to Carmarthen. This was probably the best lift i have had in my life. From Carmarthen I had a lift to within two miles of Llansteffan and I walked back from there.
