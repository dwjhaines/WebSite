                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 17th June</span>
                We checked out of the Luton Premier Inn by about 6:30 and drove the few miles to the airport. Getting through the airport was not too bad and our Wizz Air flight to Wroclaw left just about on time at 8:30. We appeared to be the only non-Polish people on the flight which landed on time at 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Getting through the airport did not take long and, after getting cash out, we got a taxi to the Mercure Hotel on the outskirts of the old town. It was cold and wet when we arrived but after leaving our stuff in the room, we headed out for a look around the old town..... and to start looking for dwarfs!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The main square is only about a five minute walk from where we are staying. We walked up to the square and went in search of somewhere for lunch. The place Roz wanted to eat at had closed down but we found another place doing plates of Polish Ravioli and soup which was all quite tasty and very cheap. We walked form there back to the square which was very spectacular. We spent about half an hour walking round taking photos and also collected our dwarf map.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the room for a couple of hours sleep. By the time we woke up, it was obvious that our air-con was not working and the room was very hot. After about an hour of discussions with various hotel staff, they agreed to move us to another room. We could not move rooms until 8:00 for some reason so we headed back to the square for a couple of drinks while we waited. We had a couple of beers in Beer Halle, a Bavarian style place, before going back to the hotel and moving to a "privilege room" on the sixth floor. The room was not quite as big but had excellent views and an air-con unit that was slightly better than the previous one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to the square to continue drinking. We had one in the exellently named Zloty Pies Brewery and then went to Spitz, the third big brewery in the square. Something was going on here as we could not get a drink despite it being only about 20% full so we went instead to a more normal type of bar just off the main square. We discovered that one of the big Polish brewers produces a wheat beer which was very good news so remained in there for the rest of the evening
            </p>
           
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 18th June</span>
                We were up by about 10 without too much of a hangover.... in fact I had finally got rid of the virus that I have had for the last week and was feeling better than I have done for a while. We had breakfast from the McDonalds in the shopping centre next to the hotel and then headed out for a few hours of sight-seeing</p>
                <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Initially, we repeated what we had done yesterday i.e. walking round the main square. It was much warmer today and everything looked better in the sun with blue sky in the background. The town hall was particularly spectacular. We spent a lot of time looking for dwarfs and ticking them off on the map as we went. We spent a good hour or so in the main square area before walking out to Cathedral Island. We were back at the shopping centre by the hotel by about 2:30 and had our fist Polish buffet for lunch. We were both worn out after this so it was back to the hotel for a couple of hours sleep again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the old town again ini the evening. We went in by a different route to usual to tick off a few more dwarfs and stopped for  a couple of drinks on our way. Zloty Pies was not serving food so we ate at Beerhalle. We had excellent meals and a few more wheat beers sat outside in the main square before returning to last nights bar for a few more. Had a relatively early and more sober end to the evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 19th June Slovakia v England</span> We checked out of the hotel at 8:00 and walked abour a mile to the train staton, ticking off one more dwarf on the way. We had breakfast at the station (zapiekanki - a Polish pizza bread type thing) while we waited for the 8:55 train to Kielce, the venue for both the England games we are going to. The train was on time and was a reminder of the days of Interrail - we were in an 8-seater compartment and the train was totally full. Despite the number of people, it was reasonably comfortable and the journey went quite quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Kielce on time at 1:15. We walked across the road to the Best Western Hotel where we met Steve in reception. We arranged to meet up at 3ish and then Roz and I walked to the Ibis where we are booked in for tonight. We checked into our room which thankfully had working air-conditioning and then headed out for the day getting given a shot of Vodka from Slovakian fans as we left reception.
            </p>           
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-003.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">There is not too much to see and do in Kielce but it is a nice enough place with an old square in the centre with a few bars. The square was packed with football fans but we were in the unusual position of being out-numbered by about 100 to 1. Slovakia is not a long way from Kielce so their fans had travelled in quite large numbers and there are not too many England fans around. We eventually got a table outside the Stary Brower and spent the rest of the afternoon sat there. Once again, the beer was good, the food was good and the atmosphere was a bit more relaxed than at full England games. It was good being able to enjoy the atmosphere without having to listen to 10 German Bombers and No Surrender being constantly sung!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The three of us walked out to the ground at about 5:15 for the 6:00 kick-off. It took about 15 minutes and surprisingly, we managed to sell Mark's ticket just before going in. There was a bit of confusion about where we were sat but once in our seats, we had excellent views. We were in the front row of the upper tier, in the centre by the press boxs, right above the Slovakian dug-out. Steve was in the block next to us and joined us at half time.
            </p>
             <p class="diary-text">The game went pretty well with England eventually winning 2 - 1 and Alfie Mawson getting the first goal. We watched the players leave the pitch and then walked back into town. Roz had to go back to the ground to retrieve the Lonely Planet but by 9:00 we were all back in the Stary Brower. We watched the Poland v Sweden game there while eating and then went to the Craft Beer Pub for a few more. Went back to the hotel when the bar closed at about 1am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 20th June</span> We checked out of the hotel at 9 and walked back to the main square to buy breakfast. We had not been that impressed with the food at the station yesterday so we bought ham, cheese and bread from a supermarket and ate it sat on a bench in the square. We walked down the long pedestrianised street to the station where we bought tickets for the 10:55 train to Krakow, as well as tickets to get back here on Thursday for the game against Poland. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-004.JPG"></div>
             <p class="diary-text">We were joined by Steve at the station. The train was more modern than yesterdays and was air-conditioned, half empty and very comfortable. It was about 20 minutes late getting into Krakow but it still felt a bit of a shame having to get off! We walked from the station to the main square and to the office of the apartment company we had booked through. Someone from the office then walked with us to the apartment about 10 minutes away. The apartment was very nice with two bedrooms and everything we could need for a couple of days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out almost straight away for some sight-seeing. We started with the impressive main square again before heading down to the castle area. Saw plenty of churches along the way and some very spectacular buildings. We had something to eat after exiting the castle via the "Dragons Den" and were back at the apartment by about 5:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back out at 7ish and headed to the Jewish Quarter. This was not actually that spectacular but it is an area packed with restaurants and was a bit quieter than the central area of Krakow. We had another very good meal and walked back to the centre. I was totally knackered by the time we got back and would happily have gone back to the apartment and gone to bed but Steve was keen on Portugal v Spain and it was being shown in The Bull. This was not too bad as the game was OK, the pub was air-conditioned and they sold Paulaner. We walked straight back to the apartment after the game and were in bed before 12:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 21st June</span> We went out to a near-by supermarket for another round of ham,, cheese and bread and ate breakfast in the apartment. We had booked onto the 11:30 tour of the Salt Mines so left the apartment at 10ish and walked to the station for the 10:41 train. The train took just over 20 minutes and got us there in plenty of time for the start of the tour.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-005.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The tour was very good. We went down 135m underground and spent about 2 hours walking through the chambers looking at statues and other rock carvings. All very spectacular and enjoyable (although none of us could be bothered with the tour of the salt museum at the end of the visit). There was a lot of faffing about to get out of the mine but we were back on the surface in time to get the 14:13 train back to Krakow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once back in Krakow, we walked back to the main square where we had lunch and our first beer of the day. We walked from there to a brewery which is just round the corner from where we are staying, and spent the rest of the afternoon there. We managed to get a table outside and once again, they produced a very good wheat beer. We did not have too many other options for drinking in the area so there seemed no reason to move. A very enjoyable afternoon!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the brewery at about 7:45 and started to make our way to the ground. We stopped at the apartment to collect Lee and then had about a 10 minute walk to the ground. One of the many advantages of this tournament is that the games are at small grounds that are near the centres of the towns. No messing about with public transport. There was more confusion about getting to our seats again with Roz and Steve failing to find a way to get to the top tier, but once I had joined them, we had an excellent view again. The game was reasonably good and although we do not usually bother with non-England games, it was definately worth going to.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the game, we went back to the C. K. Brewery for a couple more and then had a kebab in the old town before going back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 22st June England v Poland</span> Breakfast in the apartment again and then another walk to the station for the 11:14 train back to Kielce. Arrived in Kielce at 12:46 and walked back up to the same Ibis we had left on Tuesday. We headed back to the main square just after 2:00. We had a few beers with lunch at the Stary Brower before leaving the square and spending the rest of the afternoon at the Craft Beer Pub just round the corner. It was a very enjoyable afternoon. There were not as many fans around as there had been on  Monday and still hardley any England fans, but there was still enough people around to ceate a good atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left for the ground at about 7:45, got in without any problems and all managed to find our way to our correct seats. We were totally outnumbered by Polish fans but there were a few other England fans in our end. There were a lot of families in our section so despite the number of Poles, it was not too hostile a place to watch the game from. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was very good with England winning 3 - 0, winning the group in the process and gettting into the semi-final. We returned to the Craft Beer Pub after the game. Steve stayed for one drink but left as he has an early train tomorrow. Roz and I stayed there until it closed at about 2 am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It had been an excellent day but the end of the tournament for us as we fly home on Sunday. It has been a really good experiance and in a lot of ways, it has been better than watching the senior tournaments. It had all the good bits of a proper tournament i.e. eight days of nothing but eating, drinking and watching football but not so many of the crap bits i.e. cheap tickets, grounds within 10 minutes walk from town centres, cheap hotels, able to sit in main squares without having to listen to 10 German Bombers, no fan zones, no 15 hour journeys between games, no hassle getting in and out of grounds and only three days between each of the games. Will definatly go the next one in Italy in 2019 if we qualify!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-007.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 23rd June</span> After a late breakfast in the room, we checked out of the hotel at midday and walked to the station for the 12:50 train to Warsaw. We had booked first class tickets for this journey so once again, it was a vey comfortable journey. The train was on time and we got into Warsaw just before 16:00.We had a 15 minute walk to our hotel and got quite wet as it was raining heavily for the first 5 minutes of the walk. We had booked the Sofitel for the last two nights of the trip - a bit of a step up from our usual hotels but still relatiely cheap at £59 a night
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out for the evening at about 6. We were staying in the area between the old and new towns and had a list of three craft beer pubs that we wanted to go to, all in the new town. Craft beer pubs seem to be quite big in Poland and we found a fourth, PiwPaw not long after leaving the hotel. We had one in there, one in Hoppiness and then walked a bit further away to where there were two opposite each other. We went to Jabeerwocky first and then Kufle i Kapsle before returning to Jabeerwocky, probably the best of the four. We stopped at PiwPaw for a couple more before returning to the hotel sometime after 1am.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/poland/poland-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 24th June</span> We did not have too much to do today as Warsaw does not have a large number of tourist attractions. We did not get up until about 11:30 due to the effects of last night's beer. We started walking towards the old town and stopped for breakfast at a restaurant on the way. We continued walking to the main tourist area of the old town and saw the royal castle, main square and several quite impressive churches. From there, we walked back into the new town for a look at the Palace of Culture. It was all quite nice without being too spectacular and probably better than I thought it was going to be. Warsaw does not have a great reputation for being a tourist town but I have been quite impressed with both the bars and what sights it does have.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in the room by 2:30 ish and had a couple of hours sleep before going out for the evening again. It was a similar evening to yesterday visiting the same pubs in the same order. We had a pizza with our beer in PiwPaw and then visited the other three again spending quite a bit of time in Jabeerwocky and Kufle i Kapsle. Neither of us remember being back in PiwPaw or getting back to the hotel sometime after 1am for the second night running.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 25th June</span> Checked out of the hotel at about 10:30 and got a taxi to the airport. McDonalds for breakfast before getting on the 12:20 WiizzAir flight back to Luton.
