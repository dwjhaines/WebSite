        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 15 - Friday, 25th June </span>
        We had another early start as we had booked a 
		sunrise drive at Addo. We were at the visitor centre by 6:45 and started 
		the drive at 7. We were in a large vehicle with about 20 other people 
		but it was open sided so again was a lot better than the minibus. The 
		drive was excellent again - lots of elephants and a large herd of of 
		buffalo at a water hole being the highlights. We were back at the guest 
		house by 9:30 for showers and a large breakfast before starting our 
		journey towards Bloemfontein.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We had booked a nights accommodation at Aliwal North which was about 
		half way. After a bit of indecision we stopped off at Mountain Zebra 
		National Park and did another two hour drive, this time in our own car. 
		Not as much to see here but there were plenty of zebras and the scenery 
		was again very spectacular so it was a worthwhile excursion. We left 
		there at 4ish and continued to Aliwal North where we arrived just after 
		7. We dropped our bags at the guest house and went straight out to eat 
		at a bar/restaurant. We had two huge pizzas between the three of us (one 
		would of been enough!), watched the Spain v Chile game and went back for 
		an early night.</p>

		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_0369.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 16 - Saturday, 26th June </span>
        We had plenty of time to get to Bloemfontein so had 
		a slight detour to visit Lesotho on the way. This was not such a 
		worthwhile excursion as the most notable thing about the country seemed 
		to be the way that there road-works were organised. We had a trip to the 
		ruins of a mountain fortress, but none of us could be bothered to 
		actually walk up to it when we found it, and headed back into South 
		Africa without stopping anywhere else. If it was not for the fact that 
		we got additional stamps in our passports, it would of been a complete 
		waste of time.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We got to Bloemfontein by six and were joined by the others about 30 
		minutes later. Due to the number of England fans here (and the Germans being able to book 
		rooms before us) we had not been able to get a room for two nights here. 
		We had a B + B for tonight in the centre of town and somewhere else 
		about 6 miles away for tomorrow. This was a bit of a shame as tonight's 
		place was about 15 minutes walk from the ground and would of been ideal 
		for tomorrow! It was also convenient for bars and restaurants - all 
		within walking distance. We spent most of the evening in Barba's 
		watching USA get knocked out and then stopped for a couple in Die Kellar 
		before walking home.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_9066.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 17 - Sunday, 27th June</span>
        It was Mark's birthday so after breakfast, he was 
		presented with the cuddly baboon that we bought back from Cape Town. We checked out of the B + B at about 9:30 and Mark, 
		Roz &amp; I drove the two cars out to tonight's accommodation. We checked 
		into three rooms, left all the bags and waited around for a taxi to take 
		us back into town. We got the taxi to the Waterfront area and met up 
		with the others who had got a table outside one of the cafes. The whole 
		area was packed with football fans and the bars were not able to cope. 
		It was difficult to get a beer from anywhere and was not an ideal place 
		to be so after one drink, we walked back to Barba's. The atmosphere here 
		was much better and they were able to cope with the amount of beer that 
		English fans wanted to drink. We stayed there for an hour or so before 
		walking to the ground. We got in without any problems and had another 
		beer before heading to our seats. Up until this point, the day had been 
		really good. We had been very lucky with the weather again and the whole 
		build up to the game had been very enjoyable.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_0387.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">Once again, the game was the worst part of an otherwise very good day. We 
		looked certain to lose after letting in the second goal but were very 
		unlucky not to level the score. We were at the wrong end to see if the 
		ball had crossed the line but as soon as the goal was not given, 
		everyone around us started receiving texts from home confirming that the 
		ball had crossed the line. Texts from Jens (or Nils) in Germany&nbsp; 
		apologising as well as one from Cathy, made it 100% certain that the 
		goal should of been given. Whether or not it would of made any 
		difference we will never know but it probably denied us the only chance 
		we were going to get of getting back into the game.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The exit was not as painful as in previous tournaments. The Algeria game 
		had been the low point of this World Cup. I think we all realised then 
		that we were not going to achieve anything out here. The fact that we 
		would all of preferred to come second in our group was an indication 
		that none of us thought that we were going to go much further and we 
		were all happy to get the chance of seeing one decent game against the 
		Germans before we went out. Seeing us get beaten in Rustenburg by Ghana 
		would have been a lot worse.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		Barba's was charging to get in after the game so we went directly to Die 
		Kellar where we had a table booked for later on anyway. Despite the 
		disappointment, we had a good night in there with a good meal and plenty 
		of alcohol. We left there at about 11 and got taxis back to the hotel.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 18 - Monday, 28th June</span>
        We were up at 7 as Mark and Steve wanted an early 
		start to get back to Durban for the Holland v Slovakia game. They 
		departed after breakfast while we went back to bed for an hour or so. We 
		had planned to leave at 9:30 but Dave's visit to &quot;The Cheetah 
		Experience&quot; meant that our departure got delayed until 10:40. It was an 
		uneventful journey back with me and Fred sharing the driving. Arrived 
		back in Scottburgh just after 6 with Mark and Steve getting back not 
		long after. This completed a round trip for us of more than 2,600 km 
		since we left last Tuesday. None of us could be bothered to go out and 
		eat so we got a takeaway from KFC and stayed in to watch Brazil v Chile 
		(although inevitably, my interest in the football is not too high at the 
		moment)</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 19 - Tuesday, 29th June</span>
        Roz, Mark and I were up early again as we had 
		booked to go diving again. We were at the dive centre, in our wetsuits 
		with our gear on the boat when the decision was made that the sea was 
		too rough to launch the boat. This was disappointing especially for Mark 
		as he thought that this was to be the only day he could dive before going home. It meant 
		a day with not a lot to do which did not turn out too badly. We were 
		able to sort out plans for the next few days, catch up with our e-mails 
		and generally laze around doing nothing - something we have not had a 
		lot of chance to do fro the last week or so. Mark trid to change his and 
		Dave's flights so that they could go home early but could only move them 
		a few days. They will now fly home on the same day as us a week on 
		Thursday.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_9100.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We had all booked flights in advance to Cape Town in 
		case England got to the quarter final. Roz and I have decided to go to 
		Sodwana Bay for&nbsp; a few days diving instead and will probably head 
		there tomorrow after diving. The others will still go to Cape Town 
		(Steve, Fred and Dave all have tickets for Germany v Argentina) and will 
		go to Imfolosi National Park for a couple of days tomorrow. We have just 
		about decided to not bother with the sardine run after discussing this 
		option with Karen at Oceanworx.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">In the evening we all went to the French restaurant 
		recommended by Dick, our dive guide at Ocenaworx. We had an excellent 
		meal and a few bottles of wine and then went to The Tin Roof to watch 
		Spain v Portugal. Ended up drinking more than planned and was quite 
		pissed by the end of the evening.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 20 - Wednesday, 30th June </span>
        Only Roz and I had planned to dive today but once 
		again, it was an aborted trip. This time we got as far as the beach 
		before the decision was made so another frustrating morning. We went 
		back to the house and saw the others off when they departed for Imfolosi 
		at 10 (This was the last we see of Steve as he flies home on Sunday). We left an hour or so later for the 4.5 hour drive to Sodwana 
		Bay. We arrived at Da Blue Juice by about 4pm and were shown to our 
		cabin. It seemed a nice enough place for a few days. We have a six 
		person cabin to ourselves. It is fairly basic but has kitchen and 
		bathroom and a really nice balcony area. After an hour or so of lounging 
		around in hammocks, we had a few glasses of wine before going across the 
		road for a pizza. We stayed in the restaurant after eating as they were 
		showing the cricket from England and for the second night running, ended 
		up drinking more than we had planned.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 21 - Thursday, 1st July </span>
		We were woken at about 3 by heavy rain which had started coming through 
		our roof in several places. We got a phone call at 7:30 to say the 
		diving was in doubt but were called back after 8 to say that they were 
		going ahead. We could not have breakfast as water in the kitchen area 
		had caused the electricity to go off. We drove down to the beach and 
		found Da Blue Juice. The weather was still terrible. There was no let up 
		in the rain, the skies were totally grey and the wind was starting to 
		pick up. This all meant that we would only be able to do one dive.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_0372.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We dived on Two Mile Reef. The site was nice enough 
		without being too spectacular - plenty of leaf scorpion fish and a few 
		other reef fish we have not seen further South. Back on the beach we 
		found out that our electric was unlikely to work for up to three days so 
		Michelle booked us a room at the lodge next door. This did not work out 
		too badly as this was a much nicer room and with the rain still coming 
		down, we were to spend a lot of time in it. We had lunch in the lodge 
		restaurant and spent the rest of the afternoon in the room not doing a 
		lot. We have been very lucky with the weather so far on this trip so we 
		were probably due a couple of bad days. We are planning on two more days 
		up here but will head back to Scottburgh if things do not improve 
		tomorrow.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">The rain had stopped by early evening but we could 
		not be bothered to go out to eat in case in started again. Ate at the 
		lodge restaurant again and had a better meal than last night.</p>
