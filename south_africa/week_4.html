        <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 22 - Friday, 2nd July </span>
        A much better day than yesterday. There was a lot of 
		rain during the night but it had stopped by the time we left to go to 
		the beach. By the time we left for the first dive, the sun was starting 
		to shine and the cloud finally began to clear. The conditions had 
		improved sufficiently for us to be able to get out to Nine Mile Reef 
		which was a better dive site than yesterday's. The journeys to and from 
		the dive site were eventful with dolphins and a manta being spotted on 
		the way out. On the return, a whale shark was spotted and we were able 
		to get off the boat and snorkel with it for about five minutes. It was a 
		small whale shark, similar in size to the one we have seen in Thailand 
		but an incredible experience nonetheless. The second dive was also good 
		with plenty to see.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We were back in our room to watch the Holland v Brazil game but did not 
		do much for the rest of the day. We had a few drinks before eating in 
		the lodge restaurant again. We returned to the room for the Uruguay v 
		Ghana game but we could hardly stay awake during the first 90 minutes 
		and both fell asleep before extra time had started.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_2455_2.jpg"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 23 - Saturday, 3rd July </span>
        Another good couple of dives to 
		end our visit to Sodwana Bay. We also got to snorkel with dolphins on 
		the way out to the first dive site. The diving has been different here 
		to Aliwal Shoal and it has been well worth coming up for a couple of 
		days. </p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		By the time we had completed the second dive and collected our luggage 
		from the lodge, it was gone 3:30. The drive back to Scottburgh was easy 
		enough and we were back at the police station just before 8 to collect 
		the keys to the house. Unfortunately, the keys were not there as there 
		had been some confusion and the cleaner had picked them up and taken 
		them home. This took about 30 minutes to resolve so we did not get in 
		until 8:30. We were both pretty knackered but made the effort to go out 
		to the French restaurant again. Another very good meal and we made it 
		home in time for the last 15 minutes of the Spain v Paraguay game.</p>
		
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 24 - Sunday, 4th July </span>
        Back to Oceanworx for two more 
		dives. The first was a a wreck we have not dived before. It was a 
		relatively challenging dive. The wreck is in about 30m to 20m, the light 
		was not good and the currents were fairly strong. It was still a good 
		dive and something I would happily dive again. The second dive was more 
		like the usual dives in this area - three turtles, at least three 
		raggies and plenty of other fish. We had finished by midday as they 
		start early at weekends so had the rest of the day lazing around the 
		house. We caught up with washing, logbook writing etc but did not do a 
		lot else. It was good to have some time not doing anything after the 
		last couple of days.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We went out for a curry in the evening and were back in the house 
		finishing the remaining wine when Mark, Dave and Fred returned at 10 
		(Steve was by now on his way home to England). We spent about an hour 
		discussing our respective trips and plans for the next week before 
		heading to bed just after 11.</p>
        
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 25 - Monday, 5th July </span>
        Another day of diving - this time 
		with Mark. He had dived in the aquarium on their trip to Cape Town but 
		these were his first dives in the sea. The first dive was not wonderful 
		- we missed the site, the vis was poor and the current relatively 
		strong. The second was a lot better with good views of raggies and Mark 
		managed to find a turtle!</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		Back &quot;home&quot; just after 1 and another fairly lazy afternoon. Plenty of 
		discussions about the plans for the next couple of days. Mark has tried 
		unsuccessfully to change his flight home to tomorrow, Fred tried 
		unsuccessfully to buy tickets for the semi final in Durban on Wednesday. 
		Roz and I will definitely dive for another two days and may try and go 
		to the semi. The discovery of the fact that Croc World has meerkats and 
		tortoises to look at means that this has been added to our itinerary for 
		tomorrow.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We ate at The Tin Roof for the first time in a while, and returned to 
		the house to watch Dave's shark cage DVD's!</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_2523.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 26 - Tuesday, 6th July </span>
        Roz and I were driven to the dive 
		centre by Fred as Mark was not diving and Fred wanted the car to go into 
		Durban. The two dives today were excellent despite poor vis and strong 
		currents. We somehow managed to dive the same site twice - Northern 
		Pinnacles. The first dive was&nbsp; very good with four or five turtles, 
		more raggies and an eagle ray that swam right beneath me - too close to 
		get in a photo. The second was similar with three more turtles and about 
		the same number of raggies. At the end of the second dive, as we were 
		getting low on bottom time, we drifted away from the reef towards the 
		area where a shark dive had been taking place. Dick (our guide for the 
		last time) spent ten minutes or so trying to attract sharks to us. Not 
		much happened for a while but by the end of the dive, we had six or 
		seven oceanic black tips swimming around us - a definite highlight of 
		the diving here.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_9139.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">After 
		we had cleaned our gear, we rang Mark to come and collect us. We drove 
		directly from Umkomaas to Croc World which is on the way back to 
		Scottburgh. The crocodiles were more impressive than I thought they 
		would be and there were also a lot more of them than I had expected. 
		There were loads of them in several pens covering quite a large area. We 
		seemed very close to them despite being separated by fences. They were 
		far bigger than the ones we had seen in the game reserve and all looked 
		quite unreal. The highlight of the park, however was the meerkats. We 
		spent more time looking at them than the crocodiles and taking pictures 
		and generally commenting on their cuteness. Next to the meerkats was a 
		tortoise enclosure which kept Roz amused for another twenty minutes or 
		so! By the time we had walked round everything and spent some time 
		buying meerkat t-shirts, it was getting on for about 3:30. We returned 
		to the house for a late lunch and another afternoon of not doing a lot.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		Mark drove us to the &quot;Sports Club&quot; to eat and watch the first semi-final 
		and we were back home and in bed not long after it finished.</p>

		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 27 - Wednesday, 7th July </span>
        Our last day of diving before 
		flying home. The dives were OK but no-where near as good as yesterday. 
		The weather was poor - windy and no sun - so the conditions were about 
		the worse we have had here. This was a bit unfortunate for Mark, who did 
		not dive yesterday but and was ill for most of the trip today. It was a 
		two tank trip but he only did the first dive so spent about four hours 
		on the boat for less than 40 minutes underwater. Despite the dives not 
		being wonderful, the second dive ended with a large turtle swimming up 
		from where it had been woken so a good way to end our diving.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We were back at the house by just after 2:00 and dithered about a bit 
		deciding what to do for the rest of the day. Fred and Dave were 
		definitely going in to Durban to try and get tickets for the semi-final 
		- the rest of us were undecided. We had planned to go in and see if we 
		could get cheap tickets close to kick-off but by the time we were back 
		from diving I could not really be bothered. Everyone else was keen 
		however, so after a quick shower, we all headed into Durban. We took 
		both cars as it was always likely that three of us would be coming back 
		to watch the game in Scottburgh.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_9155.JPG"></div>
        
		<p  class="diary-text">It took about an hou>r to get into Durban and park the car. We walked to 
		the beach area and had a late lunch at an excellent Indian restaurant. 
		We then spent an hour or so walking towards the ground, taking photos 
		and asking about ticket prices. The ground itself did look very 
		impressive and the atmosphere was pretty good. However, the vuvuzelas 
		were still annoying and the whole thing was a bit of a depressing 
		reminder of what it could of been like if we had not played so badly. 
		There were plenty of tickets around, mostly Cat 1 tickets going for 
		R2000 (about &pound;180). Myself, Roz and Mark were not interested in tickets 
		at this price but by the time we had reached the ground Fred and Dave 
		managed to get two Cat 2 tickets for R3500. Just after 6, the three of 
		us without tickets gave up and started walking back to the car. We would 
		probably have got cheaper tickets if we had waited longer but we did not 
		want to end up in Durban at kick-off time without tickets so were all 
		just as happy to go back and watch it The Tin Roof.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We made it back to Scottburgh by 8:15 and were in the pub by kick-off 
		time at 8:30. It turned into quite a good night. We stayed in the pub 
		until the game finished and returned to the house to finish the 
		remaining wine. Fred and Dave were back before 12 and I vaguely remember 
		getting to bed at around 2am.</p>

		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 28 - Thursday, 8th July </span>
        We were up reasonably early 
		considering what time we went to bed. We had to leave Scottburgh today 
		to drive back to Johannesburg for flights home. We left the house at 
		9:30. It had been a superb place to stay and had been a very good 
		choice. It was quite sad to be finally leaving.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We drove via Umkomaas and called into Ocenworx to pay the remainder of 
		our diving bill with the cash we had saved by not going to the football 
		(in fact, most of our diving has been paid for with money that we have 
		saved by not going to football!). 
		We were on our way from the dive centre by 10. Again the journey was 
		uneventful. We stopped at the same service station we had visited on our 
		way down, three and a half weeks ago for something to eat and got to the 
		airport by 5. We filled the cars with petrol and returned them to 
		Budget. We then seemed to spend a couple of hours standing in queues 
		waiting to get things sorted out. There were a few problems in the car 
		hire office, we had to queue to check in and there were three different 
		places to visit to claim the VAT refund on the things we had bought in 
		South Africa. Even buying duty free seemed to be an incredibly long and 
		drawn out process. We said our goodbyes to the others - Mark and Dave 
		were going home via Zurich, Fred flying back to the States - and went to 
		the gate for our flight to Madrid. This eventually left about 45 minutes 
		late at 9:10 by which time we were both totally knackered. The drive had 
		not been too bad but sorting everything out at the airport seemed to 
		take it out of us and we could not even be bothered to go and get 
		anything to eat or drink.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We had a few bottles of wine on the plane as usual and got to sleep by 
		about 1am.</p>

		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 29 - Friday, 9th July </span>
        We landed in Madrid just after 7 
		and had got the metro into the centre of the city by 9. Luckily, the 
		hotel we had booked was next to the metro station exit (my dive bag is 
		not that easy to carry) and, better still, they had a room available 
		immediately. We had much needed showers and headed off for a walk. </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_9182.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We 
		stopped for breakfast and walked to Plaza Del Sol which is only about 
		five minutes away. We did not really have any sights that we wanted to 
		see but spent most of our time looking for a bar that we had drank in 
		when we were here for the England friendly a few years ago. When we 
		finally located it, we returned to the hotel and spent an hour or so by 
		the pool. We had lunch at a tapas bar round the corner from the hotel 
		before a three hour siesta to catch up on much needed sleep.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><p align="justify">
		We had a very good evening out in Madrid. It started with the discovery 
		that we had been upgraded to a &quot;Club Emporador&quot; room that entitled us to 
		unlimited free beer! We had access to a lounge which had a self service 
		beer tap and free nibbles. We stayed in there for a few drinks before 
		starting a pub crawl around the bars of Madrid. We managed to visit 
		about eight different bars and got back to the hotel sometime after 
		2:00. A very enjoyable last day of the holiday.</p>
