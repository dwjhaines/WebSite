        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 0 - Thursday, 10th June </span>
        Arrived at Heathrow at 4ish to be told that our 
		17:30 flight to Madrid was delayed by 40 minutes. We had about five 
		hours to kill in Madrid so this was not a big problem. We 
		went through security and found that real ale is available in Terminal 3 for the 
		first time in about 15 years, so sat in the bar and waited. The flight 
		continued to be delayed and eventually took off at about 20:00. 
		Uneventful flight to Madrid. We got to the terminal in Madrid by 23:30 
		to find out that the onward flight to Johannesburg was also delayed, 
		until 3:30. We were not overjoyed at this but after a few beers in the 
		bar with plenty of other fans (mainly from USA, South and Central 
		America) we had quite an enjoyable wait. The flight left at 3:30 and was 
		also pretty good. We counted fans from 13 different countries and after 
		a few more drinks, we got to sleep at about 6ish.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 1 - Friday, 11th June </span>
        We were woken for breakfast at about 11:30 and 
		eventually landed in Johannesburg at 1:30. Everything at the airport 
		went remarkably smoothly. We had to collect our tickets for the first 
		three games from ticket machines - we had read about people having to 
		queue for up to an hour but the whole thing took about a minute. We 
		activated our MTN SIM cards, took out money and collected our hire car. 
		Within about an hour we were on our way out of the airport. We got to 
		Idube Lodge without any problems, dumped our luggage in the room and 
		went to meet Mark, Steve and Dave who had all arrived either yesterday 
		or earlier today.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_8671.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We arrived at a bar about 10 minutes from where we were staying just in 
		time for kick-off in the first game of the tournament. There was a 
		pretty good atmosphere in the bar with plenty of South Africans watching 
		the game as well as a group of Australians from Idube and a few fans 
		from other countries. The South Africans all seemed to be enjoying 
		themselves but the vuvuzelas are already becoming irritating! After 
		returning to Idube for showers, we watched the second game of the day in 
		a restaurant before heading home. The area we are staying (Melville) seems safe 
		enough and is OK for wandering around at night in a group of five but 
		not the sort of place you would want to walk round on your own.</p>
	
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 2 - Saturday, 12th June </span>
        We had breakfast in Idube, wandered out to a nearby 
		shopping mall for a few things and started heading towards Rustenburg at 
		about 1. There was a bit of indecision about the route to take but after 
		advice from Trish, the owner of the lodge, we took the direct route 
		instead of the main toll roads. This was probably not the best of 
		choices but did not work out too badly. Certainly not a route you would 
		want to take at night and we all agreed it would be the toll road after 
		the game.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_8699.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We got to Rustenburg at 3:30ish and after driving through the town, 
		which looked pretty horrendous, we decided to go and park near the 
		ground and spend the rest of the time there drinking the beer that we 
		had bought with us. Unfortunately, FIFA had blocked the main access road 
		to the ground for their officials meaning that the only option for 
		getting to the ground appeared to be a park and ride. We returned to the 
		town centre, ate at the KFC (this really was the best option available) 
		and had a couple of our beers stood 
		outside what appeared to be the only bar in town. It was next to a tombstone shop which seemed quite 
		appropriate. There were a few England fans around but most seemed to 
		have had the sense to avoid the town altogether.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		At 5ish we headed to the park and ride which looked incredibly badly 
		organised. It was a huge field about 10 miles from the ground with space 
		for thousands of cars and two single track exits. Parking and getting on 
		a bus was not too bad but we were all concerned about how long it was 
		going to take to get out. Predictions for the time it would take to get 
		out started at about four hours!</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The atmosphere at the ground itself was pretty good. We had a couple 
		more of our beers outside and then got into the ground relatively 
		painlessly. Roz and I were in a different part of the ground to the 
		others having paid $80 for our tickets instead of $160. There was no 
		restrictions in the ground about where you could go so spent the hour 
		before kick-off with them before heading to our seats (although we 
		rejoined them for the second half as seats in front of them were empty)</p>
        <div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_8695.JPG"></div>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		Not too much to say about the game! At final whistle, we legged it 
		around the ground and were incredibly lucky. We headed to the area for 
		the park and ride buses and spotted a gap in a fence where people 
		appeared to be jumping the queue. There was no official organisation at 
		all but somehow the five of us managed to get on a bus that was already 
		completely packed. Back at the car park, there was a similar level of 
		organisation but we managed to find a path through the parked cars and 
		were heading out of one of the exits about 35 minutes after the game had 
		finished. We took the toll road back to Johannesburg and were back in 
		Idube by 1:10, just as the local radio was reporting stories of people 
		still being stuck in the car-park.</p>

		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 3 - Sunday, 13th June </span>
        We departed in two cars at 10ish heading for 
		Durban. Steve and Dave were in one car as they were going to the Germany 
		v Australia game while the rest of us were going directly to Scottburgh 
		where we are based for the next four weeks. We had a few problems 
		getting out of Johannesburg but once on the N3 to Durban, the 650km 
		journey was relatively straightforward. We had one stop for lunch and 
		arrived in Scottburgh at about 4:30. We collected the keys for our 
		house and got in with no problems.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The house was excellent and probably better than we had hoped for. It 
		was bigger and probably nicer than we had all been expecting. Our 
		bedroom was huge, Mark claimed the other double leaving Dave and Steve 
		to share the room with the bunk beds. The three of us were very happy! 
		We had a quick walk around Scottburgh which also seemed ideal. It all 
		seems a lot safer than Johannesburg, and has everything we could 
		possibly need within easy walking distance. We bought a few provisions, 
		went back for showers and then headed out to The Tin Roof Pub which will 
		probably be our local for the next few weeks. Very cheap beer and they 
		were happy to order takeaway pizzas as they were not serving food. We 
		watched the game there before returning to the house and had an early 
		night (apart from being woken at 12:10 when Steve and Dave returned from 
		the game)</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 4 - Monday, 14th June </span>
        Roz, Mark and I were up at 6. We had to wake Dave 
		up to let us out of the electronic gate and the three of us headed off 
		to Umkomass and the Oceanworx dive centre. It was the same place we had 
		dived from seven years ago but with new owners and a new name. We had 
		booked two dives which for Mark were the first two dives of his open 
		water course.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/CRW_2325.jpg"></div>
        We got our gear together in the dive centre and were taken down to the 
		beach from where the boat was launched. There were ten of us on the boat 
		- Dick the dive guide, seven fun divers and Mark with his instructor. 
		The two dives included a trip back to the beach to get new tanks. Both 
		dives were pretty good. The vis was not wonderful - similar to what we 
		remember from last time we were here - but there was loads to see. There 
		were plenty of &quot;raggies&quot; around on both dives and a total of four 
		turtles. The one at the start of the second dive were particularly high 
		quality one. I also got a brief glimpse of a pod of dolphins which I 
		have not seen on a dive before.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We were back at the dive centre by about 1 and had an hour or so wait 
		while Mark had a session in the pool. Did not do too much for the rest 
		of the day. We walked around Scottburgh again, had an early meal in The 
		Tin Roof and returned to the house for the second half of Italy v 
		Paraguay. Totally knackered so went straight to bed immediately after 
		the game</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 5 - Tuesday, 15th June </span>A relatively quiet day. The three of us were up at 
		6 again to go diving but just as we were about to leave, we got a phone 
		call saying that the weather was too bad and the trip was cancelled. 
		This did not come as a big surprise as we had been woken at 4:30 strong 
		winds and the sea did look pretty rough.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		After a couple of hours back in bed, the rest of the morning was spent 
		trying to get some sort of plan for the second round. We are all (apart 
		from Steve) desperately hoping that England do not win their group as 
		this would mean another trip to Rustenburg. There are plenty of horror 
		stories around of peoples return to Johannesburg on Saturday and the 
		thought of having to drive there again is not appealing. The chances of 
		us having the same luck when leaving the ground as last time are very 
		slim and it would also involve an additional 1000km or so in the car, 
		expensive accommodation and a return to the worst town any of us have 
		been to to watch a football match. Bloemfontein would be a lot easier 
		all round and all we really achieved was agreement that this would be a 
		better option.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We went out at lunchtime to an excellent Indian cafe and then spent an 
		hour using the internet. While we were doing this, Dave managed to fall 
		over somewhere injuring his ankle in the process. Not sure if it is 
		sprained or fractured (an x-ray may be required) but the doctor who 
		treated him may have spare tickets for tomorrow nights game in Durban. 
		We were keen on this game but may not be able to go if Mark's course 
		finishes late tomorrow. We watched the Portugal v Ivory Coast 4pm game 
		in the house and did not really do much else. Tried a different pub for 
		our evening meal and returned to the house for Brazil v N. Korea</p>
		
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 6 - Wednesday, 16th June </span>
        The three of us were up early again but at 6:30, we 
		got another phone call from the dive centre. This time, they were still 
		going out but the conditions were still too bad for Mark to be able to 
		finish his course so Roz and I headed off on our own. The conditions 
		were worse than on Monday and the boat journeys to and from the sites 
		were pretty rough. There was also a lot of surge and current when we got 
		to the sites but the dives were still pretty good. We dived at Cathedral 
		and Manta Point. Loads of raggies again, particularly on the first dive 
		and another three turtles (four for Roz). Back at the dive centre by 
		about 2.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We had hoped to go to the Spain v Switzerland game in Durban today but 
		did not finish diving until it was too late. Mark was able to go due his 
		diving being cancelled so he and Steve had driven into Durban by the 
		time we got back to the house.</p>
	
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 7 - Thursday, 17th June </span>Left Scottburgh at 10 for the hour drive to Durban 
		airport. We were on the 13:10 flight to Cape Town and took off about 40 
		minutes late. We were met at the airport in Cape Town by a taxi 
		organised by the place we were staying at and arrived at Brenwin Guest 
		House by about 4pm. We dumped our stuff in our room and Roz and I headed 
		straight out to have a look around.</p>

		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_8717.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We 
		were staying a 15 minute walk from the V &amp; A Waterfront. As soon as we 
		were down there, Cape Town seemed a superb place. There area was packed 
		with restaurants and souvenir shops, there were loads of football fans 
		from different countries all around the area watching the afternoon 
		games and everywhere we went, we had excellent view of Table Mountain. 
		The whole area had an excellent atmosphere and felt very safe. The 
		contrast between here and Rustenburg could not have been greater. </p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We met up with the others and headed into the Paulaner Haus which would 
		not of looked out of place in Munich and had a typically German meal 
		with plenty of wheat beer. A very enjoyable evening.</p>
