        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 8 - Friday, 18th June</span>
        <p  class="diary-text">We were up for breakfast at 8 and had ordered a 
		taxi to take us to Table Mountain at 8:15. We were incredibly lucky with 
		the weather for our stay in Cape Town. The forecast we had seen showed 
		clear, sunny weather for today, tomorrow and Sunday with cloud and rain 
		on the days either side. As today was clear, we wanted&nbsp; to get up 
		Table Mountain as soon as possible so we could experience it without the 
		thick cloud that covers it for most of the winter. We were dropped at 
		the lower cable car station just after 8:30 and after queuing for about 
		10 minutes, bought our tickets and caught the cable car up to the top. 
		The ride up to the top in a cable car complete with rotating floor was 
		very spectacular - the views of Cape Town from the top were even better. 
		We stayed at the top for and hour or so taking countless pictures of the 
		city below (particularly of the stadium) and the views South towards the 
		Cape of Good Hope. It was a bit windy up there but we really could not 
		of asked for a much better day to be there as we had completely 
		unobstructed 360 views. The whole thing was very high up in 
		the list of best sights we have ever been to.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/CRW_2350.jpg"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We 
		got a taxi back to the guest house by midday and headed off to the Cape 
		Town Aquarium shortly afterwards. Roz and I had booked a dive in the 
		predator tank with sharks rays and a turtle. I had not been over keen on 
		this idea but it was another very enjoyable experience. We were given a 
		short dive brief by Iain, the Scottish dive guide and were then led 
		through the aquarium to the area at the top of the tank. We geared up 
		with two other customers before climbing into the top of the tank. We 
		all dropped down to the floor of the tank and spent 35 minutes watching 
		the sharks and rays swimming above us. I had a very close encounter with 
		the resident turtle and another with a large feather-tail ray. We were 
		also able to get very good close up photos of the raggies swimming 
		overhead. While we were doing this we had Mark, Steve and Dave watching 
		from the viewing area outside the tank.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">The others had left the aquarium by the 
		time we had finished. We went back to the guest house to get rid of our 
		diving stuff and then returned to the waterfront for a late lunch and a 
		few beers. We ate at a South African restaurant with superb views of 
		Table Mountain and then headed to the Paulaner Haus for a few more wheat 
		beers.
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_8794.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We 
		started heading to the ground at 7ish and, despite the organisation not 
		being too clever, we got into the ground by 8 in time for the 8:30 
		kick-off. The stadium was very impressive and up to this point, it had 
		been an excellent day. However, the football was awful, probably the 
		worst performance I have seen from England in a competitive game. It was 
		hard to believe just how bad we were capable of playing and leaving the 
		ground, it felt as if we had just been knocked out. We are not out of 
		the tournament yet but it is going to take a huge improvement if we are 
		going to get much further. At least we may not have to go back to 
		Rustenburg.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">We had a couple more beers in the bar near 
		the guest house after the game but we were not really in the mood for 
		drinking and we were back in bed not long after midnight. All in all, a 
		superb day out despite the football!</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 9 - Saturday, 19th June </span>
        <p  class="diary-text">The remaining Cape Town attraction that we were 
		keen on was the penguins at Boulders. There were a few options for us to 
		get there but we eventually decided to get a taxi for the whole day. 
		This worked out at R1500 which was less than &pound;30 each between the five 
		of us. Mark was keen on the train option so went on ahead. We arranged 
		to pick him up at Simons Town. The taxi picked the rest of us up just 
		after 10.
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_8820.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">The 
		journey down to Boulder was pretty scenic so we had plenty of photo 
		stops en-route. Mark's train journey was not as long as expected as 
		there were engineering works and he had to complete the trip using a 
		replacement bus service! We were all dropped off at Boulder just after 
		11 and headed off to see the penguins. This was another attraction that 
		was well worth the visit. The viewing area consisted of a couple of 
		boardwalks leading away from the visitor centre to the beach. As soon as 
		we started walking on the boardwalks, we could see penguins. They were 
		all over the place and there were plenty of females with their young. We 
		spent about an hour taking photos and generally commenting about how 
		cute they were. We all ended up buying stuff from the souvenir shop 
		before heading off again. We had timed it very well as bus loads of 
		Brazilians were arriving and filling the place up as we were leaving. </p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The taxi took us from Boulder down the coast to the Cape of Good Hope 
		Nature Reserve.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_8853.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">This 
		was superb again and the views were a lot more impressive than I had 
		expected. We were dropped in the car park at Cape Point and set off to 
		walk up to the lighthouse. A few minutes into the walk, Mark had his bag 
		snatched by a Baboon. His shout of &quot;there's nothing in it&quot; did not seem 
		to have any effect! I managed to get the bag back by standing on it at 
		which point the baboon gave up but all very entertaining nonetheless. 
		After admiring the views from the lighthouse, we 
		headed along the trail to the Cape of Good Hope. It was a very scenic 
		walk and got us away from the majority of the tourists. Dave's was 
		struggling with his ankle a bit but other than that it was an easy 
		enough walk and it took us about an hour to get along the trail to where 
		the taxi was waiting to pick us up. The drive back to Green Point took 
		us along the West Coast of the Cape which again was very spectacular. We 
		were back at the guest house by 6 and it had been another excellent day. 
		Cape Town has been a brilliant city to visit and the fact that we have 
		had good weather was incredibly lucky.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		Roz and I went straight out to the Paulaner Haus for a couple of beers. 
		We were joined by the others and spent the remainder of the evening in a 
		Belgium restaurant. We had a very good meal and several Belgium beers - 
		a very good end to our stay here.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_0068.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 10 - Sunday, 20th June </span>
        <p  class="diary-text">We were collected by a taxi just before 9 and taken 
		to the airport for the 10:35 flight back to Durban. Since the start of 
		the trip, we have been taking photos of Lee being held by fans of the 
		different countries playing in the world cup. Cape Town has been 
		particularly good for this game as there have been a lot of fans around 
		from different countries. At the airport, we reached the half way point. 
		A picture of him with a Brazilian fan meant that we have pictures of him 
		with fans of half the countries taking part. Sixteen more to go 
		although some could prove a bit more difficult as teams start to get 
		knocked out.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The flight back was quite scenic and I had excellent views of Cape Town 
		as we left. We touched down in Port Elizabeth on the way but were back 
		in Durban by 2ish. We were in Scottburgh an hour or so later. Roz had 
		been talking to Karen at the dive centre about whether or not Dave would 
		be able to do a DSD tomorrow. At about 3:30, she asked us if we wanted 
		to do a night dive as the conditions were very good. Roz was keen, so an 
		hour later, we headed out again. The dive was OK but quite different to 
		other night dives we have done. It was similar to the day dives we have 
		done here - several raggies and a turtle - but there was not many of the 
		things we usually see at night.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We did not go out to eat - the others had bought steak and chips to cook 
		when we got back - we stayed in the house and watched the football.</p>
		
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 11 - Monday, 21st June</span>
        We were all up early and headed of 
		to the dive centre at 6:45. Mark was finishing his open water course, 
		Steve was doing a DSD and Dave was planning to go out and snorkel as he 
		had still not managed to find out if he could dive on the blood pressure 
		tablets he was taking. At the dive centre he was told by a doctor that 
		he could do the pool session of the DSD but should not actually dive in 
		the sea. He was happy with this and joined Steve to get ready for the 
		pool as we headed out on the boat</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We had two good dives again - plenty of raggies and we maintained our 
		record of seeing turtles on every dive here. Steve joined us on the 
		second dive during which Mark completed his open water course.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We all returned to Scottburgh and did not do a lot for the rest of the 
		day. The football was on the tele but I don't think any of us managed to 
		stay awake through both of the afternoon games. We ate at the Tin Roof 
		again in the evening and had a few drinks more than usual but were still 
		in bed before 12.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 12 - Tuesday, 22nd June </span>
        Mark, Steve and Dave had booked 
		flights to Port Elizabeth where we play our third group game tomorrow. 
		They departed for the airport at about 7:30. We had decided to drive and 
		left just before 9. The drive was 920km in total. We had arranged to 
		pick up Fred at East London airport about two thirds of the way along. 
		We had a half hour lunch stop and arrived at East London by 5. We were 
		able to watch the second half of the South Africa v France game in the 
		airport Wimpy before Fred arrived at about 6:30. We added Fred's name to 
		the car hire agreement and continued to Port Elizabeth. By 10 we had 
		checked into Park Place Hotel. We could not be bothered to go out 
		anywhere after the day in the car so were in bed by 11.</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_8892.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 13 - Wednesday, 23rd June </span>
        <p  class="diary-text">Mark, Steve and Dave had booked 
		a morning trip to Addo Elephant National Park. Roz, Fred and I are 
		driving there tomorrow so were able to spend the morning at the beach 
		front area of Port Elizabeth. We got a taxi down to the beach and spent 
		an hour or so walking down to the Boardwalk area. This area was a packed 
		with shops and restaurants. It had a bit of a Disney type feel to it all 
		but was full of football fans - mainly English - and had a pretty good 
		atmosphere. We sat around in the sun and had a couple of beers and after 
		getting something to eat headed towards the ground at about 1:30. We got 
		a taxi to the stadium and after another couple of beers in a bar just 
		round the corner from the ground, were in the ground by 3:00, an hour 
		before kick-off. We met up with the others briefly before splitting up 
		again as our seats were all in different parts of the ground.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		The game was not wonderful but was a big improvement on the previous 
		performance and given what was at stake, was pretty exciting. The win 
		meant that we had qualified and the news from the USA game as we left 
		the ground meant that we had finished second in the group and would be 
		going to Bloemfontein and not Rustenburg. This was the perfect set of 
		results for all of us (except Fred who has a ticket for the Rustenburg 
		game but not the one in Bloemfontein).</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We got a shuttle bus back to the area where our hotel is and all got a 
		lift back to the hotel with the owner who happened to be on the same 
		bus. After a bit of time looking into Bloemfontein accommodation, we 
		went out to a B.Y.O. Thai restaurant where we had an excellent meal with 
		a few beers and a box of wine. The scores from the other games tonight 
		mean that the game in Bloemfontein will be against Germany!</p>
		<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="Photos/IMG_8935.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Day 14 - Thursday, 24th June </span>
		Fred, Roz and I departed PE just after 8 and headed up to Addo Elephant 
		National Park. We got to our guest house in Addo by 9:30 and at 10 we 
		were picked up by one of the guides. We were driven to the park entrance 
		where we transferred to another tour that had come up from PE. The first 
		game drive was in a minibus with 11 others plus guide and driver. The 
		drive was very good although the minibus was not the ideal vehicle for 
		such things. There was plenty to see, including various antelope, 
		warthogs, a dung beetle and a leopard tortoise. We also had very good 
		views of the elephants.</p>
		<p  class="diary-text">
		We were driven from Addo to Schotia Game reserve where we had lunch 
		before being taken on our second drive of the day. This drive was better 
		as there were only five of us in an open back land rover. The views were 
		much better and it was more similar to the previous safaris we had done. 
		Once again, there was plenty to see.
		<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="Photos/IMG_8961.JPG"></div>
        <p  class="diary-text">We 
		came across four lions almost as soon as we entered the reserve and were 
		able to view them from about 10m away. They were not doing a lot but an 
		incredible experience nonetheless. Plenty more to see including 
		giraffes, a close encounter with a couple of crocodiles and a couple of 
		white rhino. Stunning scenery throughout both the days drives and a 
		highly enjoyable day. We were given our evening meal in a camp type 
		thing in the reserve before being driven back to Addo by the woman who 
		had picked us up in the morning.</p>
