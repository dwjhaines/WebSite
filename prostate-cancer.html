              While in Bacharach, I received a text message inviting my to book an appointment to have a PSA test carried out to check for possible prostate cancer.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Fri 19th July</span>
              On our way home from Berlin, I phoned up and got an appointment for the test for next week.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 25th July</span>
              Had the blood test with the nurse in Kingsclere.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Monday 5th August</span>
              I had a phone call from Dr Robinson telling me that my PSA levels were raised. I was already booked in for a second blood test which I had this morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              PSA Levels were 8.66 and 9.49.

              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 6th August</span>
              I had a phone appointment with a urology nurse (Precious) who asked me a lot of questions and booked me in for an MRI scan for Sunday. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 9th August</span>
              Had my MRI scan at Basingstoke hospital. A relatively painless if not very pleasant experience.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 20th August</span>
              I had been told that I would have to have a biopsy to determine whether or not I had cancer. I had a few questions and sent Precious an e-mail. She called me back and told me that the MRI scan had come back with a Likert score of 5 meaning that it was "very likely" that I had cancer that would require treatment. This was probably the first time that I considered the possibility that I really did have cancer.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 25th August</span>
              We went to Basingstoke for the biopsy. This was a particularly unpleasant experience. I had been reading up on it for a few days and had been getting quite stressed about it all. Although it was a slightly painful and very un-dignified hour or so, I felt very relieved afterwards that it was over. The doctor had confirmed that it was very likely to be cancer.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
			  <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 3rd September</span>
              We were heading over to Ireland for six nights due to England playing in Dublin on Saturday. I had arranged a telephone consultation with a doctor regarding the biopsy. He phoned me while we were sat in departures and confirmed that I did have prostate cancer. We had been fairly aware that this was likely since the biopsy but the diagnosis was worse than expected (Gleason 4+5) and will require more tests to see if it has spread outside the prostrate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 6th September</span>
              Tuesday's news had started to have a bit more of an impact on us both in the last 24 hours. I was starting to get quite worried about it all, neither of us are sleeping well and Roz in particular is getting quite stressed about the lack of updates or news about what is happening next. I had been given a number to call if I had any questions and tried ringing at 9. I had to leave a message to get them to call me back but eventually did get to speak to one of the cancer nurses (Precious, again).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              She was quite reassuring and explained that there was no urgency to get anything done and I should hear something within the next two or three weeks. She also told me that the chances of the cancer having spread outside the prostate is very low and this is unlikely to change while I wait for further tests (the next step is a PET scan). Three days of worrying about the diagnosis had probably made things seem a lot worse than they really are and we were both feeling a lot happier about things as a result of this phone call.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Monday 9th September</span>
              After getting beck from Ireland, I had a phone call telling me that I had a PET scan booked for Guildford on Thursday. This causes a few problems for our trip to Greece but we were relieved to get the appointment so quickly.
            </p>
						<p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 11th September</span>
              I spoke to Elfan this afternoon. He had a prostatectomy 13 years ago and it was quite a reassuring conversation. The way he talked about it all made it seem a lot less stressful and traumatic than I was expecting. Some sort of good news!
            </p>
						<p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 12th September</span>
              The PET scan all went fine. They saw me about 90 minutes earlier than the appointment was booked for. I was injected with some sort of radio-active liquid and made to wait in a room on my own for about an hour. The scan was not as bad as the MRI scan and only took about 20 minutes. By 10:45, I was on my way to Gatwick.
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 17th September</span>
              While at the beach, I had a phone call from a cancer nurse in Basingstoke to tell me that my cancer has not spread to other parts of my body and that I will now be referred to Southampton for surgery. It has spread to one of my lymph nodes which will have to be removed as well but overall, this was very good news.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 19th September</span>
              I phoned the prostate cancer people in Basingstoke again today. We had both been struggling with everything since Tuesday and were considering options for flying straight home. However, I managed to get through to Precious and once again, she was very reassuring and answered all our questions. She seemed to think we should hear from Southampton in the next week and so we decided to carry on with the holiday as planned.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 24th September</span>
              I had a phone call from the hospital in Southampton offering me an appointment tomorrow as they had a cancellation. It was not possible for us to get home in time for this so I had to turn it down. This was a shame as there was nothing we could do about it but I was told that I would get my appointment date later today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I received an e-mail offering me an appointment on 23rd of October. This was not good as we were hoping to see someone sooner than that. When Roz got back from the beach, we booked a consultation privately on October 1st.
            </p>
						<p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 1st October</span>
              Roz and I drove down to Spire hospital in Southampton for a 7pm consultation with Mr Chedgy. He was very good at explaining what was going on and the severity of my cancer. He confirmed that surgery was my best option. He also told us how severe the cancer was and after discussing everything with him, we both agreed that spending £20,000 to have the operation done privately was a good move. He told us that he may be able to do the operation on 23rd Oct.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 2nd October</span>
              Had a phone call at 8:45 from Laura, Mr Chedgy's secretary. She confirmed that I can be booked in for the operation on the 23rd.
