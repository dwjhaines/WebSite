            Spent yesterday evening in Birchington on Sea with Mark and Steve watching Poland v England. We were up at 7:00 this morning and were on our way by 8:00. We had a bit of a cross-country route to get to Folkestone, a journey of about an hour and were checked in just after 9:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were booked on the 10:20 train. We were told that it was not possible to get on an earlier one but after visiting the services and buying duty-free tobacco, we went through passport control, had our passports stamped and were put on the 9:50. The crossing was as straightforward as always and by 11:30, we were driving towards Belgium. This was the first time we have crossed since Brexit but apart from being asked for proof of vaccination, getting through had been as easy as ever.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a stop in Adinkerke as soon as we crossed into Belgium. We got rid of all our empty Belgian beer bottles at XL and bought a few cases with the money we got back from them. We then drove non-stop to Aachen. It was an uneventful journey and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor just after 3:30.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
			We had  much needed showers and were out of the hotel by 4:20. First stop was the Goldenes Schwein. After all the hassle and uncertainty of preparing for this trip, it was a relief to be sat in a bar with our first wheat beers.... which went down very quickly. We went from there to Hopfen & Malz. This was a beer shop/bar that we discovered on a previous visit to Aachen last year. The shop had moved to a new location since then. The new version was quite a bit nicer than the old one and still had an excellent range of beers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After one in Hopfen & Malz, we had one more in the Domkeller, a new pub for us, and then went to Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb where we had a couple more beers with a curry wurst each. Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we had two more in Zum goldenen Einhorn before ending the night in the Aachener Brauhaus. No recollection at all of walking back to the hotel but we were in bed by 22:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th September</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at about 10:40 and drove first to the supermarket round the corner. We returned our German beer bottles and bought things for breakfast. We drove out of Aachen and briefly back into Belgium to continue our drive down to Bacharach. We stopped to eat breakfast at a picnic area although we had to eat in the car as it was raining by this time. It was another uneventful journey and we got to Bacharach just after 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We parked in a car park opposite the Bei der Post, the hotel where we are staying tonight, about 0.8 miles from the centre. The weather was still poor but we could not check in until 5pm so went out on our bikes for a few hours anyway. We cycled up the Rhineradweg to Bingen, a not too exciting town, before getting totally soaked cycling back. It was a nice enough ride of 21 miles but we could have done with the weather being better.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back in Bacharach, we checked into the hotel. We had a pretty good room with our own terrace outside where we could keep the bikes. We had showers and walked back into town. We went first to Kleines Brewhouse. This was a slightly strange place. It would have had very good views of the river but, because of the weather we were sat in an old carousel type thing with plastic sheeting all round it. We were a bit concerned about how quick the service would be when we arrived but food and drinks were good and came quickly so it was all good in the end.

        <p class="diary-text">
			After eating and sheltering from the rain for 10 minutes, we walked back to the centre and went into one of the many weinstubes in the town - Zum Grünen Baum. This is somewhere we all visited the last time we were in Bacharach in 2003. A nice place but here the service was terrible. We had almost given up and left before they finally bought our drinks but we did stay for a half liter of the local wine. We had a couple more beers in a more normal pub type place but there were not many people around and most places were closing by 9:30ish. We walked back to the hotel and had one more beer on our terrace before going to bed.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th September</span>
            We had to check out of the hotel by 10:00 this morning. We bought a 30 day parking ticket for the car (€10), left everything in it that we will not need for the next couple of days and headed off on our bikes to start a three day trip to Cologne. We stopped in the centre of Bacharach to buy breakfast and ate it in front of the hotel we had stayed in 18 years ago.

			Today we were aiming for Koblenz, about 35 miles away along the Rhineradweg. The cycling was very easy with hardly any hills. It was a very scenic route, particularly as we passed the Loreley and the towns of Sankt Goer and Boppard. As we got towards Koblenz, we recognised the Maximilians Brauwiesen on the other side of the river. This was an excellent place that we had visited on a bike ride from Limberg in about 2008. We crossed the river and stopped in there for our first beer of the day. We cycled from there to Deutsches Eck where the Moselle flows into the Rhine at Koblenz and then continued a few miles along the Moselle to our hotel - Hotel + Weinhaus Kreuter. We ended up doing just over 40 miles and arrived at the hotel just after 4pm.

        <p class="diary-text">
			The hotel was in Güls, a small suburb a bit further out of Koblenz than we were expecting, and there was not a lot in the immediate area. We walked to a supermarket to buy food for a late lunch and then returned to the hotel for showers and to follow the football.
        </p> 
		<p class="diary-text">
			One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was the restaurant on a terrace overlooking the Moselle. This was closed for some reason and it looked as if we did not have too many options for eating and drinking here. On the positive side, we were keen on watching the final of the US Open tennis tonight and we had worked out that it was on German Eurosport which we could watch in our room. We went out at about 7:00 for another look around and found a very nice wine stube next door but one to our hotel. We had a beer and a couple of glasses of wine in there while managing to buy tickets for Bayern Munich's home game next Saturday. We then walked to a petrol station a few minutes down the road and bought a couple of litres of wine, a couple of cold beers and a bag of ice before returning to the room. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			It turned into quite a good evening. We drank the beers and ate the remains of the food we had bought for lunch while waiting for the wine to cool down and joined the J-Team video call for an hour or so. We left the call at 10:00 to watch the tennis and finish the wine. A very enjoyable evening in the end!

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th September</span>
            For the first time this trip, we had breakfast included so ate before leaving the hotel. We checked out just before 11 and started the next leg of our ride. We planned to go as far as Bonn today and expected it to be just over 40 miles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The ride today was not quite as scenic as yesterday's but was still very nice in places. It was an easy ride again although it turned out to be eight or nine miles longer than expected. Part of this was due to going a longer route out of Koblenz and then an unsign-posted diversion that got everyone lost at Sinzig. We had a brief lunch stop in Remagen and arrived at the Ibis hotel in Bonn at exactly 5pm.
        </p>

			We stayed in this Ibis on the day of the World Cup Final in 2006 and had a similar evening today... apart from there being no football to watch of course. We went for a wander around the not too spectacular sights of Bonn and then went and ate in the Italian restaurant across the road from the hotel that we had eaten in 15 years ago. This time we could not get a table inside but had a table on the pavement instead. The place was very busy and initially the service was a bit slow but the food was superb. We had pizzas and a few wheat beers and were back in the hotel for an early night by 9pm.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Monday 13th September</span>
            An easier days cycling today. We had not had much to drink last night so were able to get up earlier without any hangovers. Also, it was only 23 miles to Cologne, our destination for today and the end of our trip down The Rhine.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel just after 9:00 and headed back to the river, stopping at another Rewe to buy breakfast. We stopped to eat as soon as we got to the river and then continued our journey North towards Cologne. The ride was inevitably not as scenic today as a lot of the areas we were going through were very industrial. Still an enjoyable trip, particularly the final few miles into Cologne. We managed to totally lose the radweg at one stage but were only a mile or two from it so were able to rejoin it easily enough. The whole route today was not as well signposted as some German routes and getting into Cologne was not as straightforward as it should have been but by about midday, we arrived at the very impressive cathedral in the centre. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a few photos of the cathedral, we pushed our bikes to the station and eventually managed to buy tickets for us and the bikes back to Bacharach. We got the 12:56 train which left about 10 minutes late. We ate the remains of last night's pizzas for lunch and had an enjoyable two hour journey back down along The Rhine, retracing the route that we had cycled along for the last three days.

			We got back into Bacharach just after 3pm and cycled up to find where our apartment for the next two days was located. The apartment had a place to park so we returned to our first hotel and collected the car, stopped in the centre for provisions and drove back to the apartment. We were not expecting to check in until 5 but by the time we got there at about 4:15, Roz had had a message to say that the key was in the door and we could let ourselves in. The apartment was excellent with lots of space and great views of the river.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After showering and sorting our stuff out from the last couple of days, we went and sat on our terrace. We had bought a couple of bottles of beer and a few litres of the local wine (€2.50 a litre) and spent an hour or so looking at the view while trying to sort out our Bonaire flights for next month (unsuccessfully!). At 7:30, we walked into town and went to a couple of the winestubes. We had a couple of glasses in Weingut Karl Heidrich and a couple more in Altes Haus, both very nice places with much better service than we had had in the winestube we visited a few days ago.

			We had planned to go back to the bar we went to last time for a few beers but realised that we were already quite pissed so walking the mile back to the apartment seemed a more sensible idea. We had not drank that much but had not eaten anything since the pizza so had got drunk quite quickly. Not so sensibly, we drank more of our wine when we got back. Neither of us remember going to bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th September</span>
            For the first time this trip, we were staying in the same place for two nights and did not have a lot to do. We spent the morning in the apartment sorting out washing and trying to sort out our Bonaire flights for next month (successfully this time!)
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We still went out on our bikes again. We decided that we would cycle to Boppard, a nice looking town 18 miles away that we had cycled past on Saturday. We headed off just after midday stopping to take photos in Bacharach on the way. Although we had already done this route, the weather was better today than it has been the last few days and everything looked better than it had done in with clouds and grey skies in the background. A mile after we had got past Sankt Goer, I had a puncture in my front tyre. I had a spare tube with my but no pump so after changing the tube, I had to walk back into Sankt Goer. The only repair shop was not open until 3pm but I managed to borrow a pump from another cyclist so was able to inflate the tyre.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

			src="images/germany2021/germany_008.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			As soon as I started cycling again, I realised that the tyre was not on correctly but it was still holding air so I thought it would be OK to get me back to Backarach. I returned to where I had left Roz and we continued down the river for a few more miles. We gave up on the idea of Boppard due to the amount of time I had spent sporting out my tyre and turned round at Hirzenach after eating our sandwiches for lunch. Not long after we turned round, my tyre blew again. We cycled slowly the few miles back to Sankt Goer by which time the bike shop was open. I replaced the tube for a second time and did a better job of it this time so we could have an uneventful ride back to Bacharach.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a similar evening to yesterday. We had a few drinks in the apartment and then walked into the centre. We had planned to eat in Zur Kupferkanne, the pub we had visited a few days ago. However, the old woman who seemed to run the place on her own was not doing food so we just had a drink in there and went for a pizza and a litre of wine in the pizza place just up the road from the centre. Not quite as authentic a pizza as the one in Bonn but very enjoyable nonetheless. We walked back to the apartment and had a few more drinks before going to bed slightly more sober than last night.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 15th September</span>
            We left the apartment just after 9 and started driving the 261 miles to Deggendorf. The weather was poor today. It was raining heavily for most of the first half of the journey and intermittently for the second half. Apart from this, it was an easy enough journey and we arrived at our hotel in Deggendorf (Hotel Donauhof) just after 3pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got all the stuff out of the car and then headed off on our bikes to Plattling where we bought our train ticket for tomorrow. The weather was still not great but it was an easy 15 mile round trip. We returned to the hotel for showers and then walked into the town centre about 500m away. The centre was typical of a lot of Bavarian towns with a few nice looking buildings and a few places that looked good for eating and drinking. We headed for Gasthaus Zur Knödelwerferin as I had seen on their website that they sold beer from the Weltenburg Abbey Brewery where we had been drinking almost exactly a year ago. We ate in there, had a few beers and were back in the hotel by 9:30.

            For the next part of the trip, we are trying to cycle just about all of the Isarradweg. We will leave the car at the hotel in Deggendorf and get the train to Mittenwald near to where the route starts. We will then cycle back to Deggendorf where the Isar flows into the Danube with a couple of days in Munich on the way. We will return to the same hotel to collect the car next week.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel after an excellent breakfast and cycled back to the station at Plattling. We wanted to catch the 9:02 train to Munich. We could have caught the train from Deggendorf but it left there at 8:45 and our all day Bayern ticket was not valid until 9:00. We got to the station by about 8:20 so had 40 minutes to wait for the train which left on time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived at Munich Hbf at about 10:30 and had an hour to wait for our connecting train to Mittenwald. At this point, it was tempting to abandon the planned cycle ride altogether. The weather was still cold and wet. We were planning on cycling from Mittenwald to Lenggries and there was a severe thunder storm warning in this area with a better  than 50% chance of storms all day. Once we had got to Mittenwald, we were just about committed to completing the ride which could have been very unpleasant if the weather turned bad. There were not too many public transport options between the two places.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

			src="images/germany2021/germany_010.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We decided to get on with it and got on the 11:30 train to Mittenwald where we arrived about two hours later. We had a brief ride around the town which was all very nice but we were aware that we needed to get on our way. We found the Isar radweg without any problems but as soon as we left the town, it became badly sign-posted and hard to follow. We had managed to get back onto it by Wallgau but here found that it was closed completely. There was someone there to give us an alternative route but it had all added up to make a very slow start to the journey which was not ideal as we had limited hours of daylight to get to Lenggries.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Things got better after this. The alternative route took us on a very easy path round Walchensee which was also the most scenic part of the journey. The signs also got clearer after this so we did not have to keep stopping to look at our phones at every junction. We did not do much of the journey on the Isar radweg but this did not really matter.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were also lucky with the weather. It was raining lightly as we left Mittenwald and there was a lot of low cloud. If it had got much worse the trip would have been slower and not enjoyable. As it was, it stayed dry for the whole journey. We could see the clouds getting blacker and blacker as we approached Lenggries and it was a bit of a dash to the hotel. The rain held off until about 10 seconds after we had arrived at the hotel so we could not have timed it any better.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We went out to eat at 7ish. Lenggries is a small village with not too many eating options but we found Hotel Wirtshaus "Der Altwirt" (not a sausage house apparently) which was an excellent place. The food was very good and the beer was from Schneider Weisse. We had a few beers with our meal but it was another early night. Back in the room by 9pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 17th September</span>
            We left Lenggries after breakfast in the hotel just after 9:00. The Isarradweg was badly signposted yet again for the first few miles but once we were on it, it was relatively easy to follow. We got to Bad Tölz fairly easily but after that, although the route was easy to follow, a lot of it was on unsurfaced paths and was relatively hilly. Roz was not too happy with cycling on the gravel and after falling off her bike near Wolfratshausen, we decided that we should abandon the route and head directly to Munich.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
			The route into Munich was not great as a lot of it was along the side of a main road and we had to keep stopping to check directions but by 2:30 we arrived at Paulaner am Nockherberg for our first beer of the day. We had one in the beer garden there and then carried on another half a mile to the Holiday Inn where we are booked in for two nights. After locking up the bikes in the underground car park and checking in, we had quick showers and headed into the centre of Munich.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			First stop was the Viktualienmarkt beer garden. This was still excellent but is no longer self service so not quite as good as it used to be. We had one in there and then went to Nürnberger Bratwurst Glöckl am Dom for sausages and a few more beers. We walked from there to Augustiner Stammhaus where we had a few more drinks. Things start to get a bit unclear from here. I had three litres in here and do not remember the latter stages of our visit or leaving. We went from there to Schneider Bräuhaus where we stayed for just over an hour although neither of us remember this clearly.
			We then managed to spend more than an hour walking back to the hotel despite it being less than a mile away. A good night!

            I was awake by 9:00 and went out for a walk as Roz was still asleep. Today was the first day of the Oktoberfest. Although the actual festival is not happening, it is still celebrated and a lot of people had already started drinking. Schneider Bräuhaus was already half full. I went to a couple of pharmacies to try and get our UK covid certificates converted to EU covid certificates but was told that it was not necessary. I also bought a pair of reading glasses to replace the ones that I no longer have after yesterday's session and bought breakfast which we ate in the room.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We both went out again just after 11:00. For the first time since we have been away, the weather was really nice so we headed for the Augustiner Keller beer garden. We saw horse drawn drays from two of the six main breweries as we walked into the centre. We walked as far as Marienplatz which was by now packed and decided to get the S-Bahn the rest of the way. The Augustiner is always our favourite beer garden and today the atmosphere was excellent. The Oktoberfest meant that there were a lot of Germans there in traditional costume, there was an oompah band playing and there were a lot of football fans from both Bocham and Bayern Munich. We had a couple of drinks in there before heading out to the Allianz Arena at about 2.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got to the ground about at 2:30 about an hour before kick-off. We had a few problems getting in as our UK covid certificates were initially not accepted at the turnstiles. We were sent away to what looked a very long queue to try and get something that would allow us into the ground and at this point it looked as if we would not make kick-off. However, it was sorted out fairly quickly and when we returned to the turnstiles, we were not even asked to show anything. Got to our seats about 10 minutes before the game started.

			The ground was only a third full due to covid restrictions but the atmosphere was still good. We were sat with a mixture of Bayern and Bocham fans. The game was a bit one-sided (7 - 0) but was still entertaining and it was well worth going to. We had been to the outside of the stadium before and it was just as good on the inside as well. We were a bit disappointed that they did not sell beer in the ground although this was probably for the best as a break from drinking did not do us any harm! 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the ground a few minutes before the final whistle and got straight onto a U-Bahn back to Marienplatz. By 5:45, we were back at the Schneider Bräuhaus. Due to everywhere being busier than usual and all the covid checks there were queues to get in everywhere. As we had good seats we decided to stay where we were for most of the evening. Again the atmosphere in there was excellent with another oompah band and plenty of groups of drunk people. We ate in there while getting through 12 wheat beers before heading off to The Hofbräuhaus.

			The Hofbräuhaus was fuller than we have seen it for years with no evidence of any social distancing. All the tables were back in use and all of them seemed full. It was back to the good old days of finding a space on someones table and joining them. It was good to see it back to how it used to be with plenty of people from all over the place to talk to. We had three litres in there before walking back to the hotel. Apparently we had another beer in the Schneider Bräuhaus but I have no recollection of this at all.

			Today has been an excellent day out. I don't know if it is because of the start of the Oktoberfest or just the fact that people are starting to go out and do things again without as many restrictions but there seems to have been a party atmosphere everywhere we have been. Really enjoyed all the places we have visited today.

            We checked out of the hotel at 11:30 and cycled to McDonalds for breakfast. We had booked a room in Freising for tonight as it is only about 25 miles away and we knew that having a long ride after two nights in Munich was not a good idea. We did not bother trying to find the Isarradweg to start with but had a very pleasant ride past The Hofbräuhaus and through the Englischer Garten. After about 8 miles, we rejoined the river and had an easy ride all the way into Freising.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We checked into the Mercure Hotel, and went straight out for a walk around the town. All nice enough although the amount of construction work going on did somewhat spoil it all.

			I had been looking forward to Freising as I was keen on visiting the Weihenstephan Brewery, apparently the oldest in the world. However, it is two miles from where we are staying and after the amount we had drunk in the last couple of days, neither of us could be bothered to walk to it. Instead we walked slightly out of the old town to Hofbrauhauskeller where we had very good schnitzels and a few beers before going back to the hotel by 8pm.

            Today was our longest ride of the trip. It was cold and grey looking when we woke and we did not fancy stopping en route for breakfast so walked to a cafe for something to eat before setting off. We checked out of the hotel at 8:30 and rejoined the Isarradweg almost straight away. The route was well sign-posted today and remained close to the river so was easy to follow. It was also almost totally flat again so we made better progress than usual despite the fact that the first half of the path was mainly unsurfaced.

			We had our first break at Landshut which looked a superb place and somewhere we will happily come back to visit again. From here, the path was still flat and mainly surfaced making it quicker again. We had one other stop for lunch and arrived in Landau an der Isar just after 3pm having cycled just over 57 miles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We found our way to our apartment for the night. It is not in the best of locations as it is in the new part of the town but it is cheap and better value than anything in the old town. Although the area is not great, it does have a supermarket, a couple of takeaways and an excellent bottle shop all within a few minutes walk. The apartment was also very nice so after checking in, we decided that we would eat in tonight. We walked to the supermarket and bottle shop and stocked up on provisions.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			In the evening we went and collected a large pizza from the restaurant underneath the apartments while working our way through a litre of wine, a couple of bottles of Schneider Oktoberfest beer and a six-pack of Augustiner Hell. Another enjoyable evening.

            Our final day of cycling down the Isar. Today was an easier day. After eating breakfast in the apartment we headed off just after 10. It was only about 13 miles to Plattling so we were back there by about 11:30. The Isarradweg splits in two here. One route goes to Deggendorf and the other continues along the river to Isarmündung, the Mouth of the Isar, where it joins The Danube. We had not been aware of this a week ago and had been confused as to how we had been on the path but no-where near the river. Today we decided that we would cycle on the Isarmündung route even though we would then have to cycle back to Plattling to get to Deggendorf.

			The journey to Isarmündung was a bit of an anti-climax. We were hoping to get to the end of the route and see the Isar entering The Danube, but the route wound around a nature reserve type area without going to where the rivers met. We found a viewing tower with very unspectacular views of the river. We ate the remains of yesterday's pizza there before returning to Plattling. It was an easy ride from Plattling to Deggendorf and we arrived back at Hotel Donauhof at 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We unloaded the luggage from the bikes and went straight out on our bikes again. My bike has been having problems for a lot of the journey. It is done a lot of miles since its last service and I knew some parts needed replacing. I was planning on doing this at home but it was getting to be almost un-ridable. It was just about OK for the routes we have been doing the last few days but needed repairing before attempting the hills around Aachen. There were three bike shops near the hotel. The first was closed but the second one told me that I needed to replace most of the drive train i.e. cranks, chainrings, chain and cassette. He could do the repair this afternoon for €145. Roz's bike also needed the back brake fixing so we left both bikes there and walked back to the hotel.

			After checking in, we walked back into town and went looking for the only sight we had missed last time - the statue of the dumpling thrower. We had not been aware that this was the name of the restaurant we had eaten in when we were here six days ago and did not know the story. We tried to find some sort of dumpling related souvenir but could not find anything worth buying so returned to the hotel. At 5:00 we got a message from The FahrRadShop saying that our bikes were ready to collect. We walked back to the shop and paid €175 in total for the repairs before riding the bikes back to the hotel. Everything seemed back to normal with my bike and Roz's bike was fine again having had the brake cable and blocks replaced.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Gasthaus Zur Knödelwerferin (The Dumpling Thrower) to eat. We had a few wheat beers and I did try one of the homemade dumpling dishes. Back in the hotel by 10.

            A 400 mile drive back to Aachen today. We knew we were staying in Lille on Saturday but had three days before then where we were not really sure what we doing. After looking at all the options we decided that the Ibis in Aachen was very good value and three days there was as good a bet as anything else. It meant that a lot of the driving was out of the way and the weather was better in that area than it was in Bavaria.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel at about 8:25. Once again, it was an uneventful journey. We had two brief stops, one for toilets and one for petrol. We ate while we drove. The traffic was bad around Frankfurt and Cologne and there were plenty of roadworks but we still got to the hotel in Aachen just after 4pm which was not too bad, all things considered.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We put our stuff in the room and went straight out on our bikes. We were keen on visiting Cafe t' Vereinshoes in Vaals just the other side of the Dutch border. From where we are staying this is only about three miles away. We did a few extra miles before getting to the bar making it a round trip of 10 miles in total. We had a few Le Trappe beers and a portion of Dutch snacks before cycling back to Aachen.

			After showers, we went out again. We had one in Hopfen & Malz and then went to Domkeller, the pub we had found a couple of weeks ago. This place was excellent again and we ended up spending the whole evening in there getting through 12 wheat beers. We had planned to go and eat but ended up making do with a bowl of nachos and a couple of portions of anchovies!

            We had breakfast in the room and then went out for a walk around Aachen. We walked through the centre and out to the Ponttor, a large medieval gate on the opposite side of town to where we are staying. We walked back to the hotel via the Rathaus and the cathedral. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We went out on our bikes again at about 1:30. We had two things that we wanted to do. We needed to buy a green sticker for the car so that we can legally enter German cities. We were unaware that we needed one last year but should have had one when we entered Aachen. We also wanted to go on a bike ride that involved having a beer in three different countries. We have attempted this a couple of times in the past but for a number of reasons had failed to complete the challenge.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The first of these involved going to the TÜV office a couple of miles away. When someone eventually turned up at the counter, it took about a minute and €7 to get given the sticker. We cycled back through Aachen and out towards Vaals. Before getting to Vaals, we turned up the hill towards Drielandenpunt, the point where the borders of Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany all meet. It is also the highest point in The Netherlands. Although not particularly high, it was still hard work getting up to it and would certainly not have been possible if my bike had not been repaired.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a few photos we had the first of our beers about 10m across the Belgian border. Le Bistro was closed but there was a stall outside that sold Leffe. We had a couple of bottles and a portion of chips.

			We had planned to cycle a bit further into Belgium but missed a turning somewhere and ended up heading straight down the hill into Vaals. Not the end of the world! We had a couple of Le Trappe beers again at Cafe t' Vereinshoes with a portion of their mini snacks and then cycled back into Aachen.

			For our German beer, we returned to Kölnthor which had been our local bar when we stayed in that part of Aachen. A couple of wheat beers in there and we had managed to do the three countries. We think this may be the first time we have had a drink in three different countries on the same day!

			Having completed this achievement, we returned to the hotel for showers and went out for the evening. We went to a few different bars this time including a couple of new ones. We stopped for a drink at the Goldenes Schwein and then another at Poststübchen, a small pub that we had not been into before. We had one in the small bar at the Aachener Brauhaus and then went to the Ratskeller. This was an excellent place that we have walked past many times but never visited. We finished off the evening with a few at the Domkeller again.

            We had planned to go to Liege for the day today but discovered that although it is only 23 minutes away by train, return tickets for the two of us would cost over €80 for some reason. We knocked that idea on the head and decided to stay in and around Aachen instead.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Did not do a lot all morning apart from a trip to the supermarket to buy breakfast and we both did our lateral flow tests so that we are allowed to go home on Sunday. We had looked at a few alternatives to the Liege trip and in the end decided to visit the Brand Brewery, About 10 miles away in The Netherlands. It was a very easy ride there as it was just about all downhill. The brewery was a very nice place to visit. We did not know if we would be able to just have a drink there or if we would have to do a tour but we were able to just sit and drink in their bar area. We both tried a couple of the Brand beers and also bought our first souvenirs of the trip - a t-shirt and a "keg cushion". We were back in Aachen just after 6pm.

			After showers, we walked straight to Zum goldenen Einhorn. We had not eaten since breakfast and were both hungry. We had excellent schnitzels again in there and stayed for a few hours. Being a Friday night, everywhere was busy and we were quite happy sat in our usual table. We were going to stop for one in the Aachener Brauhaus but it was totally packed with no-where to sit. We went instead to the pub we were in last night, Poststübchen, and ended up staying for three rounds. Got back to the hotel just before midnight slightly more sober than we had been the previous two nights.
