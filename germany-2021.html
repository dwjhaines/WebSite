            Spent yesterday evening in Birchington on Sea with Mark and Steve watching Poland v England. We were up at 7:00 this morning and were on our way by 8:00. We had a bit of a cross-country route to get to Folkestone, a journey of about an hour and were checked in just after 9:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were booked on the 10:20 train. We were told that it was not possible to get on an earlier one but after visiting the services and buying duty-free tobacco, we went through passport control, had our passports stamped and were put on the 9:50. The crossing was as straightforward as always and by 11:30, we were driving towards Belgium. Apart from being asked for proof of vaccination, getting through had been as easy as ever.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a stop in Adinkerke as soon as we crossed into Belgium. We got rid of all our empty beer bottles at XL and bought a few cases with the money we got back from them. We then drove non-stop to Aachen. It was an uneventful journey and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor just after 3:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We had  much needed showers and were out of the hotel by 4:20. First stop was the Goldenes Schwein. After all the hassle and uncertainty of preparing for this trip, it was a relief to be sat in a bar with our first wheat beers. We had one in there before moving on to Hopfen & Malz. This was a beer shop/bar that we discovered on a previous visit to Aachen last year. The shop had moved to a new location since then. The new version was quite a bit nicer than the old one and still had an excellent range of beers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After one in there, we had one more in the Domkeller, a new pub for us, and then went to Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb where we had a couple more beers with a curry wurst each. Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we had two more in Zum goldenen Einhorn before ending the night in the Aachener Brauhaus. No recollection at all of walking back to the hotel but we were in bed by 22:00.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th September</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at about 10:40 and drove first to the supermarket round the corner. We returned our German beer bottles and bought things for breakfast. We drove out of Aachen and briefly back into Belgium to continue our drive down to Bacharach. We stopped to eat breakfast at a picnic area although we had to eat in the car as it was raining by this time. It was another uneventful journey and we got to Bacharach just after 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We parked in a car park opposite the Bei der Post, the hotel where we are staying tonight. The weather was still poor but we could not check in until 5pm so went out on our bikes for a few hours anyway. We cycled along the Rhine to Bingen, a not too exciting town, before getting totally soaked cycling back.
