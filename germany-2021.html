            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 9th September</span>
            Spent yesterday evening in Birchington on Sea with Mark and Steve watching Poland v England. We were up at 7:00 this morning and were on our way by 8:00. We had a bit of a cross-country route to get to Folkestone, a journey of about an hour and were checked in just after 9:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were booked on the 10:20 train. We were told that it was not possible to get on an earlier one but after visiting the services and buying duty-free tobacco, we went through passport control, had our passports stamped and were put on the 9:50. The crossing was as straightforward as always and by 11:30, we were driving towards Belgium. Apart from being asked for proof of vaccination, getting through had been as easy as ever.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a stop in Adinkerke as soon as we crossed into Belgium. We got rid of all our empty Belgian beer bottles at XL and bought a few cases with the money we got back from them. We then drove non-stop to Aachen. It was an uneventful journey and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor just after 3:30.
        </p>

			We had  much needed showers and were out of the hotel by 4:20. First stop was the Goldenes Schwein. After all the hassle and uncertainty of preparing for this trip, it was a relief to be sat in a bar with our first wheat beers.... which went down very quickly. We went from there to Hopfen & Malz. This was a beer shop/bar that we discovered on a previous visit to Aachen last year. The shop had moved to a new location since then. The new version was quite a bit nicer than the old one and still had an excellent range of beers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After one in Hopfen & Malz, we had one more in the Domkeller, a new pub for us, and then went to Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb where we had a couple more beers with a curry wurst each. Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we had two more in Zum goldenen Einhorn before ending the night in the Aachener Brauhaus. No recollection at all of walking back to the hotel but we were in bed by 22:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th September</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at about 10:40 and drove first to the supermarket round the corner. We returned our German beer bottles and bought things for breakfast. We drove out of Aachen and briefly back into Belgium to continue our drive down to Bacharach. We stopped to eat breakfast at a picnic area although we had to eat in the car as it was raining by this time. It was another uneventful journey and we got to Bacharach just after 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We parked in a car park opposite the Bei der Post, the hotel where we are staying tonight, about 0.8 miles from the centre. The weather was still poor but we could not check in until 5pm so went out on our bikes for a few hours anyway. We cycled up the Rhineradweg to Bingen, a not too exciting town, before getting totally soaked cycling back. It was a nice enough ride of 21 miles but we could have done with the weather being better.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back in Bacharach, we checked into the hotel. We had a pretty good room with our own terrace outside where we could keep the bikes. We had showers and walked back into town. We went first to Kleines Brewhouse. This was a slightly strange place. It would have had very good views of the river but, because of the weather we were sat in an old carousel type thing with plastic sheeting all round it. We were a bit concerned about how quick the service would be when we arrived but food and drinks were good and came quickly so it was all good in the end.

        <p class="diary-text">
			After eating and sheltering from the rain for 10 minutes, we walked back to the centre and went into one of the many weinstubes in the town - Zum Grünen Baum. This is somewhere we all visited the last time we were in Bacharach in 2003. A nice place but here the service was terrible. We had almost given up and left before they finally bought our drinks but we did stay for a half liter of the local wine. We had a couple more beers in a more normal pub type place but there were not many people around and most places were closing by 9:30ish. We walked back to the hotel and had one more beer on our terrace before going to bed.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th September</span>
            We had to check out of the hotel by 10:00 this morning. We bought a 30 day parking ticket for the car (€10), left everything in it that we will not need for the next couple of days and headed off on our bikes to start a three day trip to Cologne. We stopped in the centre of Bacharach to buy breakfast and ate it in front of the hotel we had stayed in 18 years ago.

			Today we were aiming for Koblenz, about 35 miles away along the Rhineradweg. The cycling was very easy with hardly any hills. It was a very scenic route, particularly as we passed the Loreley and the towns of Sankt Goer and Boppard. As we got towards Koblenz, we recognised the Maximilians Brauwiesen on the other side of the river. This was an excellent place that we had visited on a bike ride from Limberg in about 2008. We crossed the river and stopped in there for our first beer of the day. We cycled from there to Deutsches Eck where the Moselle flows into the Rhine at Koblenz and then continued a few miles along the Moselle to our hotel - Hotel + Weinhaus Kreuter. We ended up doing just over 40 miles and arrived at the hotel just after 4pm.

        <p class="diary-text">
			The hotel was in Güls, a small suburb a bit further out of Koblenz than we were expecting, and there was not a lot in the immediate area. We walked to a supermarket to buy food for a late lunch and then returned to the hotel for showers and to follow the football.
        </p> 
		<p class="diary-text">
			One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was the restaurant on a terrace overlooking the Moselle. This was closed for some reason and it looked as if we did not have too many options for eating and drinking here. On the positive side, we were keen on watching the final of the US Open tennis tonight and we had worked out that it was on German Eurosport which we could watch in our room. We went out at about 7:00 for another look around and found a very nice wine stube next door but one to our hotel. We had a beer and a couple of glasses of wine in there while managing to buy tickets for Bayern Munich's home game next Saturday. We then walked to a petrol station a few minutes down the road and bought a couple of litres of wine, a couple of cold beers and a bag of ice before returning to the room. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			It turned into quite a good evening. We drank the beers and ate the remains of the food we had bought for lunch while waiting for the wine to cool down and joined the J-Team video call for an hour or so. We left the call at 10:00 to watch the tennis and finish the wine. A very enjoyable evening in the end!

            For the first time this trip, we had breakfast included so ate before leaving the hotel. We checked out just before 11 and started the next leg of our ride. We planned to go as far as Bonn today and expected it to be just over 40 miles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The ride today was not quite as scenic as yesterday's but was still very nice in places. It was an easy ride again although it turned out to be eight or nine miles longer than expected. Part of this was due to going a longer route out of Koblenz and then an unsign-posted diversion that got everyone lost at Sinzig. We had a brief lunch stop in Remagen and arrived at the Ibis hotel in Bonn at exactly 5pm.
        </p>

			We stayed in this Ibis on the day of the World Cup Final in 2006 and had a similar evening today... apart from there being no football to watch of course. We went for a wander around the not too spectacular sights of Bonn and then went and ate in the Italian restaurant across the road from the hotel that we had eaten in 15 years ago. This time we could not get a table inside but had a table on the pavement instead. The place was very busy and initially the service was a bit slow but the food was superb. We had pizzas and a few wheat beers and were back in the hotel for an early night by 9pm.

            <span class="diary-date">Monday 13th September</span>
            An easier days cycling today. We had not had much to drink last night so were able to get up earlier without any hangovers. Also, it was only 23 miles to Cologne, our destination for today and the end of our trip down The Rhine.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel just after 9:00 and headed back to the river, stopping at another Rewe to buy breakfast. We stopped to eat as soon as we got to the river and then continued our journey North towards Cologne. The ride was inevitably not as scenic today as a lot of the areas we were going through were very industrial. Still an enjoyable trip, particularly the final few miles into Cologne. We managed to totally lose the radweg at one stage but were only a mile or two from it so were able to rejoin it easily enough. The whole route today was not as well signposted and getting into Cologne was not as straightforward as it should have been but by about midday, we arrived at the very impressive cathedral in the centre. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a few photos of the cathedral, we pushed our bikes to the station and eventually managed to buy tickets for us and the bikes back to Bacharach. We got the 12:56 train which left about 10 minutes late. We ate the remains of last night's pizzas for lunch and had an enjoyable two hour journey back down along The Rhine, retracing the route that we had cycled along for the last three days.

			We got back into Bacharach just after 3pm and cycled up to find where our apartment for the next two days was located. The apartment had a place to park so we returned to our first hotel and collected the car, stopped in the centre for provisions and drove back to the apartment. We were not expecting to check in until 5 but by the time we got there at about 4:15, Roz had had a message to say that the key was in the door and we could let ourselves in. The apartment was excellent with lots of space and great views of the river.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After showering and sorting our stuff out from the last couple of days, we went and sat on our terrace. We had bought a couple of bottles of beer and a few litres of the local wine (€2.50 a litre) and spent an hour or so looking at the view while trying to sort out our Bonaire flights for next month (unsuccessfully!). At 7:30, we walked into town and went to a couple of the winestubes. We had a couple of glasses in Weingut Karl Heidrich and a couple more in Altes Haus, both very nice places with much better service than we had had in the winestube we visited a few days ago.

			We had planned to go back to the bar we went to last time for a few beers but realised that we were already quite pissed so walking the mile back to the apartment seemed a more sensible idea. Not so sensibly, we drank more of our wine when we got back. Neither of us remember going to bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th September</span>
            For the first time this trip, we were staying in the same place for two nights and did not have a lot to do. We spent the morning in the apartment sorting out washing and trying to sort out our Bonaire flights for next month (successfully this time!)
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We still went out on our bikes again. We decided that we would cycle to Boppard, a nice looking town 18 miles away that we had cycled past on Saturday. We headed off just after midday stopping to take photos in Bacharach on the way. Although we had already done this route, the weather was better today than it has been the last few days and everything looked better than it had done in with clouds and gray skies in the background. A mile after we had got past Sankt Goer, I had a puncture in my front tyre. I had a spare tube with my but no pump so after changing the tube, I had to walk back into Sankt Goer. The only repair shop was not open until 3pm but I managed to borrow a pump from another cyclist so was able to inflate the tyre.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

			src="images/germany2021/germany_008.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="diary-text">
			As soon as I started cycling again, I realised that the tyre was not on correctly but it was still holding air so I thought it would be OK to get me back to Backarach. I returned to where I had left Roz and we continued down the river for a few more miles. We gave up on the idea of Boppard due to the amount of time I had spent sporting out my tyre and turned round at Hirzenach after eating our sandwiches for lunch. Not long after we turned round, my tyre blew again. We cycled slowly the few miles back to Sankt Goer by which time the bike shop was open. I replaced the tube for a second time and did a better job of it this time so we could have an uneventful ride back to Bacharach.
