            Due to covid-19, our planned trip to Bonaire had become a trip to Germany. As with our trip last month, it was a 4am start and we left Kingsclere just before 4:30. It was another easy drive down to Folkestone and after filling up with petrol, we were at the Euro Tunnel terminal by about 6:25. There was only one train an hour going today so we were not able to get on an earlier train than the 7:50 which we had booked. The train left on time and we were in France by about 9:30.

			We stopped off at the Beer Shop Noel Cuvelier again to get rid of a few empties and buy another seven crates of Belgium beer. We also stopped at a tobacco shop just over the border, before continuing our drive through France, Belgium and Luxembourg to Saarbrücken, just over the German border. We arrived in Saarbrücken at about 4pm, having driven about 460 miles, and found our hotel (Ibis Budget) without any problems. We were both worn out by this time but we checked in, had quick showers and went straight out to have a look around the town.

			We had a walk of about a mile into the centre and stopped for our first beer just before we got to the main part of the town. The place we stopped at (Hilde & Heinz)  had a couple of the local specialties on their menu (Dibbelabbes and Merguez) so we ordered food and had another couple of beers. After eating, we went to look at the two main sights of Saarbrücken - the Johanneskirche and the Rathaus. We had a beer in the Ratskeller and then walked into the main part of the town. We did not have high expectations of the bars of Saarbrücken but the centre was quite lively and we found a couple of decent places to drink, both being most notable for their glasses..... which we inevitably ended up taking away with us as souvenirs! We had one more in a bar half way back to the hotel and were in bed sometime around 11.
