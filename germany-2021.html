            Spent yesterday evening in Birchington on Sea with Mark and Steve watching Poland v England. We were up at 7:00 this morning and were on our way by 8:00. We had a bit of a cross-country route to get to Folkestone, a journey of about an hour and were checked in just after 9:00.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were booked on the 10:20 train. We were told that it was not possible to get on an earlier one but after visiting the services and buying duty-free tobacco, we went through passport control, had our passports stamped and were put on the 9:50. The crossing was as straightforward as always and by 11:30, we were driving towards Belgium. Apart from being asked for proof of vaccination, getting through had been as easy as ever.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a stop in Adinkerke as soon as we crossed into Belgium. We got rid of all our empty beer bottles at XL and bought a few cases with the money we got back from them. We then drove non-stop to Aachen. It was an uneventful journey and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor just after 3:30.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
			We had  much needed showers and were out of the hotel by 4:20. First stop was the Goldenes Schwein. After all the hassle and uncertainty of preparing for this trip, it was a relief to be sat in a bar with our first wheat beers. We had one in there before moving on to Hopfen & Malz. This was a beer shop/bar that we discovered on a previous visit to Aachen last year. The shop had moved to a new location since then. The new version was quite a bit nicer than the old one and still had an excellent range of beers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After one in there, we had one more in the Domkeller, a new pub for us, and then went to Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb where we had a couple more beers with a curry wurst each. Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we had two more in Zum goldenen Einhorn before ending the night in the Aachener Brauhaus. No recollection at all of walking back to the hotel but we were in bed by 22:00.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th September</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at about 10:40 and drove first to the supermarket round the corner. We returned our German beer bottles and bought things for breakfast. We drove out of Aachen and briefly back into Belgium to continue our drive down to Bacharach. We stopped to eat breakfast at a picnic area although we had to eat in the car as it was raining by this time. It was another uneventful journey and we got to Bacharach just after 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We parked in a car park opposite the Bei der Post, the hotel where we are staying tonight, about 0.8 miles from the centre. The weather was still poor but we could not check in until 5pm so went out on our bikes for a few hours anyway. We cycled up the Rhineradweg to Bingen, a not too exciting town, before getting totally soaked cycling back. It was a nice enough ride of 21 miles but we could have done with the weather being better.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back in Bacharach, we checked into the hotel. We had a pretty good room with our own terrace outside where we could keep the bikes. We had showers and walked back into town. We went first to Kleines Brewhouse. This was a slightly strange place. It would have had very good views of the river but, because of the weather we were sat in an old carousel type thing with plastic sheeting all round it. We were a bit concerned about how quick the service would be when we arrived but food and drinks were good and came quickly so it was all good in the end.

        <p class="diary-text">
			After eating and sheltering form the rain for 10 minutes, we walked back to the centre and went into one of the many weinstubes in the town - Zum Grünen Baum. This is somewhere we all visited the last time we were in Bacharach in 2003. A nice place but here the service was terrible. We had almost given up and left before they finally bought our drinks but we did stay for a half litre of the local wine. We had a couple more beers in a more normal pub type place but there were not many people around and most places were closing by 9:30ish. We walked back to the hotel and had one more beer on our terrace before going to bed.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th September</span>
            We had to check out of the hotel by 10:00 this morning. We bought a 30 day parking ticket for the car (€10), left everything in it that we will not need for the next couple of days and headed off on our bikes to start a three day trip to Cologne. We stopped in the centre to buy things for breakfast and ate in front of the hotel we had stayed in 18 years ago.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Today we were aiming for Koblenz, about 35 miles away along the Rhineradweg. The cycling was very easy with hardly any hills. It was a very scenic route, particularly as we passed the Loreley and the towns of Sankt Goer and Boppard. As we got towards Koblenz, we recognised a brewery (Maximilians Brauwiesen) we had visited on a previous trip to Limberg so we crossed the river and stopped in there for our first beer of the day. We cycled from there to Deutsches Eck where the Mozelle flows into the Rhine at Koblenz and then continued a few miles along the Mozelle to our hotel - Hotel + Weinhaus Kreuter. We ended up doing just over 40 miles and arrived at the hotel just after 4pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The hotel was in a small suburb, a bit further out of Koblenz than we were expecting and there was not a lot in the immediate area. We walked into the centre of the suburb to buy food for a late lunch and then returned to the hotel for showers and to follow the football.
