            Left Ammanford at 3:30 and drove to Dinas Powys where we picked up Gareth and then proceeded to the Severn Bridge Services. Elfan turned up with Jacqueline and Alun and there was a lot of confusion when we told him we had to pick up Chris as well. Gareth spent the journey talking to Alun about The Beano and playing with Lego.

            We arrived at Victoria Station at about 8:45 and met Olwyn, Nick and Aleks. After buying tickets and having a pint, we caught the 9:53 train to Dover Priory. We arrived in Dover at 12:10 and went by bus to the docks. We all went through the terminal collecting boarding passes on the way. Ga got a pass for the wrong boat and had to go and change it. We boarded the boat and left Dover at 1:00 am. We spent most of the journey gambling at fruit machines and the blackjack table. I won £1.50, Ga lost £2 and Chris finished about even.

            We arrived in Calais at about 3:30 and then had an hour and a half wait for a bus connection to the town. When we reached town, we got on the train to Paris which left about an hour later at 6:16. I was distressed because we didn't get our tickets stamped. We got to Paris at about 9:15 and went to a cafe where we were charged about £8 for five coffees and a few croissants.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We then went by metro to Paris Austerlitz where we were due to leave from later. We then embarked on a round Paris sight-seeing trip starting off at Notre Dame and then heading for the Eiffel Tower. We stopped en route to buy French loaves and cheese which we ate on the way. We arrived at the Eiffel Tower at 2pm and at 2:15, Beth arrived with her friend plus friend's mum. We all went up to the second stage (except Nick and Olwyn) and then lost Beth and party because they went to the top. We continued our tour along the Champs-Élysées. Me, Ga and Aleks went up to the top of the Arc de Triumph from where the view was as good as from the Eiffel Tower.

            We got the metro back to The Latin Quarter where we eventually found an Italian restaurant which was quite reasonable. We were all glad to sit down after a very tiring day. I had pate, pizza and mousse + half a pint of Carlsberg + half a carafe of wine. We left the restaurant and returned to the station where we retrieved our rucksacks and proceeded to get thrown out of two bars in the space of about five minutes (through no fault of our own). We boarded the train to Toulouse at 9:55 and it pulled out of the station on time at 10:56

            Woke up at about 7 and woke Ga and Aleks. The train arrived in Toulouse at 7:03 and we then caught a train to Agde which got in at about 9. We then got taxis to the campsite where Cathy and Linda were staying. We found their caravan and broke in due to lack of key. After dumping our rucksacks and changing, we went to the beach which is only about 100 yards away. Spent the rest of the morning swimming and sun-bathing.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We had French bread, Brie & bottles of lager for lunch. The whole lot only cost about £1. We stayed on the beach until about 3 and then showered and changed for the evening. We bought cheese, bread and lager again for tea and then me and Chris went to watch a wet t-shirt competition. We then went back to the caravan and played cards and drank lager until Cathy and Linda returned and then went to a local bar where we had a couple of pints and everyone had beefburgers.

            When we got back to the caravan we started drinking vodka which was a bad move as I don't remember anything after that. Apparently we all went to a disco before I was carried back to the caravan. Me, Nick, Ga and Chris all slept in an empty caravan next to Cathy and Linda's.

            <span class="diary-date">Monday August 19th</span>
            Woke up at about 9 with slight hangover and slight sunburn. Had croissants for breakfast and then after washing and shaving, Ga and me went for a quick swim. We hung about by the caravan for a bit and then went and hired pedalos for an hour. By this time my hangover had got worse and the heat wasn't helping. We had lunch of bread and Brie again (3rd meal in a row) and generally lazed about. Swansea lost 1 - 0 to Wigan on Saturday - it looks like they could struggle again. I went for a lie down after lunch due to hangover.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After recovering, we played cards and went swimming and then showered, etc. We went out to a pizzeria for tea and all had cheese and ham pizzas. I had about twice as much as everyone else as they couldn't finish theirs! We went back from there to the caravan where we drank lager until about 8:30. We then went to the bar to watch a cabaret act put on by the couriers (it was abysmal). While we were there, Cathy kept us supplied with drinks which were smuggled in and hidden under the table.

            At midnight the DJ played a request for Aleks as it was her 21st birthday. We danced to the record and then went and threw her in the sea. We all ended up going swimming and when we came out of the sea discovered that Aleks had lost her bra! After a lot of looking we gave up and went back to the caravan where we finished off the wine and some of the vodka. Everyone staggered off to bed at about 2:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday August 20th</span>
            We got up at 7 as Cathy and Linda had to be out of the caravan by 9. We took our rucksacks to reception and left them with the couriers to look after - they treat us as if we are paying guests. We tidied up the caravan and killed time until about 10 when we went on a coach trip to Aqualand which is a huge complex of swimming pools and long windy water chutes. Some of the slides were quite frightening from the top but once you had started on them they were great fun.. Me and Chris shared a water melon for lunch. We stayed at Aqualand until about 4 and then returned to the campsite and collected our rucksacks. We said goodbye to Cathy and Linda and then caught taxis into Agde.

            Olwyn looked after our bags at the station while we went shopping (we bought bread, pate and tuna) and then returned to the station to catch the 5:56 train to Avignon. My ears had got sunburnt ( as well as my back and arms). Olwyn disappeared just as we were getting ready to catch the train but she arrived back with about a minute to go. We arrived in Avignon at 7:21 and had abotu an hour to kill before our next train. We walked from the station to a bar and me, Ga and Aleks left our rucksacks with Chris, Nick and Olwyn while we went sight-seeing for twenty minutes. We walked about half a mile up the road and came to a large square with a merry-go-round in the middle of it. We all had a go which cost 6Fr. When it finished, we all asked a woman to take photos of us while we sat on the horses. Ga was explaining to the woman how to use his camera when the merry-go-round started up again. The woman with the cameras was confused already but at this point she gave up and left. Me and Aleks had to jump off as a bloke came round asking for tickets.

            When we had recovered from this ordeal, we returned to the bar for a half and then went to the station to catch the 8:36 to Strasbourg. We arrived in Lyon at 10:56 and discovered that there was over an hour before the train left again. Me, Ga and Aleks walked into the town centre of Lyon and had hamburgers in McDonalds. When we arrived back at the station we couldn't find the others and at one point were quite worried that the train might have gone or something. We eventually found them and re-boarded the train for a seven hour train journey to Strasbourg. (Linda found Aleks' bra on the beach this morning)

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday August 21st</span>
            We arrived in Strasbourg at about 8 and spent an hour sorting out lockers, phoning youth hostels, etc. We then went sight-seeing. Me, Chris, Ga and Aleks went off and arranged to meet Nick and Olwyn back at the station at 3. We walked around the town for a bit and then went out to the University area looking for somewhere cheap to eat. Ga bought a bunch of bananas. We walked through some botanical gardens where Ga ate some berries from a tree. We walked to the cathedral stopping for chocolate croissants and hot chocolate. The cathedral was quite solid especially the astronomical clock

            We met Nick and Olwyn at the post office and we all climbed to the top of the cathedral. Chris went off for lunch with Nick and Olwyn while me, Ga and Aleks went into the cathedral and then went to buy postcards and read papers. England won the 5th test but Swansea lost 2 - 1 at Cardiff. We went into Marks and Spencer and bought ham and hula hoops for lunch which we at in a park under a tree. Ga climbed up the tree.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We returned to the station  to meet the others and caught the 3:15 to Mannheim. We spent the train journey avoiding the guard so as not to pay a supplement. Ga and Aleks got caught. When we got to Mannheim, we walked to a youth hostel where I had to pay £15 to join and for two nights B & B. I was not overjoyed to say the least. Me, Nick and  Ga were sharing a room with two foreign blokes. Me and Ga went for a run around the park and then came back for a shower. We discovered that the two foreign blokes were British, one from  Cardiff and one had done English at Swansea University (At Mannheim station, we found a brochure of Swansea Uni showing pictures of Clyne and the warden's dog).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening, we walked around the town and went to McDonalds for tea (except for Aleks who stayed in for an early night). I only had a cheeseburger due to no money. We walked back though the town and then went back to the hostel. We left Olwyn there and went back into town and found a bar that was relatively cheap. We had a couple of pints each and returned to the hostel by 11:15.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday August 22nd</span>
            Woke up at 7:15 and went to breakfast which consisted of bread and jam and cup of tea. After washing and tidying up our room, we went into town and caught the 9:22 to Heidelberg. We arrived in Heidelberg at 9:34 and set off to go sight-seeing. On the way Ga tried to hurdle a barrier but caught his foot and fell over - dead funny. We walked about half a mile to the university and went to the student's prison which was quite interesting.

            We walked from there to the castle and saw the biggest wine barrel in the world - 220,000 litres. After we left the castle, we walked down the hill and everyone bought food except me and Ga and we all went and sat by the river for lunch. After lunch, we walked up a mountain to Philosopher's Point and then further up to an amphitheater and a church. We had a pint each while we were up there and then me and Chris had a race down the mountain against Nick and Ga. The idea was to get to the bottom of the hill, change money and get to the main square. Me and Chris won easily but Nick and Ga refused to buy the pints which had been bet at the start.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We sat around a fountain for about an hour. Ga bought a Big Mac, Chris and I bought pints from a supermarket for about 20p. We had to ask someone for a bottle opener and we got talking to two English hitch-hikers and a group of pissed Germans. We left when one of the Germans started saying what good boxers the English were. Aleks got stung by a wasp in a bread shop. We caught a train back to Mannheim and returned to the youth hostel. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Chris and I went for a run then after showering we went into town, predictably to a McDonalds. I had a Big Mac. We then went to the bar we had been in the night before and all had a pint except Ga who had two. Olwyn and Aleks met us at the bar and we all walked back to the hostel by 10:30. we had two Finns sleeping in our room so we sat outside and talked until 11:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday August 23rd</span>
            Woke at 7 and had breakfast of bread and jam again. We left the hostel at about 9 and walked to the station (Ga hurdled a gate and broke his rucksack) where we killed time for an hour writing postcards, etc. We caught the 10:22 to Heidelberg and then go the 10:48 to Munich. Arrived in Munich at about 2:30 and then spent an hour sorting out lockers, etc. Aleks' shampoo had emptied into her rucksack.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We caught the tube to Marienplatz, the main shopping centre and I bought ham and rolls. We took our food and sat in a beer  garden where we ate and drank steins. There was a lot of confusion over the next days plans so we spent about an hour discussing what we were all going to do. We decided to walk to the university having a quick look at buildings, etc en route. We got to a beer garden where we all had steins except Olwyn. We stayed for about two hours and me and Ga had three steins each. Neither of us remember leaving the beer garden.

            During the course of the evening, we had a vote and decided that we should go to Istanbul on the way to Greece (two 21 hour journeys, silly idea). We went to sleep in the station, Ga sleeping in a different place to everyone else for some unknown reason. Munich seems to be quite a solid place, we missed most of it last year.

            We were woken at about 6 by a guard and spent about an hour finding Ga and putting our stuff in lockers, etc. Me, Ga and Aleks wanted to see the Olympic stadium so we went there while the others went to see a concentration camp. We went to the stadium by tube and walked around inside the ground. We spent about an hour in the Olympic pool and then returned to town.

            We still have not paid for any tube tickets but so far have been lucky. We bought lunch in a supermarket/restaurant place. Me and Ga shared fishcake and chips while Aleks had fried squid. We went back to the station to get money and then Aleks went off to buy a toilet bag while Ga and I looked round the shops. I bought bananas to eat in Austria. We met Aleks again at 2:30 by which time I had eaten my bananas. We walked around a market for about half an hour and Aleks bought a cucumber. We then walked back to the station where we met the others and caught the 4:15 to Innsbruck. We went along a scenic route with mountains all over the place. Everyone slept most of the way.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We arrived in Innsbruck at 6:30 and went to a McDonalds for tea. After eating, we got a bus to a campsite but ended up staying in a youth hostel next door instead. It was much better than the one in Mannheim but cost about £4 a night. After showering we loafed about the hostel until about 10:30 and then went to bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday August 25th</span>
            Woke at 7 and went down for breakfast, hot chocolate, rolls, jam, etc. I spent an hour and a half writing postcards and diary while everyone else slept. We left the hostel at about 10 and walked to the station, Aleks getting stung again on the way. The weather was not so good so we didn't want to spend the day in Innsbruck. Eventually we got on a train to Seefeld which is a small town up in the Alps. The train took about 40 minutes and we saw the beast scenery we have seen so far. Seefeld was quite a nice place. We had lunch at about 12 - me and Ga had a hot dog each - and then played cricket in a small green. At 2:19 we caught the train back to Innsbruck.

            On the way back, Nick, Chris, Aleks and Olwyn planned a route going through Verona and Venice staying a night in Verona. I worked out that I could be in Athens in two days and I was very tempted to go. Got back to the station at about 3 and tried working out timetables, etc. Eventually we got on the 16:01 to Verona - a five hour journey. We arrived in Verona at about 9 and walked into the town centre for food. Ga, Chris, Nick and Olwyn all had pizzas at a restaurant while me and Aleks sat by an amphitheater type place and shared half her cucumber with a nectarine between us for afters.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked back to the station and met the others and then, after days of arguing over where we were going, the inevitable happened and we split up. Chris had told me that he would quite happily have gone to Athens with me earlier so we decided to make a move and get to Corfu as quick as possible. Ga, Nick, Aleks and Olwyn left the station at about 11:30 to look for a campsite. I was glad to see the back of Olwyn who was getting on everybody's nerves. It is a sham we have all had to split up but we are meeting up again on the campsite in just over a week. Me and Chris waited at the station for three and a half hours and then caught the 2:59 train to Trieste. We managed to find an empty compartment with fold down seats and we went to sleep at about 3:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday August 26th</span>
            We were woken at 5 by cleaners and told to change trains. Everybody else on the train had already changed. We moved across the platform to a train which was going to Trieste and got on it about five minutes before it pulled out. The train arrived in Trieste at 9:35 and we were supposed to catch the 9:42 to Belgrade. We thought we had to reserve seats for this but when we tried, we found there was no need. We eventually found the train at the wrong platform and it pulled out an hour and a half late.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We bought ham rolls, which were eaten straight away and beer and wine at the station. We spent most of the journey sleeping or playing cards. The train was incredibly empty. We had a whole compartment to ourselves which was a big difference to last years Venice - Belgrade run. We arrived in Belgrade about an hour late at midnight and managed to find the Athens train. This train was packed as expected. We got off the train to get something to eat before it left and bought a load of bread rolls. Luckily we both went because the train had gone by the time we got back. Nine hours until next train - decided to sleep at the station. We had just settled down for the night when some bloke came and told us to move on. He was being followed by a bloke with a fire hose so we weren't really in any position to argue. We managed to find a dry spot on the platform and we got to sleep at about 1:30.

            We were woken at 5:30 by some Yugoslav nutter on a tractor. We got up and walked around some shops and a market for about an hour. We bought food in a supermarket and just as we came out, we got caught in the storm that seems to have followed us from Innsbruck. We went to a cafe to shelter from the rain and to mentally prepare ourselves for the Belgrade to Athens run which we now had to do in one go (24 hours).

            We left the cafe at about 8 and had half an hour wait until the train was due to arrive. At 8:30, the train had not come in but we found some empty carriages on one of the platforms which had Athens on the side so we got on one of these. We were joined by two Danish girls, Annie and Bende who were also going to Athens and by a family of Yugoslavs. Throughout the journey, Chris and I were continually fed by the Yugoslavs and the Danish girls. We had only taken a loaf of bread (which had got wet) and a tin of tuna. We ended up having biscuits, cake, sweets, prawn spread and lemonade and orange juice to drink. At one point we discovered that we had to pay a supplement of about £1. Annie came to our rescue when she discovered that we had no dinars left. The Yugoslavs left the train before Skopje and we were joined instead by an English couple who were going to Thessalonika. I did not get much sleep until they left at about 3am.

            Woke at 7:30 while the other three were still asleep. The train was due in at 8:30 but from the stations we were passing, we worked out that it was about five hours late. Me and Chris passed the time by playing cards and then later by reading the brochures on various hostels which were being passed around. We decided that we would stay at Joys, the same one we had stayed at last year. We arrived in Athens at 2:15, five and three quarter hours late after an almost thirty hour journey. We made the ten minute walk to the hotel and went to book in. We could not get any double rooms so we had to share a room with Annie and Bende.

            After everyone had showered and changed we walked into town and up to The Acropolis which had not changed much since last year.

            On the way back we stopped and bought the girls a meal in return for the food they had given us. We all had moussaka and Greek salad and pints of Calsberg. Annie and Bende could not finish their Carlsberg so we helped them out. After the meal we returned to the hotel where the girls decided to be boring and have an early night. Me and Chris went out and had a pint and played backgammon until about 11. We went to the same bar we had been to last year. We got back at about 11:05 and went straight to sleep. Swansea lost away to Walsall on Saturday. My left arm has been mutilated by insects.

            Woke up at 10:20, as usual, more tired after a good night's sleep than if I'd had three hours sleep on a train. After getting dressed, we all walked back to the Plaka, the area around the foot of the Acropolis stopping in a cafe for cokes on the way. After walking round the flea market for an hour and a half we said goodbye to Annie and Bende and headed back to the hotel to collect our rucksacks. We left a message for Ga, etc telling them that we are not going to Italy by Fragline but with a different company whose tickets could be bought at the desk. Chances are they wont use the same hotel let alone find the note. We walked to the station where we found that we could have bought cheaper tickets from a travel agent!

        <p class="diary-text">
            We got on a train to Patras which pulled out on time at 3:42. Someone on the train had an English paper which we borrowed. Swansea lost at home to Plymouth on Monday and are now second from bottom. On the train, my rucksack fell off the luggage rack and hit me in the eye, a bit painful. I started reading a book "Duncton Wood" which I had bought for 111 Dr after haggling the price down from 285. I got bored with the book after about five pages so I spent the rest of the journey calculating how late we were and generally doing nothing. We arrived in Patras only half an hour late and boarded the boat straight away.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We went up onto the deck and found a spot to spend the night. We were sharing a part of the deck with four English girls, a German hippo and two obnoxious French pillocks. We struggled to get to sleep due to a gale force wind. Chris gibbed and went to sleep inside. I read 80 pages of Duncton Wood before falling asleep huddled behind the rucksack. It's raining at home!

            <span class="diary-date">Friday August 30th</span>
            Woke up at 7:30 and read a bit more of Duncton Wood. It's about moles, one of which can talk Welsh. We arrived in Corfu at 10 and walked along  looking for the Vatos bloke to give us a lift to the campsite. He was not there so we caught the bus.The price of the bus has gone up 5 Dr to 45 Dr. We arrived at the campsite at around 11 and pitched our tent near the spot we were last year. The campsite is a lot emptier this year due to us traveling two weeks later. I hung my Rush t-shirt on the washing line so that various parties meeting us would know where we were. We had cheese and ham omlettes for lunch (only 60p). After lunch, I phoned Regan to discover that him and Dave will be arriving on Monday. I told himi to find out when Callum and Huxley are going to be in Munich for the beer festival.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We spent the afternoon on Glyfada Beach, swimming, sun-bathing, etc. My left shoulder is peeling. The weather was quite good on the beach which we were glad about since it had been raining earlier while we were on the bus. On returning from the beach, we spent an hour in the bar drinking coke and writing postcards. We then decided to go for a run - 3 miles with 50 press-ups half way along. It was hard work. We both had showers and then changed to go out for the evening. We started off in the restaurant where I had a two course meal of omelette and chips. We went across the road to a bar where we played bar football and pool. We then went to Pam Pam's disco where they were having a lumumba night. The disco was quite good apart from the fact that we were the only two in it. We drank lumumbas all night - a cocktail consisting of metaxa, coconut liqueur and chocolate milk stuff. After several of these, we returned to the camp site for a pint and then went to bed at about 1:30. Chris slept in his tent and I slept on the floor outside.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday August 31st</span>
            Woke up at 10:20 and went to the restaurant for a cup of tea. Chris had bacon and eggs. I bought cheese and rolls from the shop (which has gone downhill since last year) and ate them by the tent. At 11:45 we went to the bar across the road where we had cokes and played bar football. We then walked the mile and a half to Myrtiotissa Beach where we spent three and a half hours swimming and sun-bathing. It seems we have already settled into the same daily routine we had last year. All we need now is for Regan to appear and leave his torch on every night!

        <p class="diary-text">
            We returned to the campsite by about 5 and sat in the bar listening to Brothers in Arms. We then went for a three and a half mile run again, doing 63 press-ups when we got back. After showering and changing, we went in search of Spiros Taverna. We could not find it so we came back down to Agrambellis where we had pizzas. The pizzas were quiet good but the service was terrible. We had to wait about twenty minutes just to get the bill. We left there at 10 and went to Dezas (Country Club) which was closed until 10:30 so we killed time playing bar football. When we returned to Dezas, it was totally empty and we discovered that Punch Night was tomorrow night, not tonight. We returned to the campsite bar where we had metaxas. Chris didn't like it. We went to bed at about 11:30 but took ages to get to sleep due to the hardness of the ground and David Bowie blaring out from the bar.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday September 1st</span>
            Was woken at 10 by Annie and Bente. They are planning to stay here for about a week. I waited first for Chris to return from breakfast and then for Anni and Bente and then we all headed for the beach. We waited 40 minutes for the bus to Glyfada where we spent about four hours. Chris tried to go water skiing but the queue was too long so we hired a canoe instead. We returned to Vatos at 5 and went for a run straight away. It was much too hot.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After showering, we collected the girls and went to the bar for a drink. We went from there to the taverna down the road where I had spaghetti bolognaise. The girls insisted on paying which was quite solid. We returned to the campsite bar where we spent two hours. Chris was drinking Bacardis at 100 Dr a go. We joined up with a group of Swedes and all went to Pam Pam's again. It was quite good this time. They had a special offer on beer which bought the prices down to nearly normal. I met a German bloke who liked Marillion. He is the first person I have met who has actually heard of them. Chris disappeared outside for about an hour with Bente. I'm not sure what time we came back but I know I slept well.

            Woke at about 10 with slight hangover. Chris went to the beach with Anni and Bente while I stayed and waited for Dave. I spent the morning reading and sleeping in the shade. Dave arrived at 2:30 and we went straight to the bar. We were still there at 6 when Regan arrived. At about 6:30 I think I went for a shower and then returned to the bar. We had a pint and then went down the road for tea (spaghetti again). We spent the remainder of the evening drinking, either in the bar or in one of the two discos. At one point I fell over and tore my trousers. When we finally left the bar, we returned to the tent where we continued drinking while listening to Regan's cassette player.

            Regained consciousness at about 10 and went for breakfast in the restaurant. We spent about an hour trying to work out what happened last night. Regan left his cassette player on all night. Me and Dave played bar football across the road while Regan and Chris walked to Myrtiotissa Beach. We followed them about an hour later. We spent about four hours on the beach, all suffering in the heat. We returned to the cammpsite at about 5 and spent an hour showering, etc. We went for a pint in the bar and then went down the  road for a meal - spag bol and chips. We then came back to the bar and played bar football. Regan bought us all retsinas which is the momst discusting drink I have ever tasted. We all had cocktails in the campsite bar (I had banana colada) and then went to Pam Pam's. We went with the Danish girls and all the Swedes we met a couple of days ago. Me and Dave were the last to leave getting well pissed on metaxa before leaving. We went to The Country Club for about half an hour and then went back to the campsite where apparently I tried to pull Regan's tent down before going to bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday September 3rd</span>
            Woke at about 10 and went to the restaurant for an omelette. England had won the ashes. As me and Dave both had hangovers we decided not to go to the beach but to go into town instead. We waited about 20 minutes for the bus and then got bored so we hired mopeds instead. They were solid fun but a bit slow it took about half an hour to get into town. We spent about two hours in town stopping at various places for food while we walked around. For the remainder of the aftenoon we tried to find a beach somewhere along the East coast of the island. We went for about 20 minutes without finding anything so we settled for a hotel swimming pool. It took about quarter an hour for me to start my moped when we tried to leave the hotel.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We returned to the campsite just before 6 and as we still had an hour before the mopeds had to be returned we went to Ermones Beach. The beach was pretty grotty so we went up to the hotel swimming pool. Dave's bike nearly packed in on the way up. There was smoke pouring out of it by the time we reached the top. We returned the bikes and went for a pint in the bar before going out for meals. Chris had chicken and chips, moussaka and chips and spaghetti bolognaise. I just had two spaghettis. We started talking to a group of drunk English golfers on the table next to us. They were all tellingg jokes that they thought were very funny. Regan told them a joke and they didn't speak to us again!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We went back to the tent at 12:30 and started drinking Regan's wine. It was discusting so we went to bed. Struggled to get to sleep due to lack of alcohol.
