            Left Ammanford at 3:30 and drove to Dinas Powys where we picked up Gareth and then proceeded to the Severn Bridge Services. Elfan turned up with Jacqueline and Alun and there was a lot of confusion when we told him we had to pick up Chris as well. Gareth spent the journey talking to Alun about The Beano and playing with Lego.

            We arrived at Victoria Station at about 8:45 and met Olwyn, Nick and Aleks. After buying tickets and having a pint, we caught the 9:53 train to Dover Priory. We arrived in Dover at 12:10 and went by bus to the docks. We all went through the terminal collecting boarding passes on the way. Ga got a pass for the wrong boat and had to go and change it. We boarded the boat and left Dover at 1:00 am. We spent most of the journey gambling at fruit machines and the blackjack table. I won £1.50, Ga lost £2 and Chris finished about even.

            We arrived in Calais at about 3:30 and then had an hour and a half wait for a bus connection to the town. When we reached town, we got on the train to Paris which left about an hour later at 6:16. I was distressed because we didn't get our tickets stamped. We got to Paris at about 9:15 and went to a cafe where we were charged about £8 for five coffees and a few croissants.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We then went by metro to Paris Austerlitz where we were due to leave from later. We then embarked on a round Paris sight-seeing trip starting off at Notre Dame and then heading for the Eiffel Tower. We stopped en route to buy French loaves and cheese which we ate on the way. We arrived at the Eiffel Tower at 2pm and at 2:15, Beth arrived with her friend plus friend's mum. We all went up to the second stage (except Nick and Olwyn) and then lost Beth and party because they went to the top. We continued our tour along the Champs-Élysées. Me, Ga and Aleks went up to the top of the Arc de Triumph from where the view was as good as from the Eiffel Tower.

            We got the metro back to The Latin Quarter where we eventually found an Italian restaurant which was quite reasonable. We were all glad to sit down after a very tiring day. I had pate, pizza and mousse + half a pint of Carlsberg + half a carafe of wine. We left the restaurant and returned to the station where we retrieved our rucksacks and proceeded to get thrown out of two bars in the space of about five minutes (through no fault of our own). We boarded the train to Toulouse at 9:55 and it pulled out of the station on time at 10:56

            Woke up at about 7 and woke Ga and Aleks. The train arrived in Toulouse at 7:03 and we then caught a train to Agde which got in at about 9. We then got taxis to the campsite where Cathy and Linda were staying. We found their caravan and broke in due to lack of key. After dumping our rucksacks and changing, we went to the beach which is only about 100 yards away. Spent the rest of the morning swimming and sun-bathing.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We had French bread, Brie & bottles of lager for lunch. The whole lot only cost about £1. We stayed on the beach until about 3 and then showered and changed for the evening. We bought cheese, bread and lager again for tea and then me and Chris went to watch a wet t-shirt competition. We then went back to the caravan and played cards and drank lager until Cathy and Linda returned and then went to a local bar where we had a couple of pints and everyone had beefburgers.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
            When we got back to the caravan we started drinking vodka which was a bad move as I don't remember anything after that. Apparently we all went to a disco before I was carried back to the caravan. Me, Nick, Ga and Chris all slept in an empty caravan next to Cathy and Linda's.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Monday August 19th</span>
            Woke up at about 9 with slight hangover and slight sunburn. Had croissants for breakfast and then after washing and shaving, Ga and me went for a quick swim. We hung about by the caravan for a bit and then went and hired pedalos for an hour. By this time my hangover had got worse and the heat wasn't helping. We had lunch of bread and Brie again (3rd meal in a row) and generally lazed about. Swansea lost 1 - 0 to Wigan on Saturday - it looks like they could struggle again. I went for a lie down after lunch due to hangover.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After recovering, we played cards and went swimming and then showered, etc. We went out to a pizzeria for tea and all had cheese and ham pizzas. I had about twice as much as everyone else as they couldn't finish theirs! We went back from there to the caravan where we drank lager until about 8:30. We then went to the bar to watch a cabaret act put on by the couriers (it was abysmal). While we were there, Cathy kept us supplied with drinks which were smuggled in and hidden under the table.

            At midnight the DJ played a request for Aleks as it was her 21st birthday. We danced to the record and then went and threw her in the sea. We all ended up going swimming and when we came out of the sea discovered that Aleks had lost her bra! After a lot of looking we gave up and went back to the caravan where we finished off the wine and some of the vodka. Everyone staggered off to bed at about 2:30.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday August 20th</span>
            We got up at 7 as Cathy and Linda had to be out of the caravan by 9. We took our rucksacks to reception and left them with the couriers to look after - they treat us as if we are paying guests. We tidied up the caravan and killed time until about 10 when we went on a coach trip to Aqualand which is a huge complex of swimming pools and long windy water chutes. Some of the slides were quite frightening from the top but once you had started on them they were great fun.. Me and Chris shared a water melon for lunch. We stayed at Aqualand until about 4 and then returned to the campsite and collected our rucksacks. We said goodbye to Cathy and Linda and then caught taxis into Agde.

            Olwyn looked after our bags at the station while we went shopping (we bought bread, pate and tuna) and then returned to the station to catch the 5:56 train to Avignon. My ears had got sunburnt ( as well as my back and arms). Olwyn disappeared just as we were getting ready to catch the train but she arrived back with about a minute to go. We arrived in Avignon at 7:21 and had abotu an hour to kill before our next train. We walked from the station to a bar and me, Ga and Aleks left our rucksacks with Chris, Nick and Olwyn while we went sight-seeing for twenty minutes. We walked about half a mile up the road and came to a large square with a merry-go-round in the middle of it. We all had a go which cost 6Fr. When it finished, we all asked a woman to take photos of us while we sat on the horses. Ga was explaining to the woman how to use his camera when the merry-go-round started up again. The woman with the cameras was confused already but at this point she gave up and left. Me and Aleks had to jump off as a bloke came round asking for tickets.

            When we had recovered from this ordeal, we returned to the bar for a half and then went to the station to catch the 8:36 to Strasbourg. We arrived in Lyon at 10:56 and discovered that there was over an hour before the train left again. Me, Ga and Aleks walked into the town centre of Lyon and had hamburgers in McDonalds. When we arrived back at the station we couldn't find the others and at one point were quite worried that the train might have gone or something. We eventually found them and re-boarded the train for a seven hour train journey to Strasbourg. (Linda found Aleks' bra on the beach this morning)

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday August 21st</span>
            We arrived in Strasbourg at about 8 and spent an hour sorting out lockers, phoning youth hostels, etc. We then went sight-seeing. Me, Chris, Ga and Aleks went off and arranged to meet Nick and Olwyn back at the station at 3. We walked around the town for a bit and then went out to the University area looking for somewhere cheap to eat. Ga bought a bunch of bananas. We walked through some botanical gardens where Ga ate some berries from a tree. We walked to the cathedral stopping for chocolate croissants and hot chocolate. The cathedral was quite solid especially the astronomical clock

            We met Nick and Olwyn at the post office and we all climbed to the top of the cathedral. Chris went off for lunch with Nick and Olwyn while me, Ga and Aleks went into the cathedral and then went to buy postcards and read papers. England won the 5th test but Swansea lost 2 - 1 at Cardiff. We went into Marks and Spencer and bought ham and hula hoops for lunch which we at in a park under a tree. Ga climbed up the tree.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We returned to the station  to meet the others and caught the 3:15 to Mannheim. We spent the train journey avoiding the guard so as not to pay a supplement. Ga and Aleks got caught. When we got to Mannheim, we walked to a youth hostel where I had to pay £15 to join and for two nights B & B. I was not overjoyed to say the least. Me, Nick and  Ga were sharing a room with two foreign blokes. Me and Ga went for a run around the park and then came back for a shower. We discovered that the two foreign blokes were British, one from  Cardiff and one had done English at Swansea University (At Mannheim station, we found a brochure of Swansea Uni showing pictures of Clyne and the warden's dog).
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening, we walked around the town and went to McDonalds for tea (except for Aleks who stayed in for an early night). I only had a cheeseburger due to no money. We walked back though the town and then went back to the hostel. We left Olwyn there and went back into town and found a bar that was relatively cheap. We had a couple of pints each and returned to the hostel by 11:15.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday August 22nd</span>
            Woke up at 7:15 and went to breakfast which consisted of bread and jam and cup of tea. After washing and tidying up our room, we went into town and caught the 9:22 to Heidelberg. We arrived in Heidelberg at 9:34 and set off to go sight-seeing. On the way Ga tried to hurdle a barrier but caught his foot and fell over - dead funny. We walked about half a mile to the university and went to the student's prison which was quite interesting.

            We walked from there to the castle and saw the biggest wine barrel in the world - 220,000 litres. After we left the castle, we walked down the hill and everyone bought food except me and Ga and we all went and sat by the river for lunch. After lunch, we walked up a mountain to Philosopher's Point and then further up to an amphitheater and a church. We had a pint each while we were up there and then me and Chris had a race down the mountain against Nick and Ga. The idea was to get to the bottom of the hill, change money and get to the main square. Me and Chris won easily but Nick and Ga refused to buy the pints which had been bet at the start.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We sat around a fountain for about an hour. Ga bought a Big Mac, Chris and I bought pints from a supermarket for about 20p. We had to ask someone for a bottle opener and we got talking to two English hitch-hikers and a group of pissed Germans. We left when one of the Germans started saying what good boxers the English were. Aleks got stung by a wasp in a bread shop. We caught a train back to Mannheim and returned to the youth hostel. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            Chris and I went for a run then after showering we went into town, predictably to a McDonalds. I had a Big Mac. We then went to the bar we had been in the night before and all had a pint except Ga who had two. Olwyn and Aleks met us at the bar and we all walked back to the hostel by 10:30. we had two Finns sleeping in our room so we sat outside and talked until 11:30.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday August 23rd</span>
            Woke at 7 and had breakfast of bread and jam again. We left the hostel at about 9 and walked to the station (Ga hurdled a gate and broke his rucksack) where we killed time for an hour writing postcards, etc. We caught the 10:22 to Heidelberg and then go the 10:48 to Munich. Arrived in Munich at about 2:30 and then spent an hour sorting out lockers, etc. Aleks' shampoo had emptied into her rucksack.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We caught the tube to Marienplatz, the main shopping centre and I bought ham and rolls. We took our food and sat in a beer  garden where we ate and drank steins. There was a lot of confusion over the next days plans so we spent about an hour discussing what we were all going to do. We decided to walk to the university having a quick look at buildings, etc en route. We got to a beer garden where we all had steins except Olwyn. We stayed for about two hours and me and Ga had three steins each. Neither of us remember leaving the beer garden.

            During the course of the evening, we had a vote and decided that we should go to Istanbul on the way to Greece (two 21 hour journeys, silly idea). We went to sleep in the station, Ga sleeping in a different place to everyone else for some unknown reason. Munich seems to be quite a solid place, we missed most of it last year.
