            Left Ammanford at 3:30 and drove to Dinas Powys where we picked up Gareth and then proceeded to the Severn Bridge Services. Elfan turned up with Jacqueline and Alun and there was a lot of confusion when we told him we had to pick up Chris as well. Gareth spent the journey talking to Alun about The Beano and playing with Lego.

            We arrived at Victoria Station at about 8:45 and met Olwyn, Nick and Aleks. After buying tickets and having a pint, we caught the 9:53 train to Dover Priory. We arrived in Dover at 12:10 and went by bus to the docks. We all went through the terminal collecting boarding passes on the way. Ga got a pass for the wrong boat and had to go and change it. We boarded the boat and left Dover at 1:00 am. We spent most of the journey gambling at fruit machines and the blackjack table. I won £1.50, Ga lost £2 and Chris finished about even.

            We arrived in Calais at about 3:30 and then had an hour and a half wait for a bus connection to the town. When we reached town, we got on the train to Paris which left about an hour later at 6:16. I was distressed because we didn't get our tickets stamped. We got to Paris at about 9:15 and went to a cafe where we were charged about £8 for five coffees and a few croissants.

            We then went by metro to Paris Austerlitz where we were due to leave from later. We then embarked on a round Paris sight-seeing trip starting off at Notre Dame and then heading for the Eiffel Tower. We stopped en route to buy French loaves and cheese which we ate on the way. We arrived at the Eiffel Tower at 2pm and at 2:15, Beth arrived with her friend plus friend's mum. We all went up to the second stage (except Nick and Olwyn) and then lost Beth and party because they went to the top. We continued our tour along the Champs-Élysées. Me, Ga and Aleks went up to the top of the Arc de Triumph from where the view was as good as from the Eiffel Tower.

            We got the metro back to The Latin Quarter where we eventually found an Italian restaurant which was quite reasonable. We were all glad to sit down after a very tiring day. I had pate, pizza and mousse + half a pint of Carlsberg + half a carafe of wine. We left the restaurant and returned to the station where we retrieved our rucksacks and proceeded to get thrown out of two bars in the space of about five minutes (through no fault of our own). We boarded the train to Toulouse at 9:55 and it pulled out of the station on time at 10:56
