            We left Kingsclere just before 2, stopped in Basingstoke for sandwiches and petrol and were on our way to Dover by about 2:30. It was an uneventful journey and we were in Dover by about 4:30. We checked into the same Travelodge that we stayed in in February and went out for the evening just before 5.

            We started off by walking out to The Breakwater Brewery and Tap about a mile North of the town centre. This was a place we had not been to before but was worth the walk. It had live music and an excellent range of beers and was quite busy for a Sunday evening. We had a few in there before walking back to the Wetherspoons. We both had curries in here and finished the evening with a litre of wine. Back in the hotel by about 9:30.

            We checked out of the hotel at 7 and had a two minute drive to the port. There were no queues at all at the port and we were through immigration in a couple of minutes. We were booked on the 8:00 ferry to Dunkirk but were offered the 7:40 sailing to Calais which we accepted. 
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            The ferry was very empty so there was plenty of room. We got to Calais on time and were off the ferry and on the motorway towards Belgium by 10:30, French time. First stop was at XL in Adenkirk to get rid of our empty bottles and buy more, mainly Mort Subite, beer. We also stopped at a supermarket on the outskirts of Bruges for chocolates and a few beers that we were unable to get in Adenkirk. We found the car-park by the station without too many problems and were parked by about 1:30. From there it was a 10 - 15  minute walk to the Ibis that we had stayed in last time we were here in the summer. We were able to check in straight away. We had quick showers before heading back down to start the day's drinking.

            As we did on our last visit to Bruges, we started with our complimentary Bruges Triples in the Ibis bar. Next was Bierpaleis. This was not as good as it was in the summer as we had to sit inside. We walked from there to 't Brugs Beertje where we spent a very enjoyable two and a half hours. This was a lot more crowded than we had expected it to be and the only place to sit was at the bar. There are not that many tourists around compared to the summer but with everyone having to drink inside, places are all a lot fuller.

            After four in there, we made our way across the main square towards Cambrinus. The cafe was closed again (this looks to be permanent) so we continued walking to the brasserie. By now it was peak time for eating and there was a queue to get in. When we did get to the front, we were not able to get a table as we were not eating. We gave up on that and went to The Monk, a place we had not been to before. This was more of a pub type place compared to some of the nicer bars but it had a good range of beers and was fine for a quick drink. We had one in 't Poatersgat and another in Le Trappiste before heading back to the hotel.

            I was up at about 9:30 and went out to buy breakfast. The Panos in town was closed meaning a longer walk back to the station but we had breakfast just after 10. The weather at this point was quite nice but rain was forecast for later in the day so we decided to head straight out for a walk. We had decided to walk out to the Fort Lapin brewery which is just over a mile away. We knew that the brewery itself would not be open but we were keen to have a look at the shop to see if the beer was cheaper than it was in town. We bought a couple of bottles of their Triple as well as another sign and a glass before walking back to the hotel

            We went out again at 3 by which time the predicted rain had started. We decided that it would be a good idea to eat something today before starting to drink so we went first to FritBar. We both had the loaded fries accompanied by our first beer of the day.... an 11% Straffe Hendrik Quadruple in my case. After eating, we walked to the brewery. The only times we had been here before we had sat outside by the canal. Today we were inside which was also very nice. As usual, we both had the tasting flights and stayed there until just before it closed at 6.

            After a quick look round the Christmas shop, we went for a couple of house triples in De Garre before going back to 't Brugs Beertje - still our favourite bar in Bruges. We got through five beers between us in here while sat at the bar again before returning to Le Trappiste for our final beers of the trip

            We checked out of the hotel at 10, walked back to the station and had breakfast (Panos again) sat in the car. We had planned to go back to the supermarket for more beer but a road closure put in end to that idea. We drove instead directly to Calais where we did go to a large Carrefour by the tunnel entrance and stocked up on wine and a few more bottles of beer. By the time we were at the ferry terminal, it was about 1:45. We were booked on the 2:20 ferry and were on the boat about 10 minutes after getting to the terminal.
