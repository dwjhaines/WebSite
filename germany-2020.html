            Due to covid-19, our planned trip to Bonaire had become a trip to Germany. As with our trip last month, it was a 4am start and we left Kingsclere just before 4:30. It was another easy drive down to Folkestone and after filling up with petrol, we were at the Euro Tunnel terminal by about 6:25. There was only one train an hour going today so we were not able to get on an earlier train than the 7:50 which we had booked. The train left on time and we were in France by about 9:30.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We stopped off at the Beer Shop Noel Cuvelier again to get rid of a few empties and buy another seven crates of Belgium beer and also stopped at a tobacco shop just over the border, before continuing our drive through France, Belgium and Luxembourg to Saarbrücken, just over the German border. We arrived in Saarbrücken at about 4pm, having driven about 460 miles, and found our hotel (Ibis Budget) without any problems. We were both worn out by this time but we checked in, had quick showers and went straight out to have a look around the town.

			We had a walk of about a mile into the centre and stopped for our first beer just before we got to the main part of the town. The place we stopped at (Hilde & Heinz)  had a couple of the local specialties on their menu (Dibbelabbes and Merguez) so we ordered food and had another couple of beers. After eating, we went to look at the two main sights of Saarbrücken - the Johanneskirche and the Rathaus. We had a beer in the Ratskeller and then walked into the main part of the town. We did not have high expectations of the bars of Saarbrücken but the centre was quite lively and we found a couple of decent places to drink, both being most notable for their glasses..... which we inevitably ended up taking away with us as souvenirs! We had one more in a bar half way back to the hotel and were in bed sometime around 11.

            Today was probably the worst day's driving we have ever had in Germany. We only had to go about 200 miles to Ulm but the journey ended up taking more than five and a half hours. There were a lot of roadworks and a lot of traffic and a few places where we were not on motorways. We had a delay early on of about 45 minutes due to a break down in one of the many contra-flows and the whole journey seemed to be one traffic jam after another. We had a stop for petrol and to buy breakfast and another stop at a picnic area to eat. We eventually arrived at the B+B Hotel in Neu Ulm at about 3:45.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had chosen the B+B as it has free parking and they will let us leave the car there while we spend the next week cycling round Bavaria. After checking in and unloading the car, we went out on our bikes. We started by heading West, up The Danube but in a repeat of the ride we did here last year, managed to lose The Danube after a few miles and headed up the Iller instead. It was a nice enough ride of about 16 miles and we ended up at the beer garden that last year was owned by Barfüßer. We knew that it was no longer owned by Barfüßer but did not know whether or not it would still be open so were glad to find that it was. We were lucky enough to get there on the first day of their "Octoberfest" so there was quite a good atmosphere with live music and Paulaner Octoberfest beer.

			We had a few in there before cycling back to the hotel for showers. We then walked into Ulm and to the Barfüßer Brewery for a few more beers and a pizza. We found an excellent small local bar on the way back to the hotel (Posthorn) and stopped in there for our final drinks of the evening.

			Ulm -> Donauwörth - 58.15 miles - 467 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We were up by 9ish, put the things we do not need for the next week in the car and loaded everything else onto the bikes...... well onto my bike to be precise! We left the hotel just after 10 and cycled into the centre of Ulm for breakfast. We left Ulm and started cycling down the Donauradweg just after 11.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Today was a very enjoyable day on the bikes. Our original schedule had been to stop in Dillingen for the night, a distance of 55km. However, we had thought it would be possible to go another 40km and reach Donauwörth and this is what we ended up doing. The cycling was very easy, mainly on flat surfaced paths and the weather was perfect all day. We had a couple of water stops and a  lunch break at a Lidl outside Höchstädt. We managed to stay on the cycle route just about all the way although did somehow manage to come off it a couple of miles before we got to Donauwörth. We arrived in Donauwörth just after 4pm.

			We did not have any accommodation booked for tonight as we did not know how far we would be going. We tried a couple of hotels which were full before ending up getting a room at The Goldener Hirsch Hotel at the top end of the main street. Although the cycling had not been that hard today, we had still done over 58 miles and it had been hot so we were both worn out and dehydrated by the time we arrived. We had an hour in the room while we recovered and followed the first day of the football season before going out for a walk around Donauwörth.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			There were no sights that we really wanted to see (we were here just over a year ago) but it is a very nice town centre to wander around. We were going to stop somewhere for a drink but did not find anywhere that looked any  better than our hotel so ended up back there. We had a few beers before eating and then moved to a table inside for a few more. At 10 as the bar was closing, we bought another couple of beers and took them up to the room where we spent an  hour chatting to Hoggy, Sarah and Cathy before going to bed.

			Donauwörth -> Ingolstadt- 41.12 miles - 825 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We had breakfast included so ate in the hotel before setting off again just after 10. It was another enjoyable journey. The route was a bit more hilly than it had been yesterday and we spent a lot of time away from the river but the parts of the river that we were on were very scenic. The highlight of the journey was probably Neuberg, a very spectacular town right on The Danube. We got into Ingolstadt at around 2:30 and cycled out to the hotel which Roz had booked which was about 2km the other side of town.

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz had chosen the hotel as it had a small pool. She went and lay by it for an hour or so and we walked back into town at 5ish. We had a walk around the main sights of the old town, the munster and one of the old gates, and then had an early meal at a burger restaurant. We had seen the burgers in the restaurant (Hans Im Glück Burgergrill) as we had walked towards the munster and decided to go back and eat there.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			 We were both totally worn out by this time and were back at the hotel by 7:30 for a much needed earlier and more sober night than we have been having recently. The last few days have been quite tiring from the 4am start on Thursday, three nights of drinking plus all the cycling in quite warm temperatures. We were both asleep by 9pm.
