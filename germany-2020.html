        Due to covid-19, our planned trip to Bruges and Ghent had become a trip to Arras and Lille..... and then a trip to Aachen and Lille. Loaded the car with about 350 empty Belgian beer bottles and two bikes in preparation for an early start tomorrow.

			We were up at 4am and left the house by 4:30. The lack of traffic at that time meant that we had a very quick journey to Folkestone. By just after 6:30, we had filled up with petrol and checked in at the Euro Tunnel. We were booked on the 7:50 train but were able to get on the slightly earlier one at 7:36. As usual, here, boarding all went very smoothly, the train left on time and we were in France just after 9am local time.
        </p>
		<p>
			We were still able to stay in France but with new restrictions likely to come in during the next 48 hours, we had decided to go straight into Germany and stay in Aachen for a couple of nights before re-assessing our plans. We still wanted to pick up Belgian beer so although technically not allowed, we first drove to "Beer Shop Noel Cuvelier", which is about 500m the other side of the Belgian border, a shop we had visited before on our way out of Poperinge. We got rid of all our empties and stocked up with just over 250 new bottles including four cases of Mort Subite gueze.

			We did the rest of the journey without stopping again and arrived in Aachen just after 2pm. We had booked two nights at the Europaplatz Mercure which was easy to find a couple of minutes away from the motorway. We checked in and went straight to spend an hour or so by the outdoor pool.
		</p>
			At 3:30, I reassembled the bikes and we headed off to Vaals, a town just over the Dutch border that we had stopped in for a drink a couple of years ago. We went to a different bar this time - Cafe Vereinshoes where we had our first beers of the trip. Although not quite up to the standards of some Belgian bars, this was a nice enough bar with a range of about 40 bottles and 8 more on tap. I had three of the Le Trappe Tripels. Roz had one Le Trappe and a couple of Le Choufes. Already feeling quite light-headed we cycled the five miles back to the hotel stopping for a wheat beer in another bar (Kölnthor) on the way.
		<p>
			We locked up the bikes in the hotel, had showers and a bottle of Le Chouffe each and then returned to Kölnthor where we spent the rest of the evening. We had planned to eat there but instead just spent a couple of hours drinking wheat beer before walking back to the hotel.

		<H2>Friday 14th August</H2>
        <p>
			We woke to the news that France and The Netherlands have been added to the list of countries we are not allowed to go to so had to change our plans once again. We had already decided to extend our stay in Aachen to three nights but now will stay for four. The Mercure where we are staying is full tomorrow so we booked two nights at the Novotel in the centre. After we had breakfast, we spent a few hours by the pool.
        </p>
		<p>
			We spent an hour or so in the afternoon trying, unsuccessfully to sort out Roz's phone which can not get a data connection and then went out on our bikes again. We cycled into Belgium and went for a beer at the Ratskeller in Klemis. Again we were not technically supposed to visit Belgium but it is only just over the border so we did not think it was too big a risk.

			We cycled from there over the hill to Vaals for another beer in Cafe Vereinshoes before cycling back to Aachen. We had planned on going back into Aachen but it was quite late by the time we got back and we ended up having an early night instead.

        <p>
			We got up and cycled into Aachen for breakfast. We locked up our bikes near the Rathaus and ate near the cathedral. We had a walk around the centre and then took our bikes to the Novotel before walking back to the Mercure. We had just under an hour by the pool after checking out and left when it started to rain. We filled up with petrol and drove back to the Novotel where we checked in just after 1pm.
        </p>
		<p>
			We went out to start drinking again at 3ish. We headed for Im alten Zollhaus about a mile away but found the Hopfen+Malz Beer Shop on the way so stopped there for one.  We went for a couple in Im alten Zollhaus and another in Goldenes Schwein before returning to Hopfen+Malz for two more. We ate at the Aachener Brauhaus with a couple more beers and then
