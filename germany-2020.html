            Due to covid-19, our planned trip to Bonaire had become a trip to Germany. As with our trip last month, it was a 4am start and we left Kingsclere just before 4:30. It was another easy drive down to Folkestone and after filling up with petrol, we were at the Euro Tunnel terminal by about 6:25. There was only one train an hour going today so we were not able to get on an earlier train than the 7:50 which we had booked. The train left on time and we were in France by about 9:30.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We stopped off at the Beer Shop Noel Cuvelier again to get rid of a few empties and buy another seven crates of Belgium beer and also stopped at a tobacco shop just over the border, before continuing our drive through France, Belgium and Luxembourg to Saarbrücken, just over the German border. We arrived in Saarbrücken at about 4pm, having driven about 460 miles, and found our hotel (Ibis Budget) without any problems. We were both worn out by this time but we checked in, had quick showers and went straight out to have a look around the town.
        </p>

			We had a walk of about a mile into the centre and stopped for our first beer just before we got to the main part of the town. The place we stopped at (Hilde & Heinz)  had a couple of the local specialties on their menu (Dibbelabbes and Merguez) so we ordered food and had another couple of beers. After eating, we went to look at the two main sights of Saarbrücken - the Johanneskirche and the Rathaus. We had a beer in the Ratskeller and then walked into the main part of the town. We did not have high expectations of the bars of Saarbrücken but the centre was quite lively and we found a couple of decent places to drink, both being most notable for their glasses..... which we inevitably ended up taking away with us as souvenirs! We had one more in a bar half way back to the hotel and were in bed sometime around 11.

            Today was probably the worst day's driving we have ever had in Germany. We only had to go about 200 miles to Ulm but the journey ended up taking more than five and a half hours. There were a lot of roadworks and a lot of traffic and a few places where we were not on motorways. We had a delay early on of about 45 minutes due to a break down in one of the many contra-flows and the whole journey seemed to be one traffic jam after another. We had a stop for petrol and to buy breakfast and another stop at a picnic area to eat. We eventually arrived at the B+B Hotel in Neu Ulm at about 3:45.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had chosen the B+B as it has free parking and they will let us leave the car there while we spend the next week cycling round Bavaria. After checking in and unloading the car, we went out on our bikes. We started by heading West, up The Danube but in a repeat of the ride we did here last year, managed to lose The Danube after a few miles and headed up the Iller instead. It was a nice enough ride of about 16 miles and we ended up at the beer garden that last year was owned by Barfüßer. We knew that it was no longer owned by Barfüßer but did not know whether or not it would still be open so were glad to find that it was. We were lucky enough to get there on the first day of their "Octoberfest" so there was quite a good atmosphere with live music and Paulaner Octoberfest beer.

			We had a few in there before cycling back to the hotel for showers. We then walked into Ulm and to the Barfüßer Brewery for a few more beers and a pizza. We found an excellent small local bar on the way back to the hotel (Posthorn) and stopped in there for our final drinks of the evening.

			Ulm -> Donauwörth - 58.15 miles - 467 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We were up by 9ish, put the things we do not need for the next week in the car and loaded everything else onto the bikes...... well onto my bike to be precise! We left the hotel just after 10 and cycled into the centre of Ulm for breakfast. We left Ulm and started cycling down the Donauradweg just after 11.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Today was a very enjoyable day on the bikes. Our original schedule had been to stop in Dillingen for the night, a distance of 55km. However, we had thought it would be possible to go another 40km and reach Donauwörth and this is what we ended up doing. The cycling was very easy, mainly on flat surfaced paths and the weather was perfect all day. We had a couple of water stops and a  lunch break at a Lidl outside Höchstädt. We managed to stay on the cycle route just about all the way although did somehow manage to come off it a couple of miles before we got to Donauwörth. We arrived in Donauwörth just after 4pm.

			We did not have any accommodation booked for tonight as we did not know how far we would be going. We tried a couple of hotels which were full before ending up getting a room at The Goldener Hirsch Hotel at the top end of the main street. Although the cycling had not been that hard today, we had still done over 58 miles and it had been hot so we were both worn out and dehydrated by the time we arrived. We had an hour in the room while we recovered and followed the first day of the football season before going out for a walk around Donauwörth.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			There were no sights that we really wanted to see (we were here just over a year ago) but it is a very nice town centre to wander around. We were going to stop somewhere for a drink but did not find anywhere that looked any  better than our hotel so ended up back there. We had a few beers before eating and then moved to a table inside for a few more. At 10 as the bar was closing, we bought another couple of beers and took them up to the room where we spent an  hour chatting to Hoggy, Sarah and Cathy before going to bed.

			Donauwörth -> Ingolstadt- 41.12 miles - 825 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We had breakfast included so ate in the hotel before setting off again just after 10. It was another enjoyable journey. The route was a bit more hilly than it had been yesterday and we spent a lot of time away from the river but the parts of the river that we were on were very scenic. The highlight of the journey was probably Neuberg, a very spectacular town right on The Danube. We got into Ingolstadt at around 2:30 and cycled out to the hotel which Roz had booked which was about 2km the other side of town.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			Roz had chosen the hotel as it had a small pool. She went and lay by it for an hour or so and we walked back into town at 5ish. We had a walk around the main sights of the old town, the munster and one of the old gates, and then had an early meal at a burger restaurant. We had seen the burgers in the restaurant (Hans Im Glück Burgergrill) as we had walked towards the munster and decided to go back and eat there.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			 We were both totally worn out by this time and were back at the hotel by 7:30 for a much needed earlier and more sober night than we have been having recently. The last few days have been quite tiring from the 4am start on Thursday, three nights of drinking plus all the cycling in quite warm temperatures. We were both asleep by 9pm.

			Ingolstadt -> Weltenburg - 31.65 miles - 414 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            Today was the day I had been most looking forward to on the cycle ride due to the two breweries we would visit. Although we had talked about a later start today, we were up earl and after breakfast in the hotel, were on our way just after 9:00. It was an easy 31 mile ride down to Weltenburg Abbey (Kloster Weltenburg), a Benedictine monastery..... also home to what it claims to be is"the oldest monastic brewery in the world".
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived at the abbey at just after 1pm. The first thing we saw as we got to the entrance was a huge queue to get in. This was totally unexpected but was due to everyone having to register contact details and wait to be shown to tables. We locked up our bikes and joined the queue. After counting the number of people in the queue and watching how quickly it was moving, it looked as if we would have a wait of at least 30 minutes just to get into the beer garden. We thought about not bothering which would have been very disappointing as this should have been one of the highlights of the trip. However, the queue started to move a bit more quickly and we were inside and sat down about 20 minutes after arriving.

		<p class="diary-text">
			Once inside, the beer garden was superb. We had visited here with Dave 17 years ago  but did not really have much memory of the place. Today, we were able to spend more time here and it was all very enjoyable. I had four glasses of the dunkel beer that is brewed here while Roz stuck to the wheat beer. An excellent way of spending the afternoon.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At 4pm, we got on the boat that travels down through the Danube Gorge to Kelheim. We did have the option of a 6km hilly bike ride but the boat journey is quite spectacular and seemed like a much better idea particularly after the amount we had had to drink. We were in Kelheim at about 4:25 and had a short ride to The Dormero Hotel where we had booked a room for the night. After checking in, having showers and a beer in the room, we went out to the second brewery of the day - Schneider Weisse.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			We had not known  until researching this trip that Kelheim was the home of Schneider Weisse. The beer garden in their restaurant next to the brewery was every bit as good as the one this afternoon. We ate in there while trying a few of the wheat beers including a couple at over 8%. We were in there for a couple of hours before deciding to leave before we were too drunk. We had a few more beers outside a restaurant in the centre of Kelheim before returning to the hotel.

			Kelheim -> Regensburg - 51.31 miles - 508 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We checked out of the hotel and were on our way again by 9:30. We headed out of Kelheim the wrong way initially to buy breakfast then headed back through the centre to the Donau - Main canal where we sat and ate what we had just bought. It was a fairly easy ride down to Regensburg where we had planned to end our cycling. It was just under 25 miles and quite flat so we were in the centre of Regensburg by about 1pm.
        </p>

			We decided at this point that we would continue along the Danube to Straubing, the next big town, about 55km away. As we left Regensburg, we either missed a sign or the sign had gone and we ended up heading out to the South of the river. I was fairly sure that when we had done this route previously, we had been on the Northern bank. We probably should have gone back and checked but we kept going and assumed that at some point we would be able to cross the river and rejoin the route.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			This was a mistake! It was hard going on the Southern side as the cycle route was not signposted and we had to keep stopping to check directions. We were a bit unlucky in just missing the point we could have got back over the river and eventually gave up and began our return to Regensburg. During the journey back, we stopped for a break by a lake and booked a night at the same Ibis that we stayed in during the 2006 World Cup. We did find our way over the river on the return journey and re-entered Regensburg on the correct route. We arrived at the hotel at about 5pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we arrived at the hotel hot, tired and de-hydrated. We had quick showers and resisting the temptation to go straight to sleep, went out for a look around the old town. We walked past the cathedral and crossed the stone bridge to the Spital Brewery Beer Garden on the other side of the river. We had a couple of beers here and also decided to eat as we had not had much all day and were both hungry.

			We walked back into the old town after eating and went to find the hotel we had stayed in with Dave in 2003. We had another beer in the restaurant just over the road from the hotel, a place we have eaten in a few times before, and then walked back to the Ibis for another early night.

			Regensburg -> Straubing - 35.28 miles - 419 ft
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided yesterday that instead of getting the train directly to Munich this morning, we would continue cycling along the Danube, have another attempt to get to Straubing and get the train from there. This time we were more successful!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the hotel before 8:00, headed North over the river, crossed the Regen and were back on the Donauradweg just after 8:00. We stopped at Donaustauf for breakfast and then continued for another 28 miles or so to Straubing. There were a few places where the signs were confusing but once again, this was an easy ride mainly on tarmacked cycle paths. We finally arrived in Straubing at about 11:40.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We stopped briefly in the town centre for a few photos and then made our way to the train station. We bought an all day Bayern ticket (€32 for both of us) and waited for the 12:27 train to Landshut. We got on another train from there direct to Munich at Landshut (had to pay another €12 for bike tickets) and arrived at Munich Hbf at 14:15. We cycled the short distance back to the Hampton By Hilton, the same hotel we stayed in last year and checked in for two nights.

			We left the hotel at about 3:30 and started to walk towards town. We had been through a few different plans for today's drinking but ended up heading directly to the Augustiner Keller about 10 minutes away. There was a bit of faffing around to get in but once inside, it was as good as ever. We had three rounds in there before continuing towards the centre. We stopped for a few in the Augustiner Stammhaus and then walked to the tap room of the Nurnburg sausage house. Things are starting to get a bit vague from here! We had not had much to eat today and certainly not enough food for the amount of beer we were consuming.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We went to the Schneider Bräuhaus for one more drink but did not make it to the Hofbrauhaus, apparently deciding it was time to get the S-Bahn home instead.

		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 17th September</span>
			After somehow managing to eat breakfast in the hotel next door to ours, we went out on our bikes at about 11:00. We did not go far but went out to look around the Olympic stadium and then the Nymphenberg Palace before cycling to the Hirschgarten for our first beers of the day. We have not been here for a few years but it is another very good place to drink.

We had one in there, one in the Botanical Gardens and another in Augustiner Stammhaus before going to the Nurnberg sausage house where we had reserved a table for 6pm. After eating our sausages, we had a couple more at Schnider Weisse and this time did make to the Hofbrauhaus. Don't remember getting the S-Bahn home!

We bought tickets for ourselves and the bikes this time and waited for the 11:34 train back to Neu Ulm. It was a direct train all the way back although we did have to change compartments at Augsberg where the train split in two.

We had an hour or so sorting our stuff out in the room and then went out on our bikes again. We went into Ulm for lunch at Nordsee and then went about 8 or 9 miles in the opposite direction along The Danube. On returning to Neu Ulm, we went for a beer at the new Barfüßer Biergarten im Glacis. This was OK but not as nice as their old place had been last year. We had one in there and returned to the room for showers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We walked back into Ulm in the evening. We stopped for a couple of beers at Bier-Akademie as we got to the old town. This was the first place we have been to in Germany where there did not seem to be any covid-19 precautions. It was packed with students, there was no track & trace details taken and no hand sanitiser anywhere to be seen. We were sat outside so it did not really matter but we would not have wanted to spend too much time inside.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had reserved a table back at Barfüßer die Hausbrauerei for 8:15 and spent a very enjoyable few hours in there before walking back, managing to resist the temptation of Post Horn. A relatively sober night after the last couple.

		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 19th September</span>
			We were up by 9 and cycled into Ulm for breakfast in our "usual" cafe by the cathedral. We cycled back via the wibbly wobbly hotel (Hotel Schiefes Haus) that we had stayed in back in 2003, attached the bikes to the car and were on our way out of Neu Ulm by about 10:30. The journey was a bit slow as we had to go all the way back through the same sets of road-works that we had been through eight days ago but we had made it to the outskirts of Heidelberg by about 1:30.

        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once inside, the apartment was very nice and ideal for a couple of days. We had lunch on the small balcony and then spent a couple of hours inside watching the Swansea v Birmingham game on my tablet.

		<p class="diary-text">
			After the football had finished, we walked into the old town which starts about half a mile away from where we are staying. We were heading for a couple of breweries with a bit of sight-seeing along the way. We started walking along the main shopping street which goes through the old centre. This was totally packed with people which seemed quite strange after the other places we have been recently which have all been relatively empty. We had had enough of the crowds after a couple of blocks so headed down to the river and walked along there instead.

We walked from there through the main square to Vetter's Alt Heidelberger Brauhaus, or the braustube next door to the brewery to be precise. This was another very good place where we both tried the dark wheat beer, also superb. We stopped at a couple more smaller places on our walk back to the apartment. We had not eaten so bought a kebab on the way and then spent an hour or so joining in the weekly video call.

We did not pay to go into the castle but spent an hour or so walking round the gardens from where the views looking down on Heidelberg were superb.

			We walked back down from the castle and then cycled 12km to Schwetzingen. Here there was another castle that we did not bother going into but it was a nice little town to wander around.

We stopped at three more bars on the way back and also stopped at one of the places we were last night to buy a couple of the stone Franziskaner wheat beer "glasses" that we had had really liked.

			We ate breakfast on our balcony for the second morning in a row, loaded up the car and left the apartment just before 11. Apart from the room not being cleaned and a few problems with the key card, it had been a really good place to stay for a couple of days. We drove first to Schwetzingen where we had been yesterday. Roz had seen a hedgehog (or igel) family in a shop window when we walked around the town and she was keen to buy it as a souvenir. From Schwetzingen we had a drive of about 200 miles to get back to Aachen. Traffic moved a bit quicker today. We had a stop at a picnic area for lunch and arrived at the Ibis that we had stayed in 20 years ago at just after 3pm. After quick showers, it was out for our final session of the trip.

			First stop was Hopfen+Malz Beer Shop which was on our way into the old town. We just had one in there before moving on to Wirtshaus am Hühnerdieb. We also just had one there but noticed that Monday was "Schnitzel day". We decided that we would come back later to eat. We walked up to Zum goldenen Einhorn, still one of our favourite pubs in Germany for a few before returning to the Wirtshaus for excellent schitzels for under €10 each.

            We finished the night off by drinking rather more than planned in the small bar attached to the Aachener Brauhaus which is fast becoming another of our favourite pubs in Germany. We were bought rounds of drinks by the locals as the barman recognised us from our last visit and made it out of there after buying a round back sometime around 10pm. Back in the hotel by about 10:15.

			We were up by 8ish and left the hotel by about 8:30. We were not too badly hungover considering what we have drunk in the last few days which was just as well as we had to drive all the way home. We stopped at a supermarket for more beer and wine as well as food for the journey and then another stop for petrol before leaving Germany to drive through Belgium and France back to Calais. A relatively straight forward, uneventful journey all round. We got on the 13:50 train through the channel, were in Folkestone by 13:25 and back in Kingsclere by 15:30.
