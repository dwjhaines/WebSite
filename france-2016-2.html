                <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th June </span>Not a great start to the second part of my trip! After three days back in the office, I had booked a taxi for 16:05 so I could catch the 16:20 from Thatcham. It had not turned up by 16:12 and after phoning the taxi company, I was told it had been there but had left again. It had not been there but there was not a lot of point in arguing. I walked down to the bus stop on the A4 and waited for the 4:30 bus which would have meant I would have caught the 16:57 but the bus also failed to turn up. This meant a hot walk/jog of about 2.5 miles and I eventually got the 17:19 train. I did have an hour to spare but was not expecting it to be used up so early in the journey!
                </p>
                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-014.JPG"></div>
                <p class="diary-text">Things did get better after that. I got a quick connection in Reading and managed to get into Paddington at 18:15. I was in St Pancras by about 18:40, had time to buy my beer for the journey (four bottles max) and have a much needed pint in the Betjemen Arms. I checked in by 19:15 for the 20:01 train to be told that there was a 30 minute delay. I had a beer at the bar and drank one of my bottles while waiting. I had expected a lot of fans to be on the trian as Wales play N. Ireland in Paris tomorrow. There were a few around but not that many.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">The train eventually left at about 20:20 and arrived in Paris 35 minutes late just after mid-night. I checked into the Mercure right opposite the station that I had booked on the way home from Lyon. After dropping my bags in the room I went for a walk aroun the area outside the hotel but did not see any bar I fancied a drink in so called it a day.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 25th June </span>Today's journey did not start off too badly. I was awake before 7:00 and checked out of the hotel by about 7:20. It was only about a ten minute journey on the RER to get to Gare du Lyon and I arrived there with plenty of time to get the 8:37 down to Avignon where I was meeting Roz and Mark again.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">I bought breakfast at the station and got on the train which departed a few minutes late at about 8:45. The train was already running late due to having to detour round an area affected by storms last night but at 10:45 it stopped completely. The lights and air-con went out and after a while we were told that there was a problem with the electricity. After about an hour, everyone was allowed off the train and we all spent another hour or so stood by the side of the tracks. This was not as bad as being on the train as it was cooler and people were quite chattty abotu the football and Brexit. We were told that the electric had failed completely and we would ha to wait for another train to come and push us 5km to Macon. In total we were stationary for 2hrs 40 mins before the other train turned up and we could start moving again.
                </p>
                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-016.JPG"></div>
                <p class="diary-text">We got to Macon at just after 1:30 - 4 hrs 20 minutes behind scedule! We then waited about 50 minutes for the train to be detached. We had another 30 minute delay at Lyon while they habded out emergency tuna salads, water and colouring books. Although keen to get moving again, this was needed as my food and drink had long since run out. We eventually pulled into Avignon TGV and about 4:40, 5 hours 20 minutes late. I got another train for the five minute journey into the centre where I arrived just after 5:00.
            </p>
            
                <p class="diary-text">I had a ten minute walk to Place du Change where Roz and Mark were already watching the first game of the day in a bar. We stayed in there drinking Paulaner for the Wales v Northern Ireland game and were joined in there by Steve whose train was only delayed by just over an hour.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go back to the apartment at the end of the game but the barman bought us a round of drinks as we were about to leave. This was to prove to ave quite an effect on the rest of the evening. Instead of an hours break from the drinking, we carried on into the next game. We went to another couple of bars during the first half and then found a pizza restaurant for the second half. We were already fairly pissed when we went into the restaurant but managed to get through three litres of wine before we lwft. We then went to another bar (something I have no recollection of) before staggering back to the apartment in quite a mess at about 2am.

                <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 26th June </span>We were up by about 10:00 and left the apartment by 11:00. We had a two hour drive to Nice where play our next game and managed to find our hotel without too many problems. We were all felling either hungover or knackered by the time we arrived and there was not a lot of enthusiasm for going out to watch France v Ireland at 3:00. Instead, we watched the game in our rooms although I slept through a lot of it.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We met up in reception at 5:30 and walked into Nice old town which is a couple of miles away. We had an excellent meal in a Turkish restaurant while watching the first half of the Germany v Slovakia game and then went to a bar for the second half. By this time we were all flagging again and no-one was interested in staying out drinking any more. We went for a walk down to the sea front and then got the tram back to our hotel for an early night.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">Roz and I started watching the Belgium v Hungary game but could not stay awake so turned the TV off at half time.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 27th June - England v Iceland 
                </span>The worst performance we have ever seen from England!!!!
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">The day did not start off too badly. We had breakfast on the balcony of our room and gave Mark his birthday present. The four of us headed towards the old town just after 11:00. We stopped at the VEP (Voucher Exchange Point) which was on the way about 15 minutes walk from where we are staying. Collecting the tickets was surprisingly painless and we were on our way again after about five minutes.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We got to the old town and headed to the port area. We wandered round the port for a while and then found a bar/restaurant overlooking the port on the edge of the old town. We decided it was time for a beer and ended up eating there as well. It was a nice location with cool breezes coming off the sea and was a very pleasent spot for a couple of hours.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We left there and continued walking round the sea front to the Promenade Anglais. We spent a bit of time there before cutting back into the old town again. We wandered round there looking for bars but most places were either closed or quite restauranty. We found one place for a quick drink but then started walking towards the station. Mark and Steve wanted to pick up train tickets from there and that was also the departure point for the shuttles buses. We had hoped to find somewhere for a drink on the way but did not really find anything suitable. We ended up spending a couple of hours in a bar opposite the station which was OK. It was air conditioned, had Belgium beer and although crowded, the service was good. A bit overpriced but the best we could find.
                </p>
                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-018.JPG"></div>
                <p class="diary-text">We had heard a lot of people saying that getting to and from the ground was a bit of a nightmare. The ground is 10km out of town with no public transport apart from shuttle buses from the station. Despite the kick-off not being until 9:00, we left the bar at 6:40 and started making our way to the grounnd. The queues for the buses were not too bad and the journey only took abotu half an hour. The buses dropped everyone about 2km from the ground so we had a 30 - 40 minute walk before we started on security checks. Because we were there earlier than usual, getting in was quite easy and we were in our seats about an our before kick-off.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">Enough has already been written about the game but it really was abysmal. England were totally shit and deserved to get beaten. By far the worst performance any of us have ever seen from an England side that should have won easily. It was a terrible way to go out of the tournament and something that none of us had expected.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We got out of the ground as soon as possible after the game and although there was a lack of organisation at the bus queues, we were on a bus fairly quickly and back in Nice before midnight. We had a walk of a couple of miles to get back to the hotel and stopped for a final beer on the way. None of us could relaly believe what we had just seen. Mark had already decided that this would be his last tournament and that he is "retiring" from internatinal football. After what we had seen tonight and with all the hassle involved in following England, the rest of us were just about in agreement.
