                <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th June </span>Not a great start to the second part of my trip! After three days back in the office, I had booked a taxi for 16:05 so I could catch the 16:20 from Thatcham. It had not turned up by 16:12 and after phoning the taxi company, I was told it had been there but had left again. It had not been there but there was not a lot of point in arguing. I walked down to the bus stop on the A4 and waited for the 4:30 bus which would have meant I would have caught the 16:57 but the bus also failed to turn up. This meant a hot walk/jog of about 2.5 miles and I eventually got the 17:19 train. I did have an hour to spare but was not expecting it to be used up so early in the journey!

                <p class="diary-text">Things did get better after that. I got a quick connection in Reading and managed to get into Paddington at 18:15. I was in St Pancras by about 18:40, had time to buy my beer for the journey (four bottles max) and have a much needed pint in the Betjemen Arms. I checked in by 19:15 for the 20:01 train to be told that there was a 30 minute delay. I had a beer at the bar and drank one of my bottles while waiting. I had expected a lot of fans to be on the trian as Wales play N. Ireland in Paris tomorrow. There were a few around but not that many.

                <p class="diary-text">The train eventually left at about 20:20 and arrived in Paris 35 minutes late just after mid-night. I checked into the Mercure right opposite the station that I had booked on the way home from Lyon. After dropping my bags in the room I went for a walk aroun the area outside the hotel but did not see any bar I fancied a drink in so called it a day.
