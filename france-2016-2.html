                <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th June </span>Not a great start to the second part of my trip! After three days back in the office, I had booked a taxi for 16:05 so I could catch the 16:20 from Thatcham. It had not turned up by 16:12 and after phoning the taxi company, I was told it had been there but had left again. It had not been there but there was not a lot of point in arguing. I walked down to the bus stop on the A4 and waited for the 4:30 bus which would have meant I would have caught the 16:57 but the bus also failed to turn up. This meant a hot walk/jog of about 2.5 miles and I eventually got the 17:19 train. I did have an hour to spare but was not expecting it to be used up so early in the journey!
                </p>
                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-014.JPG"></div>
                <p class="diary-text">Things did get better after that. I got a quick connection in Reading and managed to get into Paddington at 18:15. I was in St Pancras by about 18:40, had time to buy my beer for the journey (four bottles max) and have a much needed pint in the Betjemen Arms. I checked in by 19:15 for the 20:01 train to be told that there was a 30 minute delay. I had a beer at the bar and drank one of my bottles while waiting. I had expected a lot of fans to be on the trian as Wales play N. Ireland in Paris tomorrow. There were a few around but not that many.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">The train eventually left at about 20:20 and arrived in Paris 35 minutes late just after mid-night. I checked into the Mercure right opposite the station that I had booked on the way home from Lyon. After dropping my bags in the room I went for a walk aroun the area outside the hotel but did not see any bar I fancied a drink in so called it a day.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 25th June </span>Today's journey did not start off too badly. I was awake before 7:00 and checked out of the hotel by about 7:20. It was only about a ten minute journey on the RER to get to Gare du Lyon and I arrived there with plenty of time to get the 8:37 down to Avignon where I was meeting Roz and Mark again.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">I bought breakfast at the station and got on the train which departed a few minutes late at about 8:45. The train was already running late due to having to detour round an area affected by storms last night but at 10:45 it stopped completely. The lights and air-con went out and after a while we were told that there was a problem with the electricity. After about an hour, everyone was allowed off the train and we all spent another hour or so stood by the side of the tracks. This was not as bad as being on the train as it was cooler and people were quite chattty abotu the football and Brexit. We were told that the electric had failed completely and we would ha to wait for another train to come and push us 5km to Macon. In total we were stationary for 2hrs 40 mins before the other train turned up and we could start moving again.
                </p>
                <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-016.JPG"></div>
                <p class="diary-text">We got to Macon at just after 1:30 - 4 hrs 20 minutes behind scedule! We then waited about 50 minutes for the train to be detached. We had another 30 minute delay at Lyon while they habded out emergency tuna salads, water and colouring books. Although keen to get moving again, this was needed as my food and drink had long since run out. We eventually pulled into Avignon TGV and about 4:40, 5 hours 20 minutes late. I got another train for the five minute journey into the centre where I arrived just after 5:00.
            </p>
            
                <p class="diary-text">I had a ten minute walk to Place du Change where Roz and Mark were already watching the first game of the day in a bar. We stayed in there drinking Paulaner for the Wales v Northern Ireland game and were joined in there by Steve whose train was only delayed by just over an hour.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go back to the apartment at the end of the game but the barman bought us a round of drinks as we were about to leave. This was to prove to ave quite an effect on the rest of the evening. Instead of an hours break from the drinking, we carried on into the next game. We went to another couple of bars during the first half and then found a pizza restaurant for the second half. We were already fairly pissed when we went into the restaurant but managed to get through three litres of wine before we lwft. We then went to another bar (something I have no recollection of) before staggering back to the apartment in quite a mess at about 2am.

                <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 26th June </span>We were up by about 10:00 and left the apartment by 11:00. We had a two hour drive to Nice where play our next game and managed to find our hotel without too many problems. We were all felling either hungover or knackered by the time we arrived and there was not a lot of enthusiasm for going out to watch France v Ireland at 3:00. Instead, we watched the game in our rooms although I slept through a lot of it.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">We met up in reception at 5:30 and walked into Nice old town which is a couple of miles away. We had an excellent meal in a Turkish restaurant while watching the first half of the Germany v Slovakia game and then went to a bar for the second half. By this time we were all flagging again and no-one was interested in staying out drinking any more. We went for a walk down to the sea front and then got the tram back to our hotel for an early night.
