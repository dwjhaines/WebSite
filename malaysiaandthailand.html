              This trip was supposed to be when we finally got to go back to Mabul and Sipidan. We had paid the deposit for our diving at the start of the pandemic and moved the trip several times due to lockdowns and then my lung issues in 2022. However, we found out a couple of weeks ago that my lungs are not fully healed and I am unlikely to be able to dive ever again meaning another change of plan. We decided to put off Mabul until the end of the year but still have the four week holiday to Malaysia and Thailand. We cancelled our flights to Tawau and used the refunds to book flights to Langkawi instead. Our possible dive trip to Phi Phi in the middle of our stay in Thailand has been replaced with a few days in Bangkok and we have extended our stay in the nice hotel in Nai Yang by an extra day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Still a bit sad about the diving but not too bad a holiday!

              We left Kingsclere on the 2 o'clock bus into Basingstoke (Going to Heathrow by bus and train was about half the price of parking the car for four weeks). We caught the 2:36 train to Clapham Junction and spent a couple of hours in the Wetherspoons there. We got another train to Feltham, had one in our second Wetherspoons of the day and then got the bus into Terminal 4.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The terminal was fairly empty and we checked in and got through security pretty quickly. We had one more drink in the bar that used to be a Wetherspoons and boarded the 21:25 Malaysian Airlines flight to KL.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The flight was very enjoyable. They were quite generous with the alcohol compared to some Malaysian Airlines flights we have been on. We had quite a few glasses of wine with our meals and while watching films. Although the flight was full, we also managed to get quite a bit of sleep.

              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 16th January</span>
              We were woken for breakfast at about 3pm Malaysian time and landed an hour and a half earlier than we had been expecting to at 5pm. However, the hour and a half that we had gained was taken away from us again as we had to queue for almost two hours to get through immigration. We have never liked KLIA and our opinion of it did not improve at all today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Once through immigration, things did improve. We picked up our luggage and got straight onto a shuttle bus to KLIA2 where we had booked a night at the Tune Hotel. We had stayed here a few times on the 2018/19 World trip as it is very handy for KLIA2. We were checked in just after 7:30 and after showers, returned to the terminal to eat. The curry place we have eaten in a few times had changed a bit but the food was still as good and we were able to have our first roti canai of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We both went for a bit of a walk round the shopping centre after eating and I carried on walking until I had done my steps for the day. We were both worn out by this point so had an alcohol free night and were in bed by 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 17th January</span>
              We were awake at 7:15 after a pretty good nights sleep and went straight down for breakfast. We had breakfast included with the room here for the first time. It was pretty good despite the lack of roti canai. We returned to the room, packed our bags and checked out of the hotel. We walked into the terminal and checked my bag in for the 10:20 Air Asia flight to Langkawi. We went back into the shopping centre so that Roz could buy a Malaysian SIM card and then went to wait at the gate for our flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The flight left slightly early and we were in Langkawi by 11:30. We were through the airport fairly quickly and got a taxi to the Mercure Hotel at Cenang beach where we have a room booked for the next five nights. We had a bit of waiting around at reception for our room to be ready but were in it by about 12:45. Due to Roz's gold membership, we were upgraded again and have a very nice room with balcony leading out to the pool. We dropped our bags and went out to have a look round Cenang.

              We had been to Cenang in 1990 with Dave but had got bored after one night at the beach as there was nothing here. Things have changed a bit since then and it is completely unrecognisable compared to when we were here last. There are now plenty of restaurants and shops.... and in particular duty free shops. We walked to the Northern end of the shops to get roti canai for lunch, had a quick look at the beach and then walked back buying a litre of Bacardi on the way. Although the alcohol was not quite as cheap as when we were here 33 years ago, Bacardi was Â£10 a litre so not too expensive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Back at the hotel we had an hour or so by the pool. It does not get much sun after about 3pm so I gave up after a while and returned to the room to catch up on sleep. I went out for a walk along the beach just before 5 to complete my steps for the day while Roz swam in the pool.
            </p>

              We started drinking at 6:45. We collected our welcome drinks from the bar and had them on our balcony along with a few Bacardi and cokes. We went out to eat at 8ish. Despite being a duty free island, most of the restaurants here do not serve alcohol, particularly not the Indian ones. We found an Italian/Mexican place (Viva Italia) that did have alcoholic drinks and ate there. The pizzas were not too authentic but were very good, as were the cocktails. After eating, we stopped for a couple more drinks at Cinnamons Bar before returning to the balcony to continue drinking the Bacardi.

              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 18th January</span>
              A lazy day of not doing much. We made it to the pool by about midday and stayed for a couple of hours. We returned to the same restaurant as yesterday for lunch before returning to the room for an hour or so. At 4ish I walked to the end of the next beach from Cenang - Tengah Beach but that was about it for todays activity.

              It was a night off alcohol tonight so after a quick walk on the beach to look at the sunset, we were able to eat at one of the Indian restaurants. We had excellent meals and were back in the room just after 9:00.

              <span class="diary-date">Friday 19th January</span>
              We were up earlier today so were able to go for breakfast at our usual lunch restaurant. When we got back from breakfast, we extended our stay here for another couple of nights. We had planned on leaving Langkawi on Monday and visiting the Cameron Highlands for two nights. However, we are both quite content here and had decided that we would rather stay where we are. We have an upgraded room here which is very good value and we were able to book a cheaper room for a couple of nights and get the same upgrade. All done very efficiently!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We spent the remainder of the morning by the pool although I stayed mainly in the shade due to burning yesterday. We ate lunch at a Middle Eastern restaurant for a change, bought another litre of Bacardi and then spent a hour or so in the room. I went out for a walk along Cenang beach again at 4.

              We had a similar evening to the one two nights ago. We started with drinks on the balcony then returned to the Italian/Mexican restaurant. We had seen people eating Indian food in there when we were here last and discovered that they would bring food from the Indian restaurant that was upstairs. We had a couple of curries with cocktails and wine, stopped for a couple in Cinnamons Bar and returned to the hotel for more drinks on the balcony.

              I was awake by 11 and went out for a walk for an hour or so. We spent another hour or so by the pool before going out for more chicken shawarma for lunch. We walked down to the next beach again after eating and then returned to the hotel.

              The evening was very much the same as last night. Drinks on the balcony, Indian food at Viva Italia with a few cocktails, just the one drink each in Cinnamons and back to the balcony to finish the Bacardi. Another enjoyable night out.

              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 21st January</span>
              A typical Sunday spent not doing a lot. We did not make it out of bed until about midday. I went to get banana shakes for breakfast and Roz went and bought chicken shawarmas for lunch but most of the day was spent reading by the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              It was another alcohol free night so we returned to India Royale for another very good Indian meal. We had a visit to the duty free shop to buy Bacardi and wine for tomorrow and were back in the hotel before 9 again.

              We managed to do quite a bit more today than yesterday. There were not too many sights on Langkawi that we we keen to see but we both wanted to go up Langkawi Skybridge Cable Car and hiring a car seemed to be the best way of getting there. We left the hotel just after 8:00 and went across the road to Ali's Bistro for our first roti chanai for a couple of days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had asked a few people about hire cars and the prices did not seem too expensive. We returned to a place we had inquired at last night and they sent us over the road where we were offered the cheapest price yet. The car was small old and not in very good condition but it seemed to all be working and was only MR60 (just over Â£10) for the day. We never really established what the insurance situation was but we were not planning on going far so handed over our money and headed off for the day just after 9.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              First of all, we drove into the island's capitol, Kuah. We had stayed here with Dave 33 years ago but could not find anything we recognised. We parked near the ferry terminal and walked up to Eagle Square for photos of the giant eagle and views of the Maha Tower
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We continued walking to the terminal and bought tickets for the 1pm ferry back to the mainland on Wednesday. We returned to the car and drove to the Air Terjun waterfall. This was a bit of a disappointment as it was a hot climb up to the viewing platform and there was not a lot of water there due to it being the dry season. We walked back down to the pools that you can bathe in but these did not look too appealing either so we walked back down and drove to the base of the cable car.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had to walk through the "Oriental Village" to get the base. This was a bit crap but there were not too many people about so we were able to buy our tickets and get straight onto a cable car. This is one of the longest and steepest cable car rides in the world and was truly spectacular. We had excellent views of the island as we travelled up, a journey that lasted about 10 minutes.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had a look at the views from the intermediate stop and then continued across to the upper stop. We walked down from there to the "Sky Walk", a 125m bridge suspended from a single pylon. The bridge itself was spectacular and once again, the views were superb. After we had finished at the top we got the cable car back down again, had lunch from one of the shops at the bottom. We returned to Cenang and returned the hire car. As well as the MR60 we had spent on the car, we used MR20 worth of petrol so it had proved a very good value way of seeing what we wanted to on the island. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were back at the hotel by 4ish so were able to spend an hour or so by the pool before starting drinking again. We had planned a slightly different evening to normal but after a drink on the balcony, we were quite settled so had a few more before going out. We had thought about getting takeaways but returned to Viva Italia instead for our anniversary pizzas. We stopped for a couple of drinks at Cinnamons Bar and then it was back to the balcony for a few more.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 23rd January</span>
              We were up by 10:30 this morning so were able to get to Ali's Bistro again while they were still serving roti canai. We had an hour or so by the pool and then ate the remains of last nights pizza with banana shakes for lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The rest of the day was spent lazing around either by the pool or in the room. We went for a final walk along the beach in the evening before showers and another meal at India Royale.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 24th January</span>
              We went to Ali's Bistro again for breakfast and then lazed around the hotel until we checked out at 11:15. We had booked a taxi to take us to the ferry terminal and it turned up on time at 11:30. We were at the terminal 30 minutes later.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We realised today that we had probably booked ferry tickets to the wrong place. We had booked them to Kuala Perlis, the town that we came through 30 years ago but there are also ferries to Kuala Kedah which is a lot closer to Alor Setar where we are heading to for tonight. As it was, it did not make too much difference. Our ferry left at the same time as the other one at 1pm. The ferry journey was shorter and cheaper than the other one and the 45 minute taxi ride from Kuala Perlis to Alor Setar only cost MR65. We were dropped at The Jerai Hotel in Alor Setar at about 3:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After checking in, we dropped our bags and walked to the train station, about 10 minutes away. We were hoping to buy tickets to Ipoh for tomorrow and from Ipoh back to KL for Friday. However when we got to the station we found all the Inter City trains are full. We are not sure what is going on but the ferries were full today and there seems to be a lot of people moving around. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We decided that we would try and get on one of the "commuter trains" tomorrow. This will involve a change and is a journey of about three hours. We then went for a drink and managed to book a bus from Ipoh to KLIA2 for Friday afternoon. Not totally ideal but should all be OK and we get back to the airport at a good time.

              Once this was sorted, we went off to do our sightseeing. There are only a couple of things we wanted to see here. We walked via the main square to the mosque which was quite nice without being overly exciting. People were praying at the time we got there so we did not attempt to go inside. We walked from there to the Alor Setar Tower, an 80m high communications tower with a few viewing platforms. We went up in the lift to the first of the platforms for good views of the area and back to Langkawi. We were back in the room by about 6:30.

              We went out again at 7:30. We knew that Alor Setar is a very strict Muslim area and we were not expecting to find a lot of bars but we also struggled to find any restaurants. I had looked up a few before going out but everywhere was  either closed or did not seem to exist at all any more. The only three restaurants we did find open were McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut, none of which particularly appealed. We eventually found a small place with tables in the street  called Man Utd Corner. There was a lot of confusion about what should have been a relatively simple order but we eventually were given a plate of mee goreng and another of nasi goreng both of which were surprisingly tasty. There was not too much else to see and do here so we were back in the room by about 8:30.

              We did discover that tomorrow is a public holiday in a lot of states in Malaysia which may have had an impact on the number of people travelling around. It may also have an impact on the availability of commuter trains but tickets for these can not be bought until the day of travel so we can not do a lot about that until tomorrow!

              We went down for breakfast at 8 and then walked straight back to the train station. We wanted to confirm that the commuter trains were running and to buy tickets before walking there with our luggage. We got tickets for the 11:18 train without any problems and walked back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We killed an hour or so in the hotel room and then checked out and returned to the station with our luggage. We were on the platform by 10:50, about half an hour before the scheduled departure. The platform was getting quite busy as we waited and it was obvious that the train was going to be full. It turned up a couple of minutes late and although full, we were both able to get seats. Just after an hour, we had to change trains at Bukit Mertajam. We only had a few minutes connection time but the second train waited and we all just got on. The second train was more crowded and I had to stand for the first hour but it was not too bad. Although the commuter trains were not as good as the inter city ones, they did the 250km journey fairly quickly and we arrived in Ipoh a few minutes early at 14:10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked a room at the Kinta Riverview Hotel which was not far from the station. We walked straight there and arrived about 15 minutes later in a horribly sweaty mess. We checked into a slightly dated but otherwise very nice room with views of the river. After crisps and biscuits for lunch, we were getting ready to go to the pool for an hour when we saw dark clouds coming our way. Within about 10 minutes, this turned into a tropical thunderstorm  which lasted for the rest of the afternoon so the pool was knocked on the head.

              We had planned to go out and see the sights at 5 but the rain showed no sign of easing. We had planned to have a few drinks tonight so at about 6:30 we had a Bacardi and coke while watching the rain. We had decided that it was too wet to walk into the old town despite it being about half a mile away. I downloaded the "Grab" app and ordered a taxi through that. Although the taxi journey probably took longer than if we had walked, it only cost MR5 and saved us from getting wet.

              Ipoh is a bit less conservative than Alor Setar and there are a few beer bars in the old town. We were dropped outside Beer Teller Cafe. This was an Indian run place and was closed for whatever Hindu festival has caused the public holiday. It was still raining but it was only a short walk to The Miners Arms, a supposedly English type pub just down the road. This was not too bad an option. It was air-conditioned, served Franziskaner wheat beer and did very good food. A slightly more expensive meal than last night but worth the extra money.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After an enjoyable couple of hours in there, the rain had eased sufficiently for us to walk back to the hotel where we finished the remainder of the duty free Bacardi.

              Ipoh is another place that does not have a huge selection of spectacular sights but it is pleasant enough wandering round the old town looking at the colonial buildings and murals. We were back in the hotel by about 10:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were booked onto the 16:00 bus to KLIA2 from Terminal Amanjaya, about 8km out of town. We checked out of the hotel at midday and, due to the improvement in the weather, were able to go and spend a couple of hours by the pool. At about 2:30, we ordered another "Grab" taxi and were in the bus terminal before 3. We collected our boarding passes, bought a few provisions for the journey leaving us with about an hour sitting around waiting. The bus left on time and was very comfortable. After all the transport being totally fully booked the last couple of days, there were only us and five other passengers on this bus. We had one toilet stop just before KL and were dropped at KLIA2 at 19:50. We walked to the Tune Hotel and checked in for the second time on this trip.

              Neither of us were too hot and sweaty after what had been a fairly easy journey so we were able to go straight out and eat at our usual Indian restaurant. We had a quick walk round the shopping centre and were back in the room just after 9.

              We had breakfast included with the room again and apart from a quick walk round the shopping centre, did not do a lot until we checked out at 10:00. We walked across to the terminal, checked in our luggage and went through immigration. All a lot quicker than going the other way! We made our way to the gate and had a wait of about 90 minutes for our flight to Phuket.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The 12:25 Air Asia flight left on time and was in Phuket by about 1pm local time. Immigration was a lot quicker than in KL and our bags were there by the time we came through. The airport was as chaotic as ever but we came out and walked to the road round to Nai Yang beach. We did not really want to walk to Nai Yang Beach Resort but as usual in Phuket, the taxis were ridiculously expensive. Even Grab was offering us taxis for nearly Â£10 for the 1.5 mile journey. We started walking but after about 200m, someone did stop and would take us for à¸¿150. Still too much but a more reasonable price and we still have bad memories of walking it in the midday heat a few years ago!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We got to the resort just after 2pm. Our room was not ready so we had banana shakes and then sat by the pool until it was. By 3 we had settled in. Not the best balcony we have had here but the room is still nice enough. No turtle pens, notepads or toiletries for Roz to steal and no longer any tortoises for Roz to feed, but everything else is fairly similar to when we were here last five years ago. After an hour or so at the pool, I went off to buy provisions for tonight. Tesco was no longer where it used to be but there are a lot more shops around than when we first started coming here and the shops near where we are staying are about as cheap anyway. I bought crisps, nuts, water and Sang Som and then went back out with Roz for a look at the beach and to buy the coke and beer.

              We returned to the room for showers and started drinking at 7. It was a typical Thai session. We started with drinks on the balcony and went out to eat just after 8. The restaurants have changed a bit since last time but on our walk earlier, we had found a place at the Southern end of Nai Yang where you could still sit on the beach eating with your own bottles of Sang Som. The food was pretty good and it was a very enjoyable evening. We returned to the balcony to watch the second half of Sunderland v Stoke and don't remember too much about anything after that had finished.

We went over the road to get takeaway banana shakes and fried rice for lunch and returned to the pool later in the afternoon. At 4:30ish I went for a walk around the National Park and Roz went for a swim in the sea.

              We had our third session in a row this evening. The restaurant we had eaten in the last two nights was closed but we ate at the restaurant that used to be Sunset - now called Rotcharin Seafood. Apart from that, the evening was the same as the last two!

              After breakfast, we had an hour or so by the pool, returned to the room for showers and checked out of the resort by 11:30. We left most of our luggage with reception as we will be back in five days time. We had a taxi booked for 11:30 and were at the airport ten minutes later. We got through all security without any problems and by midday, we were sat waiting for the 13:20 Air Asia flight to Don Muang. The flight left on time and we landed in Bangkok just before 3pm.

              We walked straight out of the airport and were pleased to see that there were no long queues for taxis. Our taxi driver never really got to grips with our hotel but he understood MBK which is just over the road from The Mercure where we will be for the next five nights. We checked in and were given an upgraded room again. I don't think the room itself is much of an upgrade this time but it is on the 28th floor with excellent views of the Siam Square area (and the MBK shopping centre!).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We unpacked what luggage we did have and went straight out to have a look around the area. We have stayed in this part of Bangkok many times before but we were keen to find out what had changed. The first place we went to check was Feat Lab, the beer bar we had got very drunk in at Christmas five years ago. This was still in the same place and had not changed at all. We walked from there to Siam Sqaure to find that Ban Khun Mae had disappeared completely. This has always been our favourite restaurant in Bangkok and one of our favourites anywhere in the world so this was a big disappointment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We walked back to the hotel stopping at the MBK to buy Roz a SIM card and at 7-11 (now in the same building as the hotel) for provisions for tonight.

              Back in the hotel, we discovered that Ban Khun Mae had moved to inside the MBK. Not an ideal move but at least it still exists and is now closer to where we are staying. We had a couple of drinks while looking at our view and then went out to eat. It took a while to find the restaurant but we got there eventually. The location was nowhere near as nice as it used to be - it is after all in shopping centre - but we got a reasonable table and the food was still good. We had a bottle of Sang Som with the meal and then returned to the hotel bar. We had our welcome drinks and sat outside while drinking another bottle of Sang Som.

After a bit of a walk round Siam square, it was back to the pool for the afternoon. I made it to the gym at about 4:30. It was all a bit of an effort after the last couple of weeks but I did manage to run 3.8km.

This always comes up as one of the main sights in Bangkok but I had never realised that it was so close to the area we were staying i.e. about a five minute walk. We had to book ourselves on a 45 minute tour to be able to look round the buildings. All reasonably interesting without being the most exciting place we have ever visited.

This was quite a bizarre place with a lot going on. Again all quite interesting to see but not too spectacular. We walked back from the shrine to the MBK where we were able to get a table inside without having to queue. We had an excellent meal again before returning to the hotel for a quieter night than the last couple.

              We were up reasonably early this morning and went straight out to continue our sight-seeing. We walked round to the pier and got a boat along the canal towards the Grand Palace. We got off at the last stop and went first to the Golden Mount. This is a temple that we could see from the roof of our hotel but have never visited. It is relatively small with not too many tourists but was nice enough to walk round even if we could not get to the very top due to maintenance work.

              We stopped for breakfast and then started walking towards the Grand Palace. The walk was one of the highlights of the morning as it took us along a street lined with shops selling Buddha statues and other paraphernalia that adorns Buddhist temples. When we did get to the Grand Palace, we found that we could not go in wearing the shorts we were wearing despite them being long enough for the previous temple. In the past you had been able to borrow sarongs to get round this issue but now they insist on you buying skirts/long trousers for à¸¿200 each. This together with the large numbers of tourists around put us off and after a bit of dithering, we decided to give it a miss.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              This did not work out too badly. We also wanted to go and see the Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho. This is a complex of temples just South of the grounds of the Grand Palace that we had not visited before whereas we have been to the Grand Palace a couple of times. There were less tourists, it was cheaper to get in and there were no problems with how we were dressed. The huge reclining Buddha was very impressive and the rows of golden Buddha images were all very photogenic as was most of the rest of the compound. Away from the main parts the number of tourists dropped even more and it was a very pleasant place to wander round. After the Reclining Buddha, we spent an hour or so in the rest of the compound before we decided that we had seen enough Buddhas and chedi and it was time to start heading back to the hotel.

The Chao Phraya service seemed to have changed its stopping points and the changes don't seem to have made it onto Google Maps yet. After getting another ferry back to where we started, we decided to give up on boats. We walked to the nearest metro station, got the metro to Silom and then the BTS back to National Stadium.

We drank our one remaining beer in the room before going out just after 5. We got the BTS to Nana, walked to Soi 13 and made our way towards Sportsman Bar. Just before the bar, we found The German Beer House so stopped in there for a couple of wheat beers.

We were told to go upstairs and were taken to a room with a big screen that was showing the Sunderland game. It was not a bad place to watch the game. They sold Brewdog beers and there were a few other people watching so there was a bit of an atmosphere. We ate during the second half.

              After the game, we returned to the German place where we watched Chelsea v Wolves with a few more wheat beers. When this finished, we got a taxi back to the hotel and finished the end of our Sang Som before bed.

              We had a final breakfast in the MBK and checked out of the hotel at midday. We had been unsure about whether five nights was too long to stay in Bangkok but we have both really enjoyed our stay here and the time has gone very quickly. It did help that the hotel was probably the nicest we have had in Bangkok with excellent views and a good pool area. The food has been excellent again and we have had very good nights out here.

              We left the hotel and got a taxi driver that was prepared to use the meter at the fourth attempt. We were at Don Muang by about 1pm. We were booked onto the 14:20 Air Asia flight back to Phuket. When we got to the airport, we were told that it was 15 minutes late and it eventually left at about 15:00. We landed in Phuket at about 4:30 and as we only had hand luggage, we did walk all the way to Nai Yang Beach Resort. As usual, we did not end up in the same type of room that we had booked but for the first time, were in on of the rooms near the back swimming pool. These have all been recently renovated so probably slightly better than the room we had last week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were both a bit hot by the time we checked in at 5:30 so spent 30 minutes or so by the pool to cool down. We were having a night off alcohol tonight. We ate at Rotcharin Seafood again and were back in the room by 9.

              At 9ish, I collected my rucksack from reception and took it along to Dewa Resort where we will be spending the next four nights. I walked out to the main road to buy breakfast which we ate on the balcony. We had an hour or so by the pool before checking out of Nai Yang Beach Resort at midday.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had a 10 minute walk back to Dewa Resort. This place is a bit more upmarket than the places we usually stay but we had booked it for three days for Roz's 60th birthday. We were due to arrive tomorrow but when we found out that I could not dive, we extended our stay to four days. We had booked a package for a "Grand Pool Villa". Our room was not ready when we arrived but we were able to check in, install the Dewa app and were told that we would be notified when the room was ready. All a bit different from some hotel check-ins we have had in Thailand!

              We booked our floating breakfast and massage for tomorrow (both included in the package) and went to lie by the pool while we waited. We found out at 1:40 that the room was ready and were shown to our "villa". The room is superb. It is in its own walled off garden with a small pool. It has a huge indoor seating area with access straight into the pool, all in front of a large four-poster bed. On the bed was a pile of towels in the shape of a birthday cake with a sign saying "Happy Birthday". Not long after we were in the room, Roz was bought a piece of birthday cake. We think they have got the date wrong because of us booking the extra day but it was all very nice anyway. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We unpacked and sorted our stuff out, went out to buy provisions and spent the rest of the afternoon eating the cake and lazing about in or around our pool. A very enjoyable few hours.

              In the evening, Roz went for a manicure/pedicure giving me the chance to wrap up her presents for tomorrow. We had planned to have another alcohol free night again but when we went to the bar to claim our free mocktails (also included in the package) the barman was happy to give us pina coladas. We drank those and walked back to Bank Seafood where we had a couple of glasses of wine with our meals. We stopped to buy more drinks for tomorrow night and were back in the room by 9:45.

              After Roz had opened her cards, we got up and waited for the floating breakfast that we had ordered for 8:30. This had not turned up by 8:50 so we went to reception to see what was happening. We decided we may as well go and join the normal breakfast and have the floating breakfast another day. The manager apologised for the "communication problem" and got four members of staff to sing Happy Birthday while presenting Roz with another piece of cake. The breakfast was excellent so not the end of the world.

              We had a couple of hours to kill before the next part of our package - the Thai Massage. Roz stayed by our pool while I went out and walked a couple of miles through the National Park. Our massage was booked for midday. We signed in and were given the option of a traditional Thai pressure massage or an oil massage which was à¸¿200 each more. We both chose the traditional massage with medium pressure and stretching. The massage seemed to alternate between being very relaxing and quite painful as pressure was put on various points of the body. All in all an enjoyable experience that we would happily repeat but we were both relieved that we had only asked for the medium and not the hard pressure massage!

              We returned to our room and spent most of the rest of the afternoon by the pool. Roz went out for more cake which we ate in the room and I went out for another short walk but we did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon. At 5 we had a video call with Jane. Just after 6, We had our first drinks of the day in the room while Roz opened her presents.

              From then on, it was a normal Thai session. We had a few more by the pool before walking to Rotcharin Seafood. We have just about agreed that this is the favourite of the two restaurants we have been eating at. We had another very good meal with plenty more Sang Som before finishing the evening with a couple more glasses by the pool.

              We went to breakfast just after 9 and did not do too much for the rest of the day. I did manage to go out out for a couple of walks. Firstly, after breakfast, I walked round the National Park and along the beach to get most of my steps out of the way early. I then went out to the 7-11 by the main road to replenish our beer and Sang Som supplies before they stopped selling alcohol at 2pm. Apart from that we spent the whole day in our villa.

              We had re-booked our floating breakfast for this morning and it turned up at 8:30. It was a large basket type thing that floated with a pretty good selection of food and drinks on it. We ate while sat in the pool. Not the sort of thing you need to do every day but it was an enjoyable way to start the day.

              After the excitement of breakfast, we returned to bed for an hour or so as both of us were feeling the effects of last night's alcohol. A bit of sleep seemed to sort us both out and I was able to go for a walk along the beach again by 11. Another afternoon of not doing a lot apart from lazing around the villa.

              We returned to a more normal breakfast this morning and then stayed in the villa until check-out time at midday. We checked out, and left our luggage in reception. Staying here has been brilliant. I had been unsure if we would think it was worth the price but it has been well worth it. Having our own pool has been very enjoyable and it really has been a lovely place to stay. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We have also thoroughly enjoyed Nai Yang again. Rotcharin Seafood is basically Sunset with a different name. The food has been excellent and I have enjoyed walking on the beach. There have been changes here but it is by no means over-developed yet.

              I went for a final walk along the beach before rejoining Roz at the pool. We stayed there until 2:30 and got transferred to the airport at 2:45. We had a bit of a queue to check-in but were able to check our luggage all the way through to LHR which was good news. Our 16:55 MAS flight back to KL left on time and arrived at about 19:30 local time. Thankfully the queues at immigration were a lot shorter than when we got here last month and we were through fairly quickly. Once through, we had a walk of about 10 minutes to the Sama Sama hotel where we checked in just before 8pm.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After showers, we walked back to the airport, or to be more precise, the airport bus station where there was a cheap Indian restaurant. We ate there then went into the airport to buy soft drinks to go with the two bottles of Sang Son that we had bought at Phuket airport. We returned to the room and drank the Sang Som while following the football. Sunderland and Swansea both won so it was an enjoyable end to the holiday.

              When the alarms went off at 6:30, staying up until 1am drinking Sang Som did not seem such a good idea. However, we were out of the hotel 15 minutes later and had enough time to stop for our final roti chanais before heading into the terminal. We already had our boarding passes so got through fairly quickly. There were no major queues at immigration so by 8ish, we were sat outside the gate waiting to board the 9:25 MAS flight to Heathrow.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We boarded on time but did not take off until about 10:30 for some reason. The flight was full but quite enjoyable again. We read or watched videos for the first half of the flight and then started drinking. We were in the very back row of the plane. As with the outward journey, the cabin crew were quite generous with the beer and wine. One of them in particular was topping up our glasses as soon as they were close to being empty so we were starting to get pissed by the time we landed. We landed at 4pm, had a bit of a wait for our luggage and were outside at the bus stops by about 5:30.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              There was a bit of confusion about the buses meaning that we had to change at Hatton Cross but by about 6pm we were checked in to the Ibis on the A4 again. We had showers and went down for our welcome drink then walked out to The Harlington Tandoori just round the corner. This was a slightly odd place but we had excellent curries with another bottle of wine.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were back at the hotel by 9:15 and both asleep about two minutes after getting into the room

              We were both awake early but had had a good nights sleep. We could not get on any trains before 9:30 so walked to the Tesco about a mile away along the A4 and bought meal deals to take back to the room for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We checked out at about 8:45 and got a bus to Feltham station. We were quite lucky with our train connections after that. We got the 9:35 to Clapham Junction and had a wait of about 2 minutes for a fast train back to Basingstoke. We arrived in Basingstoke at 11:40 and were just able to get the 11:44 bus back to Kingsclere. Got home just after midday.
