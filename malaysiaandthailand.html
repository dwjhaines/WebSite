              This trip was supposed to be when we finally got to go back to Mabul and Sipidan. We had paid the deposit for our diving at the start of the pandemic and moved the trip several times due to lockdowns and then my lung issues in 2022. However, we found out a couple of weeks ago that my lungs are not fully healed and I am unlikely to be able to dive ever again meaning another change of plan. We decided to put off Mabul until the end of the year but still have the four week holiday to Malaysia and Thailand. We cancelled our flights to Tawau and used the refunds to book flights to Langkawi instead. Our possible dive trip to Phi Phi in the middle of our stay in Thailand has been replaced with a few days in Bangkok and we have extended our stay in the nice hotel in Nai Yang by an extra day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Still a bit sad about the diving but not too bad a holiday!

              We left Kingsclere on the 2 o'clock bus into Basingstoke (Going to Heathrow by bus and train was about half the price of parking the car for four weeks). We caught the 2:36 train to Clapham Junction and spent a couple of hours in the Wetherspoons there. We got another train to Feltham, went to our second Wetherspoons of the day and then got the bus into Terminal 4.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The terminal was fairly empty and we checked in and got through security pretty quickly. We had one more drink in the bar that used to be a Wetherspoons and boarded the 21:25 Malaysian Airlines flight to KL.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The flight was very enjoyable. They were quite generous with the alcohol compared to some Malaysian Airlines flights we have been on. We had quite a few glasses of wine with our meals and while watching films and although the flight was full, managed to get quite a bit of sleep.

              We were woken for breakfast at about 3pm Malaysian time and landed an hour and a half earlier than we had been expecting to at 5pm. However, the hour and a half that we had gained was taken away from us again as we had to queue for almost two hours to get through immigration. We have never liked KLIA and our opinion of it did not improve at all today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Once through immigration, things did improve. We got straight onto a shuttle bus to KLIA2 where we had booked a night at the Tune Hotel. We had stayed here a few times on the 2018/19 World trip as it is very handy for KLIA2. We were checked in just after 7:30 and after showers, returned to the terminal to eat. The curry place we have eaten in a few times had changed a bit but the food was still as good and we were able to have our first roti canai of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We both went for a bit of a walk round the shopping centre after eating and I carried on walking until I had done my steps for the day. We were both worn out by this point so had an alcohol free night and were in bed by 10:00.
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 17th January</span>
              We were awake at 7:15 after a pretty good nights sleep and went straight down for breakfast. We had breakfast included with the room here for the first time. it was pretty good despite the lack of roti canai. We returned to the room, packed our bags and checked out of the hotel. We walked into the terminal and checked my bag in for the 10:20 Air Asia flight to Langkawi. We went back into the shopping centre so that Roz could buy a Malaysian SIM card and then went to wait at the gate for our flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The flight left slightly early and we were in Langkawi by 11:30. We were through the airport fairly quickly and got a taxi to the Mercure Hotel at Cenang beach where we have a room booked for the next five nights. We had a bit of waiting around at reception for our room to be ready but were in it by about 12:45. Due to Roz's gold membership, we were upgraded again and have a very nice room with blcony leading out to the pool. We dropped our bags and went out to have a look round Cenang.

              We had been to Cenang in 1990 with Dave but had got bored after one night at the beach as there was nothing here. Things have changed a bit since then and there are now plenty of restaurants and shops.... and in particular duty free shops. We walked to the Northern end of the shops to get roti canai for lunch, had a quick look at the beach and then walked back buying a litre of Bacardi and some diet coke on the way.
