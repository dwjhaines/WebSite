            For the first time in 32 months, we were finally on our way back to Belgium. As we were getting an early Eurostar tomorrow morning, we had decided to travel to London today and spend the night back in the Farringdon Travelodge.

			We got the 12:03 bus from Kingsclere to Basingstoke and then the 12:35 train up to London. We got to Waterloo 20 minutes late at 13:40 and walked along the river to The Founder's Arms for our first beer of the trip. We had another sat outside The Holy Tavern (formerly The Jerusalem Taverm). This pub changed hands in February and is no longer owned by the St Peter's Brewery but it still sold their beers and had not changed much if at all. We walked from there to The Exmouth Arms. We had good seats outside here so stayed for three drinks. We were then intending to go to the hotel but got side-tracked by a happy hour at The Union Tavern. We had a couple more in there and were already fairly pissed when we checked into the hotel just after 7.

			We dropped our bags in the room and headed straight back out again. We had planned to head to The Euston Tap but as we were going out quite a bit later than we had expected to, we stayed in the area around Farringdon. We had one in The Three Kings, another in The Crown and then decided it was time to eat. We walked back to the row of restaurants near The Exmouth Arms and made the most of the good weather with an outdoor curry  at The Cinamon Tree. Made it back to the hotel by about 9:45.

            We were up at 7:00, had showers and walked to St Pancras. We bought breakfast from Greggs and went through to wait for our train. We were booked on the 9:01 to Brussels. The train was late getting in and did not leave until 9:40. We arrived in Brussels at 12:40 and caught the 13:04 to Bruges. Arrived in Bruges at 14:02 and walked to the Ibis about 10 minutes away towards the town centre.

			After showers we headed out to start on the beer. Our first was our free drink in the Ibis bar. Not the greatest of beer ranges but we both had a free Bruges Triple so could not really complain! Next was Beerpaleis. We had been in the shop before but there is a bar at the back with a small garden to sit in which was all pleasant enough. Next stop was Taphouse De Zandloper, a bar we visited a couple of times last time we were in Bruges. We got seats outside but waited 10 minutes without getting served before giving up and leaving without having a drink.

			We headed from there to 't Brugs Beertje. This is one of the best pubs in the world although we have only been in it a couple of times as it has been closed on a few occasions when we have visited Bruges. We knew that it is closed on Wednesdays so wanted to spend some time in there today. We stayed there for two and a half hours getting through seven beers between us as well as a "small nibbling platter" and a plate of pate. It was an excellent place to visit again and definitely one of our favourite pubs anywhere.

        <p class="diary-text">
			Feeling quite light-headed, we made our way from there through the main square to De Vloamse Trine, a new one for us that I had read about on the Belgium Beer Forum. Another nice enough place to sit with Affligen Triple on tap. After a pint there, we went to our final bar of the day Le Trappiste. We had three drinks in there before walking back to the hotel. We were back at the hotel just after 11.

            I got up at 9ish and went out to Panos and Carrefour to buy breakfast. We ate in the room and went out sightseeing a couple of hours later. We had planned to walk out to Damme along the route we have cycled a couple of times but it is five miles in each direction and we decided it was too hot for such an expedition. Instead, we spent a couple of hours wandering round the city centre visiting a couple of churches and taking photos of the main squares.

			We had a couple of hours back in the room and went out to start drinking again at 3. Our first drink was at Beerpaleis. Roz had seen someone drinking Paix Dieu while we were there yesterday and she liked the shape of the glasses. The beer was a draught 10% triple and a good start to the session.

			After one in there, we spent the rest of the afternoon at The Bourgogne des Flandres Brewery. This is an excellent place that we had discovered the last time we were in Bruges. We got the same table that we had sat at last time and had a very enjoyable time sat by the canal sampling their beers. We had a tasting "flight" each and then a couple more of their beers and stayed there until it closed at 6:30.

			We went from there to De Garrre, another of Bruge's most famous beer bars that regularly seems to be closed when we visit. We had not really liked it that much the last time we visited for some reason but it seemed better tonight and we both enjoyed the house triple. After a couple more drinks we walked through the main square to Cambrinus. Cafe Cambrinus, the bar we have visited before was closed (permanently??) but there was another bigger bar/restaurant a bit further along the road with the same name. We had another tasting board in here and then a couple more drinks before heading back to the hotel for a relatively early night.
