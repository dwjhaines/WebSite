            For the first time in 32 months, we were finally on our way back to Belgium. As we were getting an early Eurostar tomorrow morning, we had decided to travel to London today and spend the night back in the Farringdon Travelodge.

			We got the 12:03 bus from Kingsclere to Basingstoke and then the 12:35 train up to London. We got to Waterloo 20 minutes late at 13:40 and walked along the river to The Founder's Arms for our first beer of the trip. We had another sat outside The Holy Tavern (formerly The Jerusalem Taverm). This pub changed hands in February and is no longer owned by the St Peter's Brewery but it still sold their beers and had not changed much if at all. We walked from there to The Exmouth Arms. We had good seats outside here so stayed for three drinks. We were then intending to go to the hotel but got side-tracked by a happy hour at The Union Tavern. We had a couple more in there and were already fairly pissed when we checked into the hotel just after 7.

			We dropped our bags in the room and headed straight back out again. We had planned to head to The Euston Tap but as we were going out quite a bit later than we had expected to, we stayed in the area around Farringdon. We had one in The Three Kings, another in The Crown and then decided it was time to eat. We walked back to the row of restaurants near The Exmouth Arms and made the most of the good weather with an outdoor curry  at The Cinamon Tree. Made it back to the hotel by about 9:45.

            We were up at 7:00, had showers and walked to St Pancras. We bought breakfast from Greggs and went through to wait for our train. We were booked on the 9:01 to Brussels. The train was late getting in and did not leave until 9:40. We arrived in Brussels at 12:40 and caught the 13:04 to Bruges. Arrived in Bruges at 14:02 and walked to the Ibis about 10 minutes away towards the town centre.

        <p class="diary-text">
			After showers we headed out to start on the beer. Our first was our free drink in the Ibis bar. Not the greatest of beer ranges but we both had a free Bruges Tripel so could not really complain! Next was Beerpaleis. We had been in the shop before but there is a bar at the back with a small garden to sit in which was all pleasant enough. Next stop was Taphouse De Zandloper, a bar we visited a couple of times last time we were in Bruges. We got seats outside but waited 10 minutes without getting served before giving up and leaving without having a drink.

			We headed from there to 't Brugs Beertje. This is one of the best pubs in the world although we have only been in it a couple of times as it has been closed on a few occasions when we have visited Bruges. We knew that it is closed on Wednesdays so wanted to spend some time in there today. We stayed there for two and a half hours getting through seven beers between us as well as a "small nibbling platter" and a plate of pate. It was an excellent place to visit again and definitely one of our favourite pubs anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			Feeling quite light-headed, we made our way from there through the main square to De Vloamse Trine, a new one for us that I had read about on the Belgium Beer Forum. Another nice enough place to sit with Affligen Tripel on tap. After a pint there, we went to our final bar of the day Le Trappiste. We had three drinks in there before walking back to the hotel. We were back at the hotel just after 11.

            I got up at 9ish and went out to Panos and Carrefour to buy breakfast. We ate in the room and went out sightseeing a couple of hours later. We had planned to walk out to Damme along the route we have cycled a couple of times but it is five miles in each direction and we decided it was too hot for such an expedition. Instead, we spent a couple of hours wandering round the city centre visiting a couple of churches and taking photos of the main squares.

			We had a couple of hours back in the room and went out to start drinking again at 3. Our first drink was at Beerpaleis. Roz had seen someone drinking Paix Dieu while we were there yesterday and she liked the shape of the glasses. The beer was a draught 10% tripel and a good start to the session.

			After one in there, we spent the rest of the afternoon at The Bourgogne des Flandres Brewery. This is an excellent place that we had discovered the last time we were in Bruges. We got the same table that we had sat at last time and had a very enjoyable time sat by the canal sampling the beer that is brewed there. We had a tasting "flight" each and then a couple more of their beers and stayed there until it closed at 6:30.

			We went from there to De Garrre, another of Bruge's most famous beer bars that regularly seems to be closed when we visit. We had not really liked it that much the last time we visited for some reason but it seemed better tonight and we both enjoyed the house tripel. After a couple more drinks we walked through the main square to Bierbrasserie Cambrinus. Cafe Cambrinus, the bar we have visited before was closed (permanently??) but there was another bigger bar/restaurant a bit further along the road with the same name. This seemed to be just as good as the old place with the same large range of beers. We had another tasting board in here and then a couple more drinks before heading back to the hotel for a relatively early night.

            I was up before 9 and walked to the station to buy breakfast (Panos again). I went for another walk around Bruges while Roz stayed in bed. We checked out of the hotel at 11:30 and walked to the station where we caught the 11:58 train back to Brussels.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We arrived at Brussels central station on time at 12:58. We could not check into our apartment until 2 so went down to buy food for lunch before going and sitting in reception to wait for our room key. The receptionist turned up at about 1:45 and we were in our apartment (36) about 10 minutes later. It is the third time we have stayed in the B-Apartments and have probably stayed in the same room before.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			After we had eaten, I was quite keen to start drinking again but we decided that a healthier option would be to walk out to the Atomium. We had thought about doing this on a previous visit to Brussels but the weather had not been good. I had thought about going there tomorrow before the brewery trip but we headed off just after 2:30 for the four mile walk through some of the less touristy areas of Brussels.

        <p class="diary-text">
			The Atomium itself was quite impressive. We had no great desire to pay almost €15 each to go inside it but it was quite good just walking up to it and underneath it. We wandered round the shop which was not great but we spent 20 minutes or so taking photos outside before starting our walk back to the centre of Brussels.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We were getting quite hot and tired by the time we got back to the Sainte Catherine area and called in for our first beer of the day at the Brussels Beer Project. This is a place that I have thought about visiting a few times but it never seems to have happened for one reason or another. It was actually a much nicer, more old-fashioned bar than I had expected it to be. We had a couple of bottles of the Lazy Monkie IPA, a very nice beer, and then walked back to the apartment.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			After showers, we went out to visit some of the Brussels bars that we have not been to for a while. We had one in The Toone and then went to A l'Imaige Nostre-Dame. This place is usually really busy when we come to Brussels at the weekend but it was quieter tonight and we were able to get a table. I had a couple of tripels in there while Roz sampled the new Kwak glass!

        <p class="diary-text">
			We walked round the corner from there to À la Bécasse. This place was totally empty apart from us and a cat. We had a small jug of their white lambic beer and then headed across the Grand Place to Poechenellekelder. This was fairly busy as the biggest room had been completely reserved but we were given a table in the room at the top of the stairs and as usual, it was a nice place to sit for a couple of hours. We had five drinks between us as well as our evening meal - a portion of pate. Although we had had a few, Roz was not keen on drinking too much so we returned to the apartment after these. Got back at about 11:30

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 15th July</span>
            Roz went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We went out for a walk at 10:45 and spent an hour or so wandering round the Grand Place/Bourse area again. We stopped at a couple of supermarkets looking for Mort Subite kriek to take home and then returned to the apartment for showers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			We had an early start to today's session as we wanted to be at the Cantillon Brewery by 2:30. We left the hotel at 12:30 and went first to Mort Subite just around the corner. We had one in there and then, unusually for a Belgium session, we went for lunch in a pizza restaurant. Roz had seen recommendations for Il Collosso about 10 minutes walk away and slightly outside the main touristy area. We had a few Hoegardens with a couple of very good pizzas and then had a 30 minute walk to get to the brewery.

			As usual here, we did not bother with the tour but spent a couple of hours in the bar getting through three bottles, two of the 2021 gueuze and one of Grand Cru Bruocsella. It was excellent here again despite a particularly annoying American family with their four children. Roz bought her fist t-shirt of the day.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We left the brewery at about 4:30 when it was closing and had a short walk to L' Ermitage a new bar for us. This was another very good place. It was a relatively new craft beer brewery with a bar in an old warehouse type building. Roz had another tasting paddle while I tried three of their beers. We had a couple more of the sour fruit beers before leaving.

        <p class="diary-text">
			From the brewery we started heading back towards the centre of Brussels stopping at Moeder Lambic for one on the way. We went from there for one in Porte Noir and then to Little Delirium. This was another place we had not been in before. As the name suggests, it was a lot smaller and all a bit more subdued than the main Delirium bar. It was another very pleasant place to sit while getting through three rounds of Westmalle Tripels. Roz managed to get a "complimentary" elephant t-shirt.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
			I don't clearly remember leaving here or anything else about the rest of the night but it would appear that we had another Westmalle Tripel in Au Brasseur (Elephant Bar) before walking back to the hotel just after 10:30. A good day out!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 16th July</span>
            We had breakfast in the apartment again and checked out just before 11. We walked to Gare Midi, bought food and drink for the journey and went through to wait for the 12:52 Eurostar back to London.
