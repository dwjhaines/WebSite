          We caught the 1pm bus from Kingsclere to Basingstoke and then the 13:49 train to Reading. We were not in any hurry to get to Heathrow so went to the Wetherspoons for lunch and a few drinks. We walked back to the station and had a few more drinks in The Three Guineas before getting an Elizabeth line train to West Drayton at 6:30. We had one more drink in the pub by the station, bought food and a couple of bottles of wine and caught a bus to The Thistle Hotel near Terminal 5.

          We were awake at 5:30, had quick showers and then caught the 6am bus to Terminal 5, about 5 minutes away. Although not in the hotel for long, it was an ideal place to stay for an early morning flight. Heathrow seemed relatively quiet so we were through security fairly quickly. We had breakfast and had about an hour to wait for the 7:35 flight to Warsaw. The flight was less than half full so boarding was also quick and we took off on time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We landed just before 11:00 local time and got through immigration remarkably quickly. We walked through the airport and got on a train towards the centre of town. We thought that this would take us all the way to Central Station but it started heading off in a different direction so we got off and got on the metro. This took us to within 500m of the Novotel where we had a room booked for the night. We walked to the hotel and were able to check in just after midday. We have a room on the 15th floor with a very good view of the Palace of Culture and Science.

          We dropped our bags in the room and went straight out for lunch/sight-seeing. We walked first to Central Station to check where tomorrow's train was departing from. We headed into the old town and stopped for a lunch of Polish dumplings (pierogi) and our first beer of the day on the way. There were not too many sights that we wanted to see as we had been here a few years ago but it we continued walking up through the old town to the Royal Castle. We spent a bit of time wandering round the squares in that area and then walked back to the hotel
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          At 4:15, we went down to the hotel bar for our welcome drink and then headed out for a pub crawl. Last time we were in Warsaw, there were a few good craft beer pubs here. Since then, craft beer seems to have become more popular and there are now a lot more. We had a list of seven to visit, all within about half a mile of our hotel. First stop was Hoppiness, a bar that was here the last time we visited. From there we went to Pinta, a new one with its own brewery. Next on the list was Piwpaw Beer Heaven. We had been to Piwpaw last time but the old bar has closed and they have reopened in a new location. This place was a lot nicer than the old one and we ended up staying here for a few drinks.

          Things start getting a bit vague after leaving here. We had not eaten much today and the beers we were drinking were all about 6%. We had one sat outside Cuda Na Kiju, missed Drugie Dno and went straight to Jabeerwocky. Apparently we had a final drink in Kufle i Kapsle but I have no recollection of this at all.

          We were up by 8, checked out of the hotel and walked to the station stopping to buy food for breakfast on the way. We were at the station in plenty of time for the 9:19 train to Wrocław. The train was on time. We had booked 1st class tickets for zł135 (about £25) for the four and three quarter hour journey. The train was very comfortable and arrived in Wrocław on time at 14:05. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text"> 
          We walked from the station to the Ibis Hotel which was slightly further away than we were expecting but still only about 10 minutes away. After an  hour or so in the room, we headed out for another pub crawl. We had our welcome drink in the hotel bar and then started walking into town. We had another list of craft beer pubs to aim for but had only got as far as the train lines when we found a row of small bars in the arches. We stopped for one in Mistrz i Małgorzata which was a nice bar with a few beers.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We continued walking into town and got to the first bar on my list - AleBrowar. We had not planned on eating here but when we saw the pizzas, we ordered a couple. This was a good move as the pizzas were excellent and the beer also good. The second bar, Szynkarnia was OK but not great. We were just about in the centre when we got to the next bar Pod Latarniami. This one was also nothing special and was a bit close to Pub Guinness where our fans had inevitably started to congregate.

          We had another beer in Kombinat, our favourite bar from six years ago and then had a look around the main square taking photos of the dwarfs before starting to head back towards the hotel. We had another beer at Kontynuacja and then a couple more at Kraft Daily, another of the bars in the railway arches. Got back to the hotel just after 11pm.

          We were able to have a lie in today for the first time in a couple of days. We got up at 10ish and left the hotel at 10:30. We walked back into the old town stopping for breakfast on the way. In the town, Roz bought a "Dwarf Map" and we went to collect our tickets for tomorrow from The F. A. We then spent a couple of hours walking round while Roz ticked off the dwarfs listed on her map. We started in the main squares and found most of them in that area, then walked out across the river to the two big churches.

          We walked back to the hotel via the centre again stopping for lunch and a few more dwarfs on the way. We were back in the hotel by about 2:30.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out again at about 3:30. Steve was due to land in Wrocław at about 4pm. We headed back to AleBrowar again to meet him with a slight detour for more dwarf spotting on the way. We had had a couple of drinks by the time Steve arrived and we had a few more with him as well as another pizza each. We left there just before 8 and went to pick up Steve's match ticket. We then went into the main square where we eventually met up with Bob, Gavin, Mick, Neil, Mark and Sheila who had all got out here via a variety of different routes.

          We had one drink with them before we all moved to Pub Guinness for some reason. One of the others was supposed to be meeting someone else there although I am not sure who as we were not joined by anyone else. It was not too bad in there, however and not quite as noisy as it had been the night before. We had another three rounds in there before Roz and I departed and started heading back to our hotel. We stopped for one on the way at Kontynuacja and a final drink at Kraft Daily. Back in the hotel by about 1:15.

          We checked out of the hotel at 11:30, left our bags in the luggage room and headed back into town. We stopped on the way to find a few more of the dwarfs and then bought breakfast which we ate sat on a bench. We continued walking round a couple of areas that we did not go to yesterday bringing Roz's total to 97 of the 100 on her map.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We met up with everyone else again at a bar along form the Irish pub. This was not a great place but we stayed in there for a couple before people started drifting off towards the ground. At about 3:30, Roz and I made our way back to AleBrowar for a couple. We were joined by Steve and Sheila but they had run out of pizza dough so Sheila left almost straight away so she could get something to eat at the ground. We stayed for a couple of drinks and left for the ground just before 5. There were no taxis available so the three of us got a tram instead. It was a bit slow, hot and crowded but it got us there eventually.

          There was a lot of confusion outside the ground as we had no indication of which turnstiles to use, there was no-one about who seemed to know where we should go and the signs were poor or non-existent. Somehow, I managed to get in through what I thought was the correct turnstile only to find myself in the Ukraine end with no way of getting into the England section. I was told I would have to go out of the ground and back in again but I was not prepared to do that so decided to stay where I was. Roz and Steve managed to get through the correct turnstiles so were in the right part of the ground.

          The area that I was in was fine for watching the game. There were plenty of other England fans in there, either by choice or for the same reason as me. I was also able to get a beer in this section! I spoke to Roz at half-time and we arranged to meet back in the centre after the game. There did not seem any point trying to meet up outside the ground.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a pretty dull game, I got straight out and onto a tram back to the centre. I had a drink in the Irish pub while waiting for Roz and Steve who had been kept in the ground for 10 minutes or so after the game. Neither Roz or Steve wanted to drink anymore so we went for a kebab instead. We said goodbye to Steve and walked back to the hotel to collect our bags before walking to the station where we had a wait of just over an hour for the 23:35 train back to Warsaw.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We had booked a two birth sleeping compartment for the overnight journey and once again, it was very good value at just under £40 each. The train came in on time and we got straight into our compartment which already had the beds made up for us. It was a very comfortable way of getting back.

          We were woken at 5:30 with cups of tea and coffee and the train got into Warszawa Gdańska exactly on time at 06:03. From here, there was a direct train to the airport leaving 20 minutes later. We were at the airport at about 7 and went straight to McDonalds for breakfast. After eating, we went through security and had a three hour wait for 10:35 Aegean flight to Athens.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          This flight was fairly full and a bit late leaving but we were in Athens by about 2pm. We then had another three hour wait before we could board the 17:30 flight to Leros. This was also on time and we landed in Leros just after 18:00. We walked straight out of the airport and got to taxi to Eleona's at Alinda Beach.

          We were met by Dimitri again and shown to the same apartment that we stayed in a year ago. We were both worn out from quite a bit of travelling in the last 24 hours but it was very good to be back again and find that nothing has changed in the last year. We dropped our bags in the room and went straight out to a supermarket for retsina and drinking water. We had much needed showers and then a couple of drinks sat on our balcony.

          We ate out at To Steki. Again, nothing had changed here and the food was as good as it was last year. We had more retsina and white with our meals and then returned to the terrace at the back of our apartment to finish the retsina we had bought earlier.

          We did not have quite as much to do today. We were up by about 10:00 and had breakfast on our balcony. We do not have breakfast included here but Dimitri had left some food in the apartment for us and we had a plate of cheese pies waiting for us on the balcony when we got up.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We spent an hour or so on the beach and then walked to the bigger supermarket to stock up on provisions for the  next few days before eating lunch on the balcony. It was back to the beach again in the afternoon and a very similar evening to yesterday.

          Much the same as yesterday. We had breakfast on the balcony and once again, it was a mixture of the food left in the apartment and ham and cheese pies given to us by Dimitri. I went for a few walks - firstly to the closest supermarket for water, then after a couple of hours on the beach to the bigger one for more retsina. We had lunch on the balcony and I went out again to the Northern end of the bay to get my 12,500 steps for the day.

          We returned to the beach in the afternoon for a couple more hours. We started the evening with a few drinks on the balcony and returned to eat at To Steki for the third night in a row. It has been quite windy since we got here but we have stuck with eating at the tables on the beach. We were the only ones on the beach yesterday but were joined by a few more people this evening. We returned to the apartment after eating and watched the second half of Scotland v England on our back terrace.

          We discovered after breakfast that our Skopje flight in November had been cancelled for the second time so we had to spend about half an hour sorting that out. Once this was done, I walked to Agia Marina and back. I decided to get my walking out of the way early today. The walk including a trip up to the supermarket is about five miles.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had lunch on the balcony and a couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon. Today was the first day of the trip without alcohol. We were both in need of a night off! We decided we would also have a change of restaurant for one night and walked down to Prima Plora, the only other restaurant here that we have eaten in before. We were back at Eleona's by 8:30 and did not do a lot for the rest of the evening.

          We were awake earlier this morning due to the lack of alcohol yesterday. We walked up to the bakery near the supermarket to buy stuff for breakfast which we ate on the balcony. I decided to get my steps done early again so went off to Agia Marina again straight after eating. I checked on the taxi prices to see if it worth hiring a car on Saturday. The prices for taxis here seem very expensive but will still work out slightly cheaper than the car hire option so we will give up on that idea.

          After walking back, I joined Roz on the beach. After an hour in the sun we went for a swim - me 1.2km, Roz a bit further. Another hour or so on the beach in the afternoon before going back to the room for showers. We were back on the wine/retsina by 7. We had a few on the balcony and then a couple of litres in To Steki. We drank more before going out tonight and had an extra half litre in the restaurant. Neither of us remember getting back to the apartment.

          I decided against the beach this morning as I was a bit burnt from yesterday. Roz went down at 11 while I headed off on a slightly longer walk than usual. I went to Agia Marina again but this time continued past the port and up the  hill to the castle. The castle was still free to enter so I went in and took a few photos while recovering from the climb. I walked down the hill to Panteli Beach which did not look as busy as I remember it being last year and from there, up the hill to Dimitris o Karaflas where I booked a table for tomorrow night.

          From there, it was back down to Agia Marina and back along Alinda via the supermarket. In total the walk was 8.4 miles and took almost exactly three hours. We had lunch on the balcony and then went out again to buy water. Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon apart from an hour on the beach.

          Tonight was our last night at Eleona's. The time here has gone very quickly. Our final evening was much the same as the others - drinks on the balcony, a meal at To Steki and a few more drinks when we got back. We got to bed before 11, a lot more sober than we had been last night.

We paid our bill and were taken the three miles or so over to Tony's Beach Resort at Vromolithos. This is the third time we have stayed here and this time, we got one of the rooms upstairs in the block closest to the sea. This has a better view than the room  we were in last year and more space on the balcony. We unpacked and then walked to the supermarket in Lakki to buy provisions for the next couple of days.
