          We caught the 1pm bus from Kingsclere to Basingstoke and then the 13:49 train to Reading. We were not in any hurry to get to Heathrow so went to the Wetherspoons for lunch and a few drinks. We walked back to the station and had a few more drinks in The Three Guineas before getting an Elizabeth line train to West Drayton at 6:30. We had one more drink in the pub by the station, bought food and a couple of bottles of wine and caught a bus to The Thistle Hotel near Terminal 5.

          We were not near a great selection of pubs so drank the wine in the room before going to bed.

          We were awake at 5:30, had quick showers and then caught the 6am bus to Terminal 5, about 5 minutes away. Although not in the hotel for long, it was an ideal place to stay for an early morning flight. Heathrow seemed relatively quiet so we were through security fairly quickly. We had breakfast and had about an hour to wait for the 7:35 flight to Warsaw. The flight was less than half full so boarding was also quick and we took off on time.

          We landed just before 11:00 local time and got through immigration remarkably quickly. We walked through the airport and got on a train towards the centre of town. We thought that this would take us all the way to Central Station but it started heading off in a different direction so we got off and got on the metro. This took us to within 500m of the Novotel where we had a room booked for the night. We walked to the hotel and were able to check in just after midday. We have a room on the 15th floor with a very good view of the Palace of Culture and Science.

          We dropped our bags in the room and went straight out for lunch/sight-seeing. We walked first to Central Station to check where our train was departing from for tomorrow morning. We headed into the old town and stopped for a lunch of Polish dumplings (pierogi) and our first beer of the day on the way. There were not too many sights that we wanted to see as we had been here a few years ago but it we continued walking up through the old town to the Royal Castle. We spent a bit of time wandering round the squares in that area and then walked back to the hotel

          At 4:15, we went down to the hotel bar for our welcome drink and then headed out for a pub crawl. Last time we were in Warsaw, there were a few good craft beer pubs here. Since then, craft beer seems to have become more popular and there are now a lot more. We had a list of seven to visit, all within about half a mile of our hotel. First stop was Hoppiness, a bar that was here the last time we visited. From there we went to Pinta, a new one with its own brewery. Next on the list was Piwpaw Beer Heaven. We had been to Piwpaw last time but the old bar has closed and they have reopened in a new location. This place was a lot nicer than the old one and we ended up staying here for a few drinks.

          Things start getting a bit vague after leaving here. We had not eaten much today and the beers we were drinking were all about 6%. We had one sat outside Cuda Na Kiju, missed Drugie Dno and went straight to Jabeerwocky. Apparently we had a final drink in Kufle i Kapsle but I have no recollection of this at all.

          We were up by 8, checked out of the hotel and walked to the station stopping to buy food for breakfast on the way. We were at the station in plenty of time for the 9:19 train to Wrocław. The train was on time. We had booked 1st class tickets for zł135 (about £25) for the five hour journey and the train was very comfortable.
