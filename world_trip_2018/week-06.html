            We had breakfast and spent an hour or so sat in the restaurant before checking out at 11:00. We got another taxi to the railway station and sat in McDonalds while we waited for our train. Our train was at 13:43 and predictably, it left exactly on time for the four hour journey back to Moscow.

            <p class="diary-text">It was an uneventful journey. We arrived in Moscow at 5:30 and got the metro to Sevastopolskaya near to where we are stying for the next two nights. It took us a while to find our hotel but again the locals kept giving us directions and eventually someone just walked us to the door. Check-in took ages and was the first place since we arrived in Russia where the staff were not particularly friendly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The hotel seemed excellent after the last two nights. There was nothing wrong with the hotel in Nizhny but not having air-conditioning in that heat meant that you are constantly sweating and do not really sleep properly once the sun comes up (at about 3:30 am). It was good to have a proper shower and feel clean again for the first time in a couple of days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We met Steve in reception at 7:45 and went out to find somewhere to eat and watch this evenings games. We struggled initially but eventually found a pretty good bar/restaurant with teles everywhere and good food (ToDaSyo or ТоДаСё). It also had a two for one offer on all its beer on a Monday which was a bonus! We had expected to meet two other friends who we know from previous tournaments this evening, but by the time they had arrived in Moscow they decided not to come out so we will meet them tomorrow instead. We stayed in the bar until the end of the Portugal v Iran game and returned to the hotel for a relatively early night.
