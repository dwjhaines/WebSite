            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 25th June</span>
            We had breakfast and spent an hour or so sat in the restaurant before checking out at 11:00. We got another taxi to the railway station and sat in McDonalds while we waited for our train. Our train was at 13:43 and predictably, it left exactly on time for the four hour journey back to Moscow.
            </p>    
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-037.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">It was an uneventful journey. We arrived in Moscow at 5:30 and got the metro to Sevastopolskaya near to where we are staying for the next two nights. It took us a while to find our hotel but again the locals kept giving us directions and eventually someone just walked us to the door. Check-in took ages and was the first place since we arrived in Russia where the staff were inefficient and not particularly friendly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The hotel seemed excellent after the last two nights. There was nothing wrong with the hotel in Nizhny but not having air-conditioning in that heat meant that you are constantly sweating and do not really sleep properly once the sun comes up (at about 3:30 am). It was good to have a proper shower and feel clean again for the first time in a couple of days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We met Steve in reception at 7:45 and went out to find somewhere to eat and watch this evenings games. We struggled initially but eventually found a pretty good bar/restaurant with teles everywhere and good food (ToDaSyo or ТоДаСё). It also had a two for one offer on all its beer on a Monday which was a bonus! We had expected to meet Fred and Steve who we know from previous tournaments this evening, but by the time they had arrived in Moscow they decided not to come out so we will meet them tomorrow instead. We stayed in the bar until the end of the Portugal v Iran game and returned to the hotel for a relatively early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th June</span>
            Met Steve for breakfast just after 9:00 and spent the rest of the morning looking into options for the rest of the tournament. We know that England have qualified for the next round but still do not know where they will be playing. If we win our group we have a possible path to the final playing in Rostov, Kazan, St Petersburg. If we come second, it would be Moscow, Samara, Moscow. We are not getting carried away about anything but booking things in advance saves a lot of time and money. The Russian train tickets are refundable if we do not use then so we booked our returns from Rostov and outward tickets to Samara. Every booking takes time and tickets go up in price so it was worth getting this done. Once everyone knows where our next game is, prices for transport and accommodation will go up very quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We gave up on this at 11:30 and got the Metro into the centre of Moscow. We met Fred and Steve near Red Square and spent a few hours with them in a bar where we had lunch and a drink. We split up from them at about 3 as they all had tickets for the France v Denmark game at the Luzhniki Stadium. Roz and I went off for a couple of hours of sightseeing.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-038.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">There was not that much here that we wanted to see. We have been to Moscow before so have seen most of the major sights. However, it is still a superb place just to wander around and things do look different in June to how they looked in the November snow in 2007. We walked past the Bolshoi theater and joined the queues to get into Red Square. There are a lot of football fans around (mainly South Americans) and security is very tight getting into anywhere. Red Square is very spectacular even with the FIFA Fans "Play Area" or whatever it is called, dominating one end of it. We walked the length of the square up to Saint Basil's Cathedral passing Lenin's Mausoleum and the walls of The Kremlin on one side and the impressive GUM shopping centre on the other.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After getting our photos, we left the square and walked through GUM. This is not as spectacular on the inside as the outside but is still worth seeing and we were trying (unsuccessfully) to find a book shop so we could replace the Russia Lonely Planet that we think we left on the train yesterday. We walked from there up a pedestrianised street packed with bars and football fans to get to Lubyanka. We went to the FIFA shop here which was as poor as most of the others we have seen and then got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were going to watch the France v Denmark game in the hotel but it was a pretty dire game and we did not bother watching most of it. We waited until after it had finished and got the metro back into the centre to meet the others. We had planned to meet up in the place we had been in at lunchtime but when Steve arrived, all the tables were reserved. It was quite an upmarket area and it was difficult to find anywhere reasonable to watch the 9:00 game. Even the Irish bar was full! They eventually found a Moldavian restaurant tucked away down an alley. This proved quite lucky as the food was better than it had been at lunchtime and it was a nicer place to eat. We said our goodbyes to Fred and Steve after the game (not sure if we will see them again) and got the metro back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 27th June</span>
            Steve had left earlier than us today as he was on an early flight to Kaliningrad but he phoned us from the airport to say that the airline had no record of his booking and he had had to book a later flight. We had managed to check in yesterday so were fairly sure that ours was OK. We checked out of the hotel at 9:30. Check-out was every bit as efficient as check-in and it all took a while again. We left most of our luggage at the hotel as we will be back here again on Friday.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">We got the Metro into the centre again. The Metro here is excellent once you have worked out how it all works. The Cyrillic alphabet does cause a few problems but we are getting used to it and even if you go wrong it does not take long to correct the error. The trains are fast, tickets are cheap and I don't think we have had to wait more than a minute for a train since we have been here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We stopped at Arbatskaya to buy a replacement Lonely Planet. We had stopped at a couple of places last night to look for the book. We had not been able to find it but one shop assistant had looked it up on the computer for us and told us about another branch where we would be able to get a copy. He was right and we were able to buy a more up to date version than the one we had lost so this had not worked out too badly
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got back on the Metro and continued our journey to Belorusskaya from where we got the AeroExpress to Sheremetyevo Airport. We had lunch before boarding the 13:50 flight to Kaliningrad which left on time. We landed at Kaliningrad at about 14:45, Kaliningrad time which is one hour behind Moscow. We were met outside the airport by Mark, the owner of the apartment we had booked, and he drove us to the apartment in Svetlogorsk. Kaliningrad  was another place where accommodation was difficult and it was a lot cheaper to stay outside the city and travel in for the game. Svetlogorsk is a small beach resort about 40km North.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-039.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The apartment is nice enough again. There is no air-con but it is a lot cooler than places we have been previously so this should not be an issue. By the time Mark had left, the Germany v South Korea game had started. There was a supermarket over the road so we got a couple of beers and had the enjoyment of watching the Germans getting knocked out before England for a change.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into the centre of Svetlogorsk after the game. It is a lot more like a Western European resort than any of the places in Russia we have been to so far. We had a drink in a bar by the water tower, which is the towns most famous sight before walking down to have a quick look at the sea. We found a place right in the centre that had a reasonable atmosphere (a lot of drunk Germans!) and good beer and stayed there to watch Brazil v Serbia. We ate in there during the game and waited for Steve who finally arrived after a lot of delays just after the game finished. We had one more beer and got a taxi back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th June - 21:00 England Reserves v Belgium Reserves</span>
            We bought food for breakfast from the supermarket and ate in the apartment. Did not do a lot for the rest of the morning. Roz and I walked to the train station which is only 5 minutes walk away and bought tickets for the 12:32 train to Kaliningrad (25 mile journey for about 90p each). 
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We got into Kaliningrad about at about 1:30. The town centre seemed a lot busier than at previous venues. It is a much smaller town but with the same number of people around. We walked through the main square which was packed with Belgians. Once again, we were heavily outnumbered. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The only sight that we were really interested in seeing was Kaliiningrad cathedral. This was about a mile from the centre. We walked there, had a look around and then returned to the main square. The micro brewery (РЕСТОРАН "ХМЕЛЬ") that we were looking to drink in was right on the square and we were lucky to get the only empty table when we arrived. The beer was very good again so we had a few there as well as an excellent meal. They brewed a wheat beer which was about the cheapest we have had since being in Russia. We were sat outside so were able to watch the fans gathering in the square. Again, a very good atmosphere.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-040.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We moved to the inside of the pub at about 5:00 to watch the second half of the Japan v Poland game and then started heading towards the ground. We were only a few minutes from the station so walked back there and got straight onto a shuttle bus. This dropped us about 10 minutes walk from the ground. We got in easily, got ourselves another beer and were in our seats about an hour before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was poor. Everyone else seems happy that we have lost as it makes our plans easier. I thought we had a good chance to win the group and should have gone for it. If we win next week, it will have been justified but with the amount of hassle and expense we have had getting to this game it all felt a bit disappointing. I never like watching games where the teams are not trying to win. I am not that convinced that finishing second in the group actually increases our chances of going further but I guess we will find out next week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the game, we left immediately and got straight back onto a shuttle bus. The organisation here has been superb (a lot better than in France!) and about 30 minutes after the final whistle, we were back in the same pub as before the game. We were lucky to get in again. There were queues to get in at the main door but as we were looking at a locked door, another customer opened it for us and we were able to get in and have another drink. We only stayed for one before getting the 23:30 back to Svetlogorsk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 29th June</span>
            Breakfast in the apartment again and then a couple of hours of sorting out what we are doing for the next week or so. First of all, we canceled trains and accommodation that we had booked for the second round game in Rostov on Dom. We will now be playing in Moscow instead. We booked trains back from Samara where England will play their quarter final if we win next week. Again, we are not assuming that they will win but canceling train tickets and getting a full refund is very easy so better to get them booked. As we have four days until the next game, we also booked train tickets to Saint Petersburg for tomorrow. We will stay there a couple of nights and get back to Moscow by Tuesday. We booked a hotel there but are so far unable to book the train back. There are places available on the free trains but we are unable to book them at the moment. Also booked another night at the Sevastople Modern in Moscow for the day of the game.</p> 
            <p class="diary-text">Steve left at about 1:00. He is not flying back to Moscow until tomorrow so got the train back into Kaliningrad where he will stay tonight. We will meet up with him again in Saint Petersburg.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Mark's mother-in-law picked me and Roz up at 1:30 and drove us to the airport. We had an hour or so to kill there before the 15:45 Aeroflot flight back to Moscow. The flight was a bit late getting in but we were back into Sheremetyevo just before 7:00. We needed to pick up our tickets for the second round game next week. We have "conditional tickets" for all England's games from now on meaning that we only get tickets if England stay in the competition. There are ticket collection points in all the host cities but also at the major airports. This process was quicker than expected. There was a bit of a queue but one of the helpers took us to a machine which printed out all three of our tickets within a couple of minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got the 7:30 AeroExpress back into Belorusskaya. We tried again on the train to book our return tickets from Saint Petersburg, again without success. The fact that we have match tickets entitles us to use the free train but the website kept telling us we did not have match tickets. At Belorusskaya, we went to the ticket office to try and sort this out. We got sent around a couple of offices and were told that we were not entitled to free tickets. One of the volunteers at the ticket office told us that he thought this was wrong and directed us to one of his colleagues. He was another volunteer and spent about 30 minutes booking the tickets for us. He used the same web site but found a number on the tickets that was different to the one I had used before and everything went through eventually. There are first class compartments on this train so we will have a compartment to ourselves for this journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once all this was sorted out, we got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya and walked back to the hotel we had left a couple of days ago. Thankfully check-in was a lot quicker this time and we were in the room before 10:00. We were both totally worn out by now. The rooms in both Nizhny and Svetlogorsk have been too hot and or too light from very early making getting a good nights sleep difficult. Too many late nights watching football and too much beer over the last ten days have not helped either! We could not be bothered to go out to eat so ate the remains of the biscuits we had bought in Nizhny before going to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th June</span>
            Spent the morning in the room looking into options for Samara if we get to the quarter finals. We didn't really get anything sorted but if England get there instead of Colombia, a lot of rooms should become available. There are a lot more of them traveling than England fans.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We checked out of the hotel at 11:30 and again, left half our luggage in the luggage room as we will be back next week. We got the Metro to Komsomolskaya which is the stop for Leningradski station from where all the Saint Petersburg trains depart. We had about 30 minutes to kill there before boarding the 13:30 train.... which left on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got into Saint Petersburg at 5:30. We knew that it was going to be colder here but it can't have been more than about 12°c. Everyone else on the train was were putting on coats, hats and scarves as we arrived. We had to walk to the hotel in shorts, t-shirts and sandels.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-041.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The hotel was about a ten minute walk from the station. We checked in and watched the second half of the France v Argentina game in the room. We went straight out again when the game finished. On our way to the hotel we had walked past a Belgium beer bar. This seemed like a good place to meet Steve who was due to arrive at the station at 21:15. We walked back there and reserved a table for 21:00 when the Portugal v Uruguay game starts. We then went off for a couple of hours of sightseeing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not make it into the main centre but spent a couple of hours walking round a circuit of the sights near to the hotel. Although we did not get to most of the main sights we did see the Church of the Spilt Blood which is one of the main sights and is not far from where we are staying. This was quite spectacular although a lot of it was being restored and was covered in scaffolding which was a shame. It was also very close to the location of the fan fest meaning that the area was very crowded. From our initial look around, we were very impressed with the city. Lots more to see tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We made it back to Manneken Pis Bar just before kick-off and were joined by Steve about 30 minutes later. We ate and had a few drinks in there before returning to the hotel. Got to bed just before midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 1st July</span>
            The weather forecast for today on the BBC had said it would be cloudy and breezy. This turned out to be rainy with very strong winds. Not ideal for our sight-seeing! Nonetheless, we left the hotel after breakfast at about 10:30 and began our tour of the sights. The main sight to see here is The Hermitage Museum. We were not going to have enough time to go inside it but the buildings that the museum is housed in are spectacular sights themselves and are well worth seeing. It was about a 2km walk from where we are staying with plenty to see along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Everywhere you look here, the buildings are impressive and it was easy to spend a few hours walking around despite the weather. We walked as far as The Winter Palace which forms part of the Hermitage. We thought about trying to get into the Hermitage but there were long queues to get in. I think long queues are the norm here but the weather was encouraging more people to try and get inside. Standing in the rain did not appeal so we gave up and continued our walking tour. After walking back and fore across the river, we were all cold and wet so had a coffee/hot chocolate stop before climbing the tower of St Isaac's Cathedral for good views of the city.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-042.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back from there to the hotel stopping on the way to reserve a table at Top Hops for the Russia v Spain game at 17:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had about an hour in the hotel before going out. Top Hops was recommended in Lonely Planet and was only about 10 minutes walk from where we are staying. It was by far the best bar we have been in since arriving in Russia. It had a range of 20 draft beers including a wheat beer. It also did very good Mexican food. The Russia game was very enjoyable with a good atmosphere throughout and a lot of very happy Russians at the end. We were going to move back to the Manneken Pis Bar between the two games but after paying the bill, we decided we may as well stay where we were. With the Denmark v Croatia game going to penalties as well it was midnight by the time we left having spent over seven hours in there. We do not remember too much about walking back to the hotel!
