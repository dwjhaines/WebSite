            We said goodbye to Steve at breakfast as he is getting a train back to Moscow this afternoon. We were getting the free train at 21:55 as it saved not only the train fare but a nights accommodation. We checked out of the hotel at midday. Unfortunately the weather was no better than it was yesterday so once again it was not ideal for sight-seeing.

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-043.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent another three hours walking around. We started with the Vladiminsky Cathedral which is close to our hotel. We had seen the Kazan Cathedral a couple of times from the outside but his time went and had a look inside it. We also spent some time looking in souvenir shops, mainly to avoid the rain. When the rain had eased, we continued back to the Winter Palace. This time we crossed the river and spent some time walking around the Peter and Paul Fortress. The wind had eased today so crossing the bridges was not quite as cold and wet as yesterday but we were still in need of a hot chocolate stop by the time we had walked back across the river.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had completed our sight-seeing by about 3:30 and walked back to the area near our hotel. We spent 45 minutes or so in McDonalds. Usually we use McDonalds because it is air-conditioned. This time we wanted somewhere to sit to get out of the cold.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 5.00, we walked to the Manneken Pis Bar to watch the Brazil v Mexico game. Neither of us were keen on drinking after yesterday but we had a drink and something to eat while watching the game. When the game finished, the rain had got a lot heavier. We waited for it to ease again before walking back to the hotel, collecting our luggage and walking to the station. We still had a couple of hours to wait but by the time I had walked to a cashpoint and we had got something to eat, this went fairly quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We boarded the train at about 21:20. This train was very comfortable. We were in a first class sleeping compartment and the train was fairly empty. It was a shame the journey was only eight hours!
            </p>

            We were woken just after 5:00 and the train arrived at Leningradski station an hour later. We had tried last night to book free train tickets to Samara but had again been unsuccessful. As soon as we arrived in Leningradski, we found the FIFA help desk where once again, the volunteers were able to book the tickets for us. We had breakfast at the station and then got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya for our third stay at the Sevastopol Modern.
