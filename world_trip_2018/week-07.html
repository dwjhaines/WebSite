            We said goodbye to Steve at breakfast as he is getting a train back to Moscow this afternoon. We were getting the free train at 21:55 as it saved not only the train fare but a nights accommodation. We checked out of the hotel at midday. Unfortunately the weather was no better than it was yesterday so once again it was not ideal for sight-seeing.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-043.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent another three hours walking around. We started with the Vladiminsky Cathedral which is close to our hotel. We had seen the Kazan Cathedral a couple of times from the outside but his time went and had a look inside it. We also spent some time looking in souvenir shops, mainly to avoid the rain. When the rain had eased, we continued back to the Winter Palace. This time we crossed the river and spent some time walking around the Peter and Paul Fortress. The wind had eased today so crossing the bridges was not quite as cold and wet as yesterday but we were still in need of a hot chocolate stop by the time we had walked back across the river.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had completed our sight-seeing by about 3:30 and walked back to the area near our hotel. We spent 45 minutes or so in McDonalds. Usually we use McDonalds because it is air-conditioned. This time we wanted somewhere to sit to get out of the cold.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 5.00, we walked to the Manneken Pis Bar to watch the Brazil v Mexico game. Neither of us were keen on drinking after yesterday but we had a drink and something to eat while watching the game. When the game finished, the rain had got a lot heavier. We waited for it to ease again before walking back to the hotel, collecting our luggage and walking to the station. We still had a couple of hours to wait but by the time I had walked to a cashpoint and we had got something to eat, this went fairly quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We boarded the train at about 21:20. This train was very comfortable. We were in a first class sleeping compartment and the train was fairly empty. It was a shame the journey was only eight hours! Saint Petersburg has been an excellent place to visit even if it was just for a couple of days. It really is an incredible city to wander around. It would have been better if the weather had not been so bad but apart from that it has been a really enjoyable couple of days here.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 3rd July - 21:00 Colombia v England</span>
            We were woken just after 5:00 and the train arrived at Leningradski station an hour later. We had tried last night to book free train tickets to Samara but had again been unsuccessful. As soon as we arrived in Leningradski, we found the FIFA help desk where once again, the volunteers were able to book the tickets for us. I don't know why everything works on their computers but not on mine. I enter the exact same information but am still not able to book tickets. We had breakfast at the station and then got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya for our third stay at the Sevastopol Modern.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the hotel by 8:00 but could not check in until midday. We did not have anything we particularly wanted to do so spent the four hours sat on the settees in reception. This was a comfortable place to sit and we were able to use the Wi-Fi, sort out photos, etc. We saw Steve who had stayed here last night and arranged to meet him in central Moscow later. We checked in at midday, had showers and got a Metro back into the centre. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got off the Metro at Arbatskaya and walked to a brewery that was recommended in Lonely Planet. The beer here was OK but the place was not great so we left after one drink and continued to walk along Arbat Street, one of the main areas of Moscow for bars and restaurants. We spotted a craft beer pub (Balalayechnaya or Балалаечная) along here and decided to stop for one more before meeting up with the others.... but ended up spending the rest of the afternoon here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Steve and another of his mates, Rich, joined us there and we were not really sure what happened to Steve and Fred. We had assumed that Steve would have made arrangements for us all to meet up but it seems that no plans were made so we stayed where we were. This was another good bar with a large range of craft beers. They also did good burgers so we ate in there while watching the Sweden v Switzerland game. This game was not too exciting so we left before the end and started making our way to the Spartak Stadium. This involved a few changes on the Metro and a 15 minute walk and we got there by about 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Everywhere we went today, the English have been vastly outnumbered by Colombians and the ground was no different. Various estimates were that there were 35,000 Colombians and only 1,500 of us. Not sure how accurate these figures were but they did not seem too unrealistic. Despite the numbers, the atmosphere in the England end was good as the game started.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-045.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was excellent and probably the best we have been to in all the time we have been watching England. Certainly the most exciting. One of Football365's reporters described the emotions during the game as happiness, worry, despair, sorrow, hope, resignation, acceptance, hope again and eventual glory. I'm not sure that getting to the quarter finals counts as glory but it certainly felt like it as the final penalty went in. The England fans remained where they were singing for about 20 - 30 minutes after the last penalty. We nearly always try and get away from grounds as soon as possible after the final whistle but no-one wanted to leave. We have not seen anything like it in all the tournaments we have been to before. The only time we have seen England get to a World Cup quarter final before was via a pretty poor 1 - 0 win against Ecuador. There really was no comparison to tonight's game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We eventually left the ground well after midnight. The Metro was still running predictably efficiently and we were back at Sevastopolskaya sometime after 1:00. ToDaSyo, the bar we were in last week is open 24 hours a day and was still doing its 2 for 1 beer offer so we went for a couple of drinks and something to eat in there with Steve and Rich. Not sure exactly what time we left there but it was starting to get light again!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 4th July</span>
            Steve had left early to fly back to England but we met Rich at breakfast at about 9:30. The restaurant was full of Colombians who unfortunately had to have their breakfast while multiple TV screens showed a complete re-run of last nights game. I don't think I would have been able to cope with eating in there if the positions had been reversed. As it was, the three of us could sit enjoying our breakfasts while discussing plans for the next round(s).
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-046.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We said goodbye to Rich who also flies home today and returned to the room to watch the second half, extra time and the penalties before checking out at midday. We also booked a couple more hotels for the next week. We will now almost certainly stay in Russia until a week on Friday even if we get knocked out on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We left our luggage at the hotel and got the Metro to the stop just the other side of the river to The Kremlin and Red Square. Walking across the river gives excellent views of The Kremiln and St Basil's Cathedral. We continued walking through Red Square and started going round the back of The Kremiln until once again heavy rain forced us to shelter in McDonalds. Once the rain had eased, we continued our walk completing the loop by crossing the river on the next bridge along and returning to the same Metro station. We got the Metro back to the hotel, picked up our luggage and then the Metro again to Kazanskaya station for our next overnight train journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were booked on the 18:08 train to Samara where we will play Sweden on Saturday. We had an hour or so to kill before boarding the train at 5:30. We were back to 2nd class this time but it really didn't matter. There were only a handful of people in our carriage and we had a four person compartment to ourselves. It was as good as being in 1st class apart from having to make our own beds! We were both worn out having been awake for more than 22 hours yesterday so were asleep before 10:00.
