            We said goodbye to Steve at breakfast as he is getting a train back to Moscow this afternoon. We were getting the free train at 21:55 as it saved not only the train fare but a nights accommodation. We checked out of the hotel at midday. Unfortunately the weather was no better than it was yesterday so once again it was not ideal for sight-seeing.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-043.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent another three hours walking around. We started with the Vladiminsky Cathedral which is close to our hotel. We had seen the Kazan Cathedral a couple of times from the outside but his time went and had a look inside it. We also spent some time looking in souvenir shops, mainly to avoid the rain. When the rain had eased, we continued back to the Winter Palace. This time we crossed the river and spent some time walking around the Peter and Paul Fortress. The wind had eased today so crossing the bridges was not quite as cold and wet as yesterday but we were still in need of a hot chocolate stop by the time we had walked back across the river.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had completed our sight-seeing by about 3:30 and walked back to the area near our hotel. We spent 45 minutes or so in McDonalds. Usually we use McDonalds because it is air-conditioned. This time we wanted somewhere to sit to get out of the cold.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 5.00, we walked to the Manneken Pis Bar to watch the Brazil v Mexico game. Neither of us were keen on drinking after yesterday but we had a drink and something to eat while watching the game. When the game finished, the rain had got a lot heavier. We waited for it to ease again before walking back to the hotel, collecting our luggage and walking to the station. We still had a couple of hours to wait but by the time I had walked to a cashpoint and we had got something to eat, this went fairly quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We boarded the train at about 21:20. This train was very comfortable. We were in a first class sleeping compartment and the train was fairly empty. It was a shame the journey was only eight hours! Saint Petersburg has been an excellent place to visit even if it was just for a couple of days. It really is an incredible city to wander around. It would have been better if the weather had not been so bad but apart from that it has been a really enjoyable couple of days here.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-044.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 3rd July - 21:00 Colombia v England</span>
            We were woken just after 5:00 and the train arrived at Leningradski station an hour later. We had tried last night to book free train tickets to Samara but had again been unsuccessful. As soon as we arrived in Leningradski, we found the FIFA help desk where once again, the volunteers were able to book the tickets for us. I don't know why everything works on their computers but not on mine. I enter the exact same information but am still not able to book tickets. We had breakfast at the station and then got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya for our third stay at the Sevastopol Modern.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the hotel by 8:00 but could not check in until midday. We did not have anything we particularly wanted to do so spent the four hours sat on the settees in reception. This was a comfortable place to sit and we were able to use the Wi-Fi, sort out photos, etc. We saw Steve who had stayed here last night and arranged to meet him in central Moscow later. We checked in at midday, had showers and got a Metro back into the centre. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got off the Metro at Arbatskaya and walked to a brewery that was recommended in Lonely Planet. The beer here was OK but the place was not great so we left after one drink and continued to walk along Arbat Street, one of the main areas of Moscow for bars and restaurants. We spotted a craft beer pub (Balalayechnaya or Балалаечная) along here and decided to stop for one more before meeting up with the others.... but ended up spending the rest of the afternoon here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Steve and another of his mates, Rich, joined us there and we were not really sure what happened to Steve and Fred. We had assumed that Steve would have made arrangements for us all to meet up but it seems that no plans were made so we stayed where we were. This was another good bar with a large range of craft beers. They also did good burgers so we ate in there while watching the Sweden v Switzerland game. This game was not too exciting so we left before the end and started making our way to the Spartak Stadium. This involved a few changes on the Metro and a 15 minute walk and we got there by about 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Everywhere we went today, the English have been vastly outnumbered by Colombians and the ground was no different. Various estimates were that there were 35,000 Colombians and only 1,500 of us. Not sure how accurate these figures were but they did not seem too unrealistic. Despite the numbers, the atmosphere in the England end was good as the game started.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-045.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was excellent and probably the best we have been to in all the time we have been watching England. Certainly the most exciting. One of Football365's reporters described the emotions during the game as happiness, worry, despair, sorrow, hope, resignation, acceptance, hope again and eventual glory. I'm not sure that getting to the quarter finals counts as glory but it certainly felt like it as the final penalty went in. The England fans remained where they were singing for about 20 - 30 minutes after the last penalty. We nearly always try and get away from grounds as soon as possible after the final whistle but no-one wanted to leave. We have not seen anything like it in all the tournaments we have been to before. The only time we have seen England get to a World Cup quarter final before was via a pretty poor 1 - 0 win against Ecuador. There really was no comparison to tonight's game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We eventually left the ground well after midnight. The Metro was still running predictably efficiently and we were back at Sevastopolskaya sometime after 1:00. ToDaSyo, the bar we were in last week is open 24 hours a day and was still doing its 2 for 1 beer offer so we went for a couple of drinks and something to eat in there with Steve and Rich. Not sure exactly what time we left there but it was starting to get light again!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 4th July</span>
            Steve had left early to fly back to England but we met Rich at breakfast at about 9:30. The restaurant was full of Colombians who unfortunately had to have their breakfast while multiple TV screens showed a complete re-run of last nights game. I don't think I would have been able to cope with eating in there if the positions had been reversed. As it was, the three of us could sit enjoying our breakfasts while discussing plans for the next round(s).
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-046.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We said goodbye to Rich who also flies home today and returned to the room to watch the second half, extra time and the penalties before checking out at midday. We also booked a couple more hotels for the next week. We will now almost certainly stay in Russia until a week on Friday even if we get knocked out on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We left our luggage at the hotel and got the Metro to the stop just the other side of the river to The Kremlin and Red Square. Walking across the river gives excellent views of The Kremiln and St Basil's Cathedral. We continued walking through Red Square and started going round the back of The Kremiln until once again heavy rain forced us to shelter in McDonalds. Once the rain had eased, we continued our walk completing the loop by crossing the river on the next bridge along and returning to the same Metro station. We got the Metro back to the hotel, picked up our luggage and then the Metro again to Kazanskaya station for our next overnight train journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were booked on the 18:08 train to Samara where we will play Sweden on Saturday. We had an hour or so to kill before boarding the train at 5:30. We were back to 2nd class this time but it really didn't matter. There were only a handful of people in our carriage and we had a four person compartment to ourselves. It was as good as being in 1st class apart from having to make our own beds! We were both worn out having been awake for more than 22 hours yesterday so were asleep before 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 5th July</span>
            We arrived in Samara an hour later than expected, just before 10:00. The train was not late but Samara is an hour ahead of Moscow and the whole railway network runs on Moscow time. We walked to the hotel which was only 500m away and were able to check into a room straight away. We are staying in a Hampton by Hilton again but as with Volgograd, it is not available the day before or the day of the game so we are only here for one night. We are in another hotel for two nights and then back here again on Sunday when the price goes back to normal. There is not a huge amount to see and do in Samara but the availability of the trains meant that we are here for four nights. This does not work out too badly as we have been doing a lot in the last couple of weeks and are in need of a few days of not doing a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">One thing we did have to do was collect our tickets for the Sweden game. This involved a taxi out to a shopping centre about 5 or 6 miles away where FIFA had decided to place their ticketing centre for no obvious reason. We got our tickets easily and were once again offered other tickets by people trying to sell them. We were offered tickets at least four times yesterday by Colombians who are going home. There could be a lot of empty seats on Saturday.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-047.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We got a taxi back to the hotel, had lunch in the room and spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on sleep. We went out for a walk at 6ish. The two main attractions of Samara are the beach and the brewery, both on the banks of The Volga. The river was a mile or so walk from our hotel. We walked past the main square which may have been quite spectacular if it were not totally filled by the fan fest.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            The beach by the river was nicer than we had expected and also more crowded. We walked along the esplanade until it ended and then went a bit further along the road to the Zhiguli brewery. This is one of the most famous breweries in Russia. It was an excellent place and we ended up staying in there until it closed at 2:00. Although there was no football on tonight, the place was full of fans, mostly Russian or Swedish but a few English as well. The atmosphere was good and again, the locals were very friendly and keen to talk to us. The beer was cheap and as good as any we have had in Russia so all in all, a very good night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 6th July</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at midday and got a taxi to The Volga Hotel, a big, soviet style hotel on the river a short walk from the brewery. This was not quite as nice as last nights accommodation and we were back to having a room with no air-con. It is also very noisy as it is on a main road and we need to have the window open. Again, it will be fine for a couple of nights.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-048.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out for a walk again at 2ish. Despite there not being a lot to see, there are a few churches and monuments dotted around the town. We walked down to the beach again before going back up the hill to the Monument of Glory which is just behind the hotel. From there we went across to Glory Square to see the eternal flame. We headed towards the fan fest and collected our Free Lions on the way. We walked around the square had a take-away for lunch which we ate in a park and then walked back to the hotel, stopping on the way to see "the only monument in the world made in honor of the heating radiator". Exciting stuff!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go back to the brewery for the start of the football but ended up watching the first half of France v Uruguay in the room before going out at half time. The brewery was not as full as we had expected it to be when we got there so we were able to sit at the same table that we were at last night. I think a lot of people were at the fan fest. We met up with John again, an England fan who had been with us for quite a lot of time yesterday. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed in the brewery to watch the Belgium v Brazil game but left as soon as it finished. A slightly earlier and more sober night than yesterday!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 7th July - 21:00 Sweden v England</span>
            Spent the morning at the hotel. It was much cooler than expected when we woke but the temperature rose quickly and it was hotter and more humid by about 10:00. Joe turned up to collect Steve's ticket at about 11:20 and we went out for the day about 30 minutes later.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-049.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the brewery as there did not seem much point drinking anywhere else. It was already quite busy when we got there but we got a table and stayed in there for a couple of hours. We walked from there up the hill to where the shuttle buses depart from stopping for one more drink on the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The ground in Samara is about 11 miles away so we just about had to use the shuttle buses. As usual, there was no queuing so we were straight onto a bus and at the ground about 45 minutes later. It was a 10 minute walk from where the buses dropped us and after getting through all the security checks we were in the ground about an hour before kick-off. We got ourselves another beer and went straight into our seats. I was sat in block 113, Row 13, Seat 13 which was not good for the confidence!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This game was a lot less stressful than Tuesday's had been and in the end, it was a relatively comfortable win. The atmosphere in the England end was excellent again and the win meant we were in our first World Cup semi-final for 28 years. We stayed around at the end for 10 minutes or so but wanted to get back into Samara for the Russia v Croatia game which kicked off at 10pm local time. There were loads of buses going back so again there was no queuing and we were back in the brewery by 9:30 still not really able to believe that England were in the semi-final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had another really good night in the brewery. It was totally packed when we got in there and I had to queue for about 20 - 30 minutes to get the first round of drinks. We did not have a table but were sat on a window sill from where we could just about see the TV's. 90% of the people in there were Russian and a lot of them had been drinking all day so the atmosphere was quite lively. We were joined by John again so could take it turns to join the bar queue.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-050.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The game was quite exciting again. Although trying to support Russia, we were all pleased to see Croatia go through as we think that playing Croatia gives England a better chance of reaching the final. The crowd will be a lot less hostile and England fans could actually outnumber the opposition for the first time in the tournament.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            The Russians surprisingly did not seem that upset with their defeat. I think their performance in the tournament has far exceeded their expectations and they were happy to have got as far as they did. Everyone remained friendly and they were all wishing us luck in the next round as they left. Most of the crowd left as soon as the game was over. We ended up sat at a table with some other England fans and a few Russians and stayed there until the place closed at 2am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 8th July</span>
            Checked out of the hotel at midday and got a taxi back to the Hampton by Hilton which is now back down to about £30 a night. We do not have a lot to do for the next 24 hours before our train back to Moscow. We decided that we would go and pick up our semi-final tickets. This was not really necessary as it would be easier to get them when we are in Moscow but we were both keen to get hold of the tickets and we had nothing better to do!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a slightly worrying moment at the ticketing centre. For the previous rounds, we had just put my credit card into the self-service machine and it had  printed out our tickets. This time, it told us we had "No tickets to collect". We still don't know what the problem was but we went to one of the desks and they were able to print the tickets out for us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got a taxi back to the hotel, had lunch in the room and went to sleep for the rest of the afternoon. When we had woken up this morning, we worked out that we had been in Samara for 72 hours and had spent about 25% of that time in the brewery. We were both in need of sleep and a couple of days with no beer!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did walk back to the brewery in the evening - not for a drink, we wanted to buy t-shirts. Roz was able to get one but there were none in my size. We should really have been given free ones the amount of time we have spent in there the last few days! We walked back from there a different route to usual through a pedestrianised shopping area stopping at a fast food place for a pizza on the way. We were back in the room by 10:00 and had a relatively early night.
