            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 6th August</span>
            A slightly more productive day today. After breakfast, I walked to the supermarket to get a few things we needed for today and tomorrow. It is only 2.5 miles away but as with everywhere else around here, it involves a lot of walking up hills so was quite hard work.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The rest of the day was spent mainly on the terrace but also continuing to look into options for Christmas, New Year and the first couple of months of next year. Nothing booked yet but we seem to be getting some sort of plan together. I spent an hour or so arguing with BT about the price of our broadband but did eventually get that sorted out with less hassle than I was expecting.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went for a walk down to the beach again at about 4:30. The beach was starting to look better with calmer sea and better weather although most of it was in the shade by the time we got there. Again, we spent about 30 minutes there before walking back up the hill - a slightly easier walk this time as it was getting cooler. We had our final evening meal on the terrace and a relatively early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th August</span>
            After a final morning on the terrace, we left Tsagarada just before midday. We drove back down to Volos. It was about a 40 mile journey which was a bit slow again but not too bad. As Tsagarada is the furthest from home that the car will go, this was the start of it's journey home.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-075.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were staying a few miles the other side of Volos at a beach called Alykes. Volos is the port from where the ferries depart for the islands that we will be visiting in the next 10 days or so. We had booked a room at Hotel Stella for tonight and the night we get back and plan to leave the car here while we are away. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was a bit of confusion about the car parking as they did not seem to be expecting us to leave the car there and they were a bit surprised when I asked them to book us a taxi to the port tomorrow. However, I was eventually able to leave it in a locked up garden type area near the hotel where it should be fine until we get back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had to go back into Volos to collect our ferry tickets for tomorrow so went in on our bikes at 4ish. There was a mainly flat, five mile cycle path all the way in to the port and we got our tickets without any problems. We also picked up a five litre box of wine to take with us as things are cheaper on the mainland than they will be on the islands
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After cycling back and sorting out our luggage for tomorrow, we went out to eat in the evening for the first time in nearly a week. We found a nice ouzerie/taverna on the seafront and had an excellent meal with a few bottles of the local wine. We also tried Tsipouro for the first time in over 30 years. A very enjoyable evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 8th August</span>
            Our taxi turned up at exactly 7:15 and we were at the port 10 minutes later. We bought breakfast to take on the ferry which left just about on time at 8:15. We were going to Glossa on Skopolos. We are meeting Hoggy and Sarah in Skopolos Town on Saturday and decided to have three nights at Glossa, the other end of the island, before they get here. We sat inside the air-conditioned part of the ferry and apart from a few screaming kids, it was a fairly comfortable four hour journey with one stop at Skiathos on the way. We arrived at Glossa just after midday and walked along the coast to our hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Our hotel is on a hill over looking the harbour that we had just come into. We walked along to the steps leading up to it but were stopped from walking up by a traditional old Greek woman who insisted on getting her son to drive down and pick us up instead (the family own the hotel). We have another studio apartment with a balcony with an excellent view of the harbour.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-076.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After checking in, we walked back down to buy bread for lunch which we ate on the balcony. After eating, we spent an hour or so booking things that we had decided on in the last few days. We already have flights booked to Indonesia in November. We will now leave Indonesia just before Christmas, spend Christmas in Bangkok and then head out to The Philippines for New Year. We booked the flight out to Bangkok and a couple of hotels that we will stay in at Kuta and Bangkok.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we had had enough of doing this, we walked down to Loutraki beach which is just the other side of the harbour. Although stoney, this was a nice beach with not too many people on it and the sea was lovely for swimming in. I stayed an hour or so before returning to the hotel.  Roz stayed for another hour before coming back and booking our return flights from The Philippines.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at a cafe/restaurant near to the hotel. We had thought that we would have to walk up the hill to Glossa town to eat in the evenings but there are a few places around the harbour with nice views. Both had pasta for a change and, after a short walk around the harbour, it was back to the hotel for an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 9th August</span>
            We were up by 7:00 and went out almost straight away. We wanted to walk to Agios Ioannis on the other side of the island. Roz was keen on going here because it is where a lot of Mama Mia was filmed. I think this is one of the worst films I have ever seen but it is a spectacular setting and I was keen on the walk. About the only transport to get there is by taxi or on some sort of organised Mama Mia tour. Walking seemed like the best option. We wanted to go early in an attempt to get there and back before the hottest part of the day (and to try and get there  before the bus loads of Mama Mia fans arrived).
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-077.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The steepest part of the walk was the mile or so climb from the hotel up to Glossa Town. It was still relatively cool when we did this so it was not too bad. We had breakfast in a cafe in Glossa before the three or four mile walk to Agios Ioannis. This was along a road all the way and was quite easy and scenic. We managed to get to Agios Ioannis before most of the crowds had arrived. We walked the 200 steps up to what now appears to be called the "Mama Mia Chapel" which is a small church built high on a rock linked to the mainland by a causeway of steps. Excellent views all around from the top. We did not bother visiting the beach as it is small and can get crowded and we wanted to start walking back before it got too hot.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The walk back was a bit more of a challenge! Although a less steep climb, it was still steep in places and it was starting to get very hot. We made it back to the hotel by about 12:30 after walking just over 11 miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the room but did not do much for the rest of the afternoon. We went down to the beach again just after 5:00. It is too hot for me to go much earlier. Had about 30 minutes of swimming and 30 minutes in the sun before walking back to the hotel. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few glasses of wine on the balcony before walking to a restaurant the other side of the harbour. We had looked at a few menus yesterday and thought this was the nicest of the them. We had to wait for a table but eventually got one right over the sea. Superb location and another very good meal. Had a few more drinks when we got back and got to bed sometime around 1:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 10th August</span>
            Did not wake up until 10:00. I walked down to the bakery to get bread for breakfast which we ate on the balcony. Spent the next few hours lazing around the room/balcony not really doing much. We were both tired after yesterday's walk so not quite so much activity today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went to the beach again at 5:00. Spent a bit longer there today although the sea was rougher and not so good for swimming.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a similar evening to yesterday and returned to Flisvos Taverna. Another very good meal. Slightly less wine tonight and in bed by about midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th August</span>
            Did not leave the room until we checked out at 11:00. After checking out, we walked down to the bus stop at the port and had breakfast while waiting for the 12:00 bus to Skopolos Town. The bus journey was a spectacular 75 minute drive the length of the island giving excellent views of the coast along the way. The route was quite hilly so we spent a lot of the time looking down at bays and beaches.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got into Skopolos just after 1:15 and had a walk of about 50m to The Dolphin Hotel where we were booked into for the next three nights. We had an hour or so by the pool and met Hoggy and Sarah who arrived as we were heading off for lunch. We went out for take-away kebabs which we ate opposite the bus station and then walked to the supermarket to get provisions for tonight. We had another hour or so by the pool before returning to the room to follow the afternoon's football (Swansea 1 - Preston 0, Luton 1 - Sunderland 1).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went round to Hoggy and Sarah's room after the football had finished at 7:00 as they have the bigger balcony. We had a few drinks before going out at about 9:00. We had another round of drinks at an ouzerie type place near the port and then carried on drinking at a taverna. We did not really get round to eating a meal but had snacks with the drinks instead. Not really sure what time we got back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-078.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th August</span>
            Had breakfast and went back to sleep for an hour before making it to the pool by about 11:00. Roz and I stayed by the pool until lunchtime while Hoggy and Sarah went off to look at bus times to go out and visit beaches. We had take-aways for lunch again and spent an hour or so wandering round Skopolos Town which was all quite nice. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the hotel by 4ish and had another hour or so at the pool. We had managed to coincide our visit to Skopolos with the start of "Skopolos Week". This consists of a series of events held in various places around the town. Tonight was "Plums Night" which luckily for us was being held in the ouzerie type place we had been in last night. We had a few drinks on the balcony again and headed out at 8:00 to make sure we got a table.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Plums night seemed to be mainly a promotional evening for a plum and herb liqueur. We did not really know what was going on as it was all in Greek but there was a table set up where they were giving away samples of the drink as well as measures of tsipouro. We got as many of the samples as we could before going back to the taverna for a meal (I don't know why we got as many samples as we did as neither drink was particularly nice).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The ouzerie was closed by the time we had finished so we returned to the balcony for a few more drinks before bed.
            </p>
