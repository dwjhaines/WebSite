			Monday, 18th June</span> - Slept until 10:30 and met up for breakfast which was 
			included in the price of the room. We checked out at midday and 
			spent an hour or so wandering round the one or two sights of 
			Poltava. It was another nice enough place again without having anything 
			too spectacular to see.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We were back at the hotel by two, collected the car and started 
			driving towards Donetsk. We had booked a hotel for two nights in 
			Yenakievo, about 50km N.E. of Donetsk. The drive took about six 
			hours. This time, we experienced pot-holed roads that were every bit 
			as bad as we had been led to believe! We had decided to let the sat-nav 
			choose the best route and it chose a direct route between two main 
			roads that involved two hours of very rough roads. It was not too 
			bad for driving on but there were a lot of holes that would do 
			serious damage to the car if you hit them at any speed. We will probably 
			choose a different route back! I got stopped for speeding for the 
			second time in two days (84km/h in a 60km/h zone) and went through 
			exactly the same thing as yesterday. After telling me that I would 
			get a ticket, they could not be bothered with the paperwork and told 
			us to go. Lonely Planet had suggested that if you stand around 
			talking to them in English and they do not get their 
			bribe, they will get bored and send you away and this does seem to 
			be the case.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-J_tAi8np4-0/T-KXybo-RFI/AAAAAAAAEl0/DZZpHo6ouco/s320/IMG_1154.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
Our sat-nav did not have any details of Yenakievo so we had to find 
			the hotel ourselves. This involved getting directions in Russian a 
			couple of times but people were very helpful and we got there 
			eventually at about 8:30. First impressions of Yenakievo were not good. It is a 
			very industrial town and looked about as appealing as Port Talbot. 
			The hotel was equally uninviting and grim looking, and Steve was quite keen to leave 
			as soon as possible after being shown to our rooms. However, once 
			again, it is clean enough and will do for a couple of nights. We 
			will not be spending that long in it as we will be in Donetsk all 
			day tomorrow and will leave first thing on Wednesday.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We had a quick look around the town before returning to the cafe 
			attached to the hotel. There were three other England fans in there 
			(they have been in Yenakievo for a week!) and we watched the Spain v Croatia game in there with them. The food 
			was surprisingly good and after a few beers, Yenakievo seemed a much 
			better place!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th June - England v Ukraine</span> - We met up with Steve at 10 and bought breakfast from a 
			supermarket. We ate it in the grounds of the church with lovely 
			views of the steelworks. We had decided not to take the car into 
			Donetsk as it would mean one of us not drinking so we got the hotel 
			to call us a taxi. It was a 50km journey for about £16.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wtFGsGF-f3Q/T-KXx9YbzAI/AAAAAAAAElw/YcfKXQrRJtk/s320/IMG_1158.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
We 
			were dropped in the centre of town and walked out to Pushkin Ave. 
			where most of the bars are and spent a few hours back in the place 
			we spent a lot of time when we were here last week. We met up with Dave 
			and Nick again as well as a couple more of Steve's mates and spent 
			the rest of the afternoon wandering round a few different bars, 
			trying not to drink too quickly due to the late kick-off again. 
			Despite all the reports of potential for crowd trouble, the 
			atmosphere everywhere was pretty good. There were no-where near as 
			many Russians around as there had been for the first game and the 
			Ukrainians seemed much friendlier.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			The three of us left for the ground about an hour before kick-off 
			and got in without any problems. Another enjoyable game saw us 
			comfortably win our group and make it into the quarter finals. We 
			were desperate for England to win the group as coming second would 
			mean a quarter final in Donetsk and a possible semi in Donetsk as 
			well. We have got to quite like Donetsk but the lack of decent 
			accommodation is a real problem. Winning the group means our quarter 
			final is back in Kiev. This probably means about 10 hours less 
			driving and means that we have good accommodation booked for the 
			rest of our time in Ukraine - none of us were particularly keen on 
			having to stay at Hotel Mir again! It also means Mark will fly back 
			out - he would not of come if the quarter final had been in Donetsk.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			After the game, we got a taxi back to Yenakievo (£28 this time) and 
			were back at the hotel just after 1am.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th June - </span>We had breakfast 
			in the hotel cafe before checking out at about 11 and starting to 
			drive towards Dnipropetrovsk. We had chosen to stay here for a 
			couple of nights as it is in between Donetsk and Kiev and would 
			leave us quite well placed whichever of the quarter finals we had 
			ended up in (or if we had been knocked out!). The journey was not 
			too eventful. We had one stop for petrol and one stop by the traffic 
			police. This time it was not for speeding but a standard documents 
			check. Once they realised that we were here for the football they 
			wished us good luck and told us to go.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived in Dnipro at about 3:30 and then spent about 45 minutes 
			trying to get to the apartment. We got to the right address but the 
			person on the end of the contact phone number spoke no English and 
			it took a while to find someone to let us in. Once in, the apartment 
			was again excellent. It is more modern than the one in Kiev, has 
			superb views of the river and is a world away from last night's 
			accommodation. We did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon but 
			started looking into options for Warsaw in case we make it to the 
			semi-final. Went out in the evening for a few beers and something to 
			eat and were back in the apartment by about 10:00. This was the 
			first day of the tournament with no football to watch.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CXQZ5RqeyQs/T-SDJj5lZpI/AAAAAAAAEpw/r03B0VyS1Ac/s320/IMG_1203.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st June - </span>A day with 
			nothing to do, which was quite nice after the&nbsp; last week or so. 
			We spent a lot of the morning trying to get our electric sorted out. 
			Everything went off when the bathroom lights were switched on. This 
			was down to a faulty light-bulb but it took six Ukrainians 
			(including at least two electricians, the owners of the flat, and a 
			student translator) about three hours to get the bulb removed and 
			the electric switched back on. How many Ukrainians does it take to 
			change a light bulb? At least six apparently.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We went out for a couple of hours to see the sights of Dnipro. Two 
			hours was more than enough! It is another pleasant place and it is 
			OK to walk around but there is nothing of any great interest to go 
			and see. Spent most of the day making the most of the apartment. 
			It had a washing machine so we could get all our washing done and we 
			continued to look at options for Warsaw and also for later in 
			our trip. Went out to a local 
			bar in the evening and had a few beers while watching the first 
			quarter final.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd June - </span>Left the apartment 
			at 8:30 for the drive back to Kiev. An uneventful journey, we had no 
			stops for speeding or document checks. We had no idea which route 
			would be the best but the journey took just under 7 hours so 
			probably could not of done it a lot quicker if we had gone another 
			way. The sat-nav seemed very confused at the start of the trip due 
			to new roads that it did not recognise but once in Kiev, it got us 
			back to the apartment very easily. We had booked a different apartment 
			near to the last one that we had here. It is not as nice and is 
			smaller but it is fine for a couple of days and is US$100 a night 
			cheaper. Mark does not arrive until 1:30 on Sunday morning so we do 
			not need as much space anyway.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			Did not do a lot else for the rest of the day. Roz was not feeling 
			that well by the time we got to Kiev and Steve and I were both 
			knackered. We have had a lot of days with either too much driving or 
			too much beer and have not been getting enough sleep We went out to 
			a restaurant just round the corner to eat and returned to the 
			apartment to watch the Germany v Greece game. My second 
			alcohol free day of the tournament.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23rd June - </span>All woke feeling 
			better after a good nights sleep. We left the apartment at about 11 
			and went off to collect our tickets for tomorrow's game. We got the 
			metro to the main square and walked out to the Dynamo Kiev Stadium 
			collecting our Free Lions on the way. There were no queues at the 
			collection point but it was predictably farcical. They photocopied 
			our membership cards which is going to cause long delays tomorrow 
			when lots of people turn up at the same time, and when they did give 
			us our tickets, none of us were sat together. We did complain to the 
			UEFA staff but they were not interested. We also spoke to the two FA 
			officials who were there and they were not happy with UEFA. We were 
			given the option of returning our tickets as they were about to 
			close the collection point and try and reprint the tickets but we 
			decided to stick with what we had. We assume that as with previous 
			games, we will be able to sort it out when we get in the ground. 
			Apparently the FA have only sold 2,000 tickets for this game.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YBTX214jjmU/T-awgBDGgCI/AAAAAAAAEqA/Xu9kdid0oFw/s320/IMG_1215.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">When 
			we left the collection point, we spent 10 - 15 minutes wandering 
			round the Kiev Stadium which was surprisingly small. After taking 
			our photos, we walked out to the Chernobyl museum, about a mile 
			away. There was hardly any information in English for most of the 
			exhibits but it was interesting enough to wander round for an hour 
			or so. This was the last sight we had any interest in seeing in Kiev 
			so we walked from the back to the centre, stopping for lunch on the 
			way. Roz and Steve went back into the fan park so Roz could pick up 
			another programme and we then went back to Kupidon for a drink 
			before walking back to the apartment. By the time we got back to the 
			apartment, we had time for quick showers before heading back to 
			Kupidon for tea and to watch Spain v France. Not too many fans 
			around from either country and&nbsp; the bar was a lot emptier than 
			it had been during the group stages. We got the metro back to the 
			apartment after the game and sat around waiting for Mark to arrive. 
			Despite an emergency stop in Brussels due to another passenger 
			having a heart attack, he arrived on time and was at the apartment 
			just after 2am.</p>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday, 24th June - England v Italy - </span>We checked out of the apartment just after 11. Steve, 
			Roz and I were booked into a hotel near the airport for tonight as 
			we all fly home tomorrow. Mark is flying at 5:30 am so will go 
			straight to the airport after the game. Roz and I took all the 
			luggage out to the airport hotel while Mark and Steve went to 
			collect Mark's ticket. We got out to the hotel without any problems 
			and checked into two rooms before driving back to the airport. The 
			plan was to return the hire car to the airport and then get the bus 
			back into Kiev. However, there was no-one to meet us at the airport 
			and, after a phone call to the office, we were told to take the car 
			back into Kiev. This did not work out too badly for us, as it was a 
			cheaper and quicker way of getting back to the centre of&nbsp; Kiev. We met the 
			manager of the hire company at the metro station near where we had 
			been staying (the office was in the part of Kiev closed off for the 
			football) and by 1:40 were on the metro.
			</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-L6d7c3t-38g/T-nKmu3dU0I/AAAAAAAAEqM/JxET1leF4Wc/s320/IMG_4215.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">We got to Kupidon at 2:00 
			where we met up with Mark and Steve again. We stayed there for a few 
			hours and were joined by Fred and Southend Steve who we know from 
			previous tournaments. At 6ish, we walked from there back to the same 
			place we had been before the Sweden game. Whereas before the Sweden 
			game, we had struggled to get a table, this time we were the only 
			fans in there. There did not seem to be many fans around from either 
			England or Italy as we we went towards the ground and the atmosphere generally before the game was 
			very quiet. After eating, we stopped at one more bar on the way to 
			the ground and were in our seats by 9:30 for another 9:45 kick-off.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The game itself was fairly predictable I suppose. A 0 - 0 draw 
			followed by England going out on penalties. We had low expectations 
			at the start of the tournament and did not think we would be that 
			bothered about how England did. Two weeks ago, the prospect of an 
			early exit and a quick return to Germany seemed quite appealing. 
			Despite this, going out in the quarter finals on penalties felt just 
			as painful as it has done in the past. The tournament is certainly 
			not the best we have been to but it was a lot better than we had 
			expected and getting to a semi-final in Warsaw against the Germans 
			would of been excellent. The fact that we were ahead and then&nbsp; 
			messed it up so quickly seemed to make it even worse.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			We all met up after the game in the same bar we had been in after 
			the Sweden game but no-one was that enthusiastic about drinking. We 
			had a couple of beers and got a taxi out to the airport at about 
			3:15 (the game had not finished until well after midnight). We 
			dropped Mark at the airport and got the taxi to take us to our hotel 
			about 3 miles away. We said goodbye to Steve who was due to leave 
			the hotel again at 7:30 and finally got to bed just after 4.</p>
