                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 11th June</span>
            Much better weather today with the temperatures back up into the mid 30's. Ideal for a 200 mile drive!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We packed up the car, reattached the bikes, said our goodbyes to the owner of the apartment and started heading South at about 9:00. Most of the driving since leaving Austria has been on slow country roads. There have been no direct motorways to the places we have wanted to go to and we have chosen the slow cross-country, direct routes instead of going out of our way to use motorways. Today, most of the driving was on toll motorways. We had a 10 mile journey from Vrdnik to join up with the Belgrade motorway and should have then been on the same road all the way to Niš.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This road deteriorated a bit round Belgrade either due to roadworks or parts of it not being built yet, despite our atlas showing it as completed. We then missed a turning to rejoin the motorway, again due to the Cyrillic alphabet. We had been following signs for Niš when we saw a turning to Ниш. The Cyrillic alphabet is not that complicated once you get used to it and you do start recognising words, particularly place names, but by the time we had worked out that this was Niš, we were past the turning and on a 10 mile detour towards the centre of Belgrade.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once we had corrected this and were South of Belgrade, the remaining 140 miles or so were very quick. There is an 80 mph speed limit on the motorways and very little other traffic. We had to pay a total of RSD 930 (about £7) in tolls which was good value for the quality of the roads. We had a couple of stops on the way down and were in the area by the apartments by about 14:00. We were not really sure how to get into the apartment building so we parked at the nearby football stadium and I waited with the car while Roz went to find the owner. He showed us to the private car park behind the apartments which is ideal for a couple of days. We have another studio apartment - this one with air-conditioning which felt good after a few days without.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-023.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out again at about 4:00. Niš does not have a huge amount of sights. After a lot of research, the place that seemed the most interesting to visit was the Ministarstvo (Министарство) Beer Bar. However, there are a few other things to see. The skull tower does not open on Mondays so we headed instead towards the fortress which is just North of the centre. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Conveniently, the beer bar was on the way so we stopped there for a drink. This was an excellent place with a large range of beers from around the world. We had a wheat beer each before continuing to the fortress. This tasted very good as we have not had decent beer since leaving Austria.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The fortress was not too spectacular but had a few places to sit and eat or drink. The place that our guide book recommended to eat in had closed but we found one other place for a drink before walking round the rest of the area. Most of the other bars were expensive trendy type places so we left the fortress and walked back through the town. We did not find anywhere else we particularly liked for a drink so we ended up back at Ministarstvo.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed there for a few more beers and had a very good meal of the local sausages with bread and spicy potatoes. We found another nice looking restaurant on the way home that sold the local beer for less than £1 a bottle so stayed in there until it closed just before midnight.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 12th June</span>
            Had a late breakfast in the apartment and went out to see the skull tower just after midday. We started our sightseeing by walking round the football stadium that is just over the road from where we are staying. A few of the gates were open so we were able to go in for photos but it was nothing too spectacular. The skull tower was about a one mile walk in the opposite direction to the town centre. It is a stone structure embedded with human skulls that was built in 1809, during the First Serbian Uprising and is now enclosed in a small church type building.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            There seem to be a few different versions of exactly how or why it was built but apparently it is a monument to "Turkish Barbarism and Serbian Courage". It used to be totally covered with skulls but now there are just 54 remaining. Not as good as some of the skull churches we have seen in Portugal! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We walked back from there via a church which is another of the main things to see here but as with the other sights, it was not particularly impressive. We walked back to the apartment stopping for take-away burger type things for lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been thinking of going out on our bikes again but when we had been walking round the football stadium this morning, we had seen a swimming pool just behind it and this seemed a better idea. We bought our tickets and went in and were surprised to find some sort of swimming pool complex with an olympic size pool, two other pools as well as slides, etc. There were also hundreds of people there, mainly sun-bathing around the edges of the pools. The biggest pool was not too busy so we were able to swim up and down it without too many problems. I swam a mile before giving up. Roz carried on after I had left.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to Ministarstvo in the evening for a couple of beers before going to eat. We ate at the same restaurant we had ended up in last night. The food had looked good while we were in there and once again we had superb meals with a couple of litres of wine. We both had the Karađorđeva šnicla, another Serbian specialty - veal in breadcrumbs stuffed with cheese.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Niš has been an excellent place to stay. We chose to stay here because of its location on our journey South as opposed to it having a huge selection of things to see. Despite the lack of sights, it has been a nice place to wander round and will be remembered for the very good food and drink.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 13th June</span>
            Checked out of the apartment at 10:30 to begin the final leg of this part of the trip, a 130 mile drive to Skopje. Again the driving was easy enough once we had got out of Niš as It was toll motorway most of the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The Serbian/Macedonian border was also very easy to get through. At both sides there was a short queue but no-one was particularly interested in the car or our passports. Once through the Macedonian side, we had to stop to buy car insurance. This is the first country that is not covered by my UK insurance and we knew we would have to pay it. The insurance cost €50 for 15 days and we had to pay twice - once for the next couple of days and once for when we get back form Moscow. It seemed expensive for such a short period but we knew this in advance and it is the first additional expense we have had on the way down.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">From the border, it was only about 25 miles into Skopje. We found the apartment we had booked and had checked in by about 2:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent a couple of hours in the room sorting out emails, etc while watching a violent thunderstorm outside. It was an hour or so of torrential rain and some of the biggest hailstones I have ever seen.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The storm had cleared by 5:00 so we walked into the centre to see the sights. The place we are staying is only about a 10 minute walk along the river to the centre of town.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-025.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The centre of town is quite a bizarre place. I was here in 2006 and it has changed beyond all recognition since then. <i>" A highly controversial urban project, "Skopje 2014", was adopted by the municipal authorities in order to give the city a more monumental and historical aspect, and thus to transform it into a proper national capital."</i> The result of this is a lot of buildings that look as if they are part of a film set or a Las Vegas hotel complex. The whole area has also been "enhanced" by giant warrior statues, elaborate fountains and a lot more ornate bridges than are entirely necessary. Although slightly odd looking, it was quite entertaining to wander around for an hour or so and there are plenty of things to photograph.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked across The Stone Bridge to get into the old town which was less developed and more recognisable from 12 years ago. We walked through the town and up to the fort which although not that spectacular itself, gave good views of the city below. From there we walked back into the old town passing the mosque that just about completed our sight-seeing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was time to eat by now and about the best looking place we had seen was The Old Town Brewery at the top end of the town. We went there for a few beers and another meal of  Ćevapi, spicy sausages, bread and salad.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the apartment along the river and sat in the garden finishing the last of our bottles of wine from Tesco before having a relatively early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 14th June</span>
            We had breakfast and stayed in the apartment until checkout at 11:00. We did not have too much to do today apart from waiting for our flight to Moscow at 4:30 tomorrow morning.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-026.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We packed up the car and left it outside the apartments for a couple of hours while we went out on our bikes. There was a cycle path that went for about 5 miles along the river so we followed that until it came to an end. Back in town, we cycled around the football stadium which is very close to the centre. As with just about all Eastern European grounds we have been to, there was an open gate that anyone could wander through so we were able to get inside for photos. This had also changed beyond recognition since I saw England here in 2006.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The last sight on our list was the tribute to Mother Theresa who apparently was born in Skopje. Predictably, this was not as interesting as the football stadium.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We cycled back to the apartment, attached the bikes to the car and drove out to the airport motel where we will leave the car for the next four weeks. This  completed our driving for this leg of the trip - a total distance of 1862 miles from Kingsclere! We were a bit unsure about how safe it would be to leave the car here but it really could not have worked out much better. It is in a car park behind the motel in a very quiet area. There is also a large garage which our bikes are locked up in. It is about as good as we could have hoped for. The receptionist was very helpful with everything and also booked us taxis for tomorrow and for four weeks time when we return.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent the next hour or so sorting out our luggage. For the last three weeks we have had everything in the boot of the car but needed to sort out what we were taking with us and what we were leaving here. By the time we had done this and had showers, it was almost 5:00..... nearly time for kick-off in the opening game, Russia v Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was not a lot around the motel but we continued walking along the road we had driven in on and got to the village after about 10 minutes. We found a cafe/bar to watch the match. Not the greatest of bars but at least we did get to see the game. We walked from there a few minutes further and found another better restaurant. This was surprisingly packed given that it was early on a Thursday evening but we got a table and had a similar meal to last nights (meat and salad). We also had a couple of litres of wine which may not have been the best of ideas given the time of our flight tomorrow, but the food and drink here, as with Serbia, have been excellent and it was another very good evening. We walked back to the motel after eating and were in bed just after 10:00.
            </p>
