            Today, we did a repeat of the three dives that we did on Saturday. All three dives were good again although we did not have the lengthy turtle encounters today so overall the dives not as good. We did add to our list of macro sightings with a ribbon eel on the first dive, a leaf scorpion fish on the second and a tiny pegasus sea-moth on the third. We did see one hawksbill turtle on the second dive but this was a brief sighting as it was swimming quickly into the current and it was not possible to swim with it for long.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Although the diving with Eco Dive has not been as cheap as at Cafe Garam, it has been incredibly good value for what we have done. The bill for our diving came to Rp1,400,000 or Â£76 for six dives each. The only reason it cost more is because for four of the dives, we have had to hire a boat to take us to the dive sites instead of just walking in from the beach. We are thinking about coming back here in February as the diving is so much cheaper than in Thailand but we were told today that February is not a good month here due to the weather so we may have another re-think about that idea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the room just after 4pm and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from a trip to the shop and another unsuccessful attempt to get money out of the ATM. We ate at Bamboo Bali again in the evening.
