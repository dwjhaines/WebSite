            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 10th December</span>
            Today, we did a repeat of the three dives that we did on Saturday. All three dives were good again although we did not have the lengthy turtle encounters today so overall the dives not as good. We did add to our list of macro sightings with a ribbon eel on the first dive, a leaf scorpion fish on the second and a tiny pegasus sea-moth on the third. We did see one hawksbill turtle on the second dive but this was a brief sighting as it was swimming quickly into the current and it was not possible to swim with it for long.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Although the diving with Eco Dive has not been as cheap as at Cafe Garam, it has been incredibly good value for what we have done. The bill for our diving came to Rp1,400,000 or Â£76 for six dives each. The only reason it cost more is because for four of the dives, we have had to hire a boat to take us to the dive sites instead of just walking in from the beach. We are thinking about coming back here in February as the diving is so much cheaper than in Thailand but we were told today that February is not a good month here due to the weather so we may have another re-think about that idea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the room just after 4pm and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from a trip to the shop and another unsuccessful attempt to get money out of the ATM. We ate at Bamboo Bali again in the evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 11th December</span>
            Today we had planned to do two similar dives to the ones that we did at Cafe Garam last Friday. However, we walked to the dive center to be told that they had no tanks available. It is low season here at the moment and there are not many people around so how a dive centre could not have any tanks is difficult to comprehend. They did direct us to another operator, Amed Zen Diving, about 100m along the road and this did not work out too badly. It meant that we were entering the water slightly further East than planned but this did not really matter and the staff at the dive centre were more friendly and helpful than at Cafe Garam
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-163.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Both dives were very good again. On the first we managed to find a small frog fish within a few meters of the entry point. We swam from there back to the cleaning station that we had been to from Cafe Garam. Just about the whole dive was on black sand and there was just about enough to see to keep the dive interesting. For the second dive, we went in a bit closer to where we went in last week and went back to see the same red frog fish. It was still in roughly the same place (they do not move around much) and we spent about 10 minutes watching it walking across the mooring block that it lives on.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went from the frog fish back down to the cleaning station. After the cleaning station, I found a sea-horse and Roz found the smallest frog fish we have ever seen. It must have been a lot less than 1cm in length and made the one I found earlier look positively large. I have no idea how she managed to spot it. We also re-found the frog fish we had seen on the first dive here. The dive staff had told us that they had seen three frog fish out there yesterday but were surprised when we came back and said that we had managed to find three as well (all different to the ones they had seen). Back at the dive centre, the dive staff washed our gear for us. We paid our bill which was slightly cheaper than last weeks dives and walked back to Ganesh Amed for a late lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After another afternoon of not doing much, we had slightly more drinks than planned in the evening. A similar evening to Saturday i.e. a few drinks on the balcony, we ate at Bamboo Bali for a final time and then back to the balcony to continue working our way through the duty free Bacardi.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 12th December</span>
            We checked out of the room at 11:00 and had half an hour or so to wait for our transfer to Tulamben. It was a journey of about 30 minutes including a stop at an ATM on the way. This time I was able to take out three lots of Rp1,250,000 which will cover us for most of our stay in Tulamben (we are not expecting the Tulamben ATM's to be any more reliable than the ones in Amed).
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">By midday we were dropped at Tulamben Wreck Divers, another place that we have stayed at several times previously. The dive centre had not changed much but the resort has doubled in size with the addition of seven new rooms. We have one of the new upstairs rooms. It is two rooms really as there is a bedroom, a separate living room type area, a balcony overlooking the pool and a total of 21 power points for some reason.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We decided to have a day off diving and will start again tomorrow. We had lunch in the resorts new restaurant and then went for a walk round the village. Spent most of the remainder of the afternoon editing photos or lying by the pool. In the evening we ate out at The Safety Stop. This is a bar/restaurant that we used to eat in when we have stayed in Tulamben before and it had not changed at all since we were last there six years ago. The food here is a step up in quality from what we have been eating and we both had excellent meals before an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th December</span>
            The main reason for staying in Tulamben is to dive the U.S.A.T. Liberty ship wreck. This was an American army transport ship that was torpedoed by the Japanese during World War II and towed to the beach in Bali for unloading. When Mt Agung erupted in 1963, the ship was pushed off the beach and now sits in about 30m of water, a few minutes away from the shore. This is one of the best and easiest wreck dives in the world due to its proximity to the beach and the fact that the top of the wreck is only about 5m deep. We are staying a few minutes walk away from it so can just get up, put our gear together and walk down to the beach.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-164.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The wreck gets very busy during the day usually but staying here gives you the option of diving first thing in the morning and later in the day so that you miss the day-trippers. When we were here six years ago, getting in the water by 6:30 meant that you got to see all the bump-head parrot fish that sleep on the wreck and move off as it starts to get light. When we got up at 6:00 this morning it was already light and by the time we were in the water at 6:30 they had all left. Still had a good 75 minutes on the wreck before returning to the resort for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did our second dive at Coral Garden. This is also only a few minutes walk from where we are staying and is another good site. There are a lot of statues and bits of temples dropped in the water, all with a lot growing on them and attracting a lot of fish. We also saw a hawksbill turtle there. Because of the early start, we had finished the second dive by midday and had a long surface interval before dive three. We did the first half of the dive in the black sand near the wreck before finishing on the wreck itself. The first bump-head had returned to the wreck as we were nearing the end of our dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate in a restaurant a few doors down from where we are staying. Very good, authentically Indonesian chicken schnitzels!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 14th December</span>
            We were up earlier this morning. The dive centre does not open until 6:00 but we were told that if we wanted to dive earlier, the security guard would open up the equipment room for us so we could get our gear. We were up at 5:00, at the dive centre by 5:15 and in the water just after 5:30 (our earliest ever dive).
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-165.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Getting up at that time was worthwhile. Previously when we have seen the bump-heads here, they were mainly gathered round the rudder area of the wreck and stayed there in a large group before moving off. There were none in this area when we arrived but after a few minutes, we started to spot them still sleeping on the wreck. We stayed round about that end of the wreck as more and more of them started waking up and emerging from where they had been sleeping. In all, we had about an hour with them before they all moved off. We have seen bump-heads in other places but nowhere where you can get as close to them as you can here. They will quite often let you get within touching distance before they move off. They are also bigger than the ones we have seen elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive also featured more divers than we have seen for a while. We know the wreck gets busy but there are not usually so many divers around that early. It came as a surprise as Tulamben seems totally empty at the moment. There was only one other diver at our resort on Wednesday and one more couple last night. The restaurants are all empty and the whole area is suffering from the effect of the Mt Agung eruption 14 months ago. We don't really know where all these other people had appeared from.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Coral Garden. We were hoping to see the turtle again but he was not around. This did give us more time around the statues and also more time with four large bump-heads that were hanging around there. Getting in and out of the water here is starting to get more difficult. It is supposed to be bad from mid-December until March and is certainly becoming more of a challenge! The rocks at the entry/exit points are quite difficult to walk over at the best of times and it only needs a slight increase in the size of the waves to make it a lot harder. Only minor cuts and scratches so far!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was our usual evening dive with 40 minutes over the sand and 50 minutes on the wreck. There does not seem to be as much macro stuff to see at the moment. We found a few ribbon eels and there are a lot of peacock mantis shrimps around but not too much else so far. The wreck is still very good though and we still have plenty more of that to look round.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not go to far to eat today. Pot noodles on the balcony for lunch and an average meal in the hotel restaurant in the evening. An early night as we are planning another early start tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th December</span>
            Slightly later start this morning but still in the water by 5:41. This was our 50th dive on the Liberty. We did our first dives here after qualifying and have been back a few times since. This was one of the best dives we have done here. We found bump-heads straight away and although there did not seem to be as many of them this morning, there were also a lot less divers.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-166.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent about an hour with the bump-heads and then a hawksbill turtle appeared through the middle of them. We watched her eating for 10 - 15 minutes while everyone else followed the bump-heads. When the turtle went deeper, we continued round the wreck. The bump-heads stayed later today so were still around and we had a 10 minute encounter with another hawksbill in the middle of the wreck. When that one swam off in the opposite direction, we started making our way back and saw a third hawksbill just as we were leaving the wreck. Because most of the dive had been shallow we managed a 105 minute dive. Not a bad way to start the day!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive after breakfast was at Drop Off, the third of the sites here that is accessible from the beach. This is an easier entry/exit point than the other two as it is in a more sheltered part of the bay. Another good dive without the highlights of the first. As with last time we were here, we saw a few nudibranchs (including a Picachu) and the wall part of the dive was quite spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the resort restaurant and decided it would be the last time we had meals here (apart from breakfast which is included). Last night they forgot one of our meals and today we waited about 35 minutes for plates of fried rice. Both times, we were the only two in the restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did our third dive slightly earlier than usual at 3pm. Instead of starting on the black sand, we went straight to the wreck and went all the way down to the bow section, an area we do not dive so often. Right at the very front of the boat we found one of this mornings turtles so had 15 minutes or so with it before swimming back. A good end to a very good days diving. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The porter system is quite hard to get used to here. When you get back from a dive, you just leave all your equipment lying on the beach and walk back to the dive centre. There is a co-operative system of dive porters and someone will make sure that your tank gets taken back to where-ever it should go. Although it is often easier to carry the gear yourself, this is how a lot of people in the area make a living and carrying your own stuff is definitely not the done thing. The system seems to work but leaving almost a thousand pounds worth of dive equipment lying on a public beach does not seem right.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once our gear was back at the dive centre and washed, we returned to the room for a couple of hours before starting on the beer. We had a couple on the balcony while looking at the days pictures and watching some of our videos. We ate at The Safety Stop and stayed in there until the Man City v Everton game finished. We returned to the room and sat on next doors balcony (it is closer to the restaurant so the WiFi works better) finishing our duty free while following the football. Got to bed sometime around 2am after both Swansea and Sunderland came from behind to win.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 16th December</span>
            We had planned not to dive today. We had been awake for 21 hours yesterday and needed a day to catch up on sleep. Spent most of the day in the room sleeping, reading or editing photos. In the evening we ate at the warung near the dive centre where we had eaten on Thursday. A very enjoyable, relaxing day.
