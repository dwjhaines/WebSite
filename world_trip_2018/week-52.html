            Back to diving today and another four dives. All the dives were good today although it was a slightly frustrating day. We started with our early morning dive on Bari Reef. As always this was a very nice way to start the day but once again, we were unable to find any turtles. The new resident turtle seems a lot less predictable than Turtle 1 was and we have not worked out exactly what she does in the mornings yet. Whatever it is, there was no sign of her today.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-282.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After the first dive we had breakfast and had someone from the office round to open our safe for us so that is that panic over.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to do two dives at Karpata today. This is one of the better sites here but it is further North so a longer drive and can be a difficult entry/exit if the sea is rough. We drove up there but decided that the waves were too big and it was not worth risking. We have had problems getting in and out here before and decided then that if there was any doubt, we would err on the side of caution. Today we agreed to give it a miss. One of the other problems with Karpata is that the road round the island has become one-way by this point so it is a long drive back round to get to an alternative site. This is OK if you have just had a good dive there but is annoying when it has been a wasted journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive we went in at Andrea I and dived both the Andrea sites I & II. When we first came to Bonaire, these sites were some of the best for spotting turtles. We did see one green turtle but it was not a good quality sighting as it was quite a long way away. Dive three was at Oil Slick Leap. This was a site we had done quite a lot in the past but it had not been so good in the last few times we have visited Bonaire. Today, the vis was good and it was a better dive so it is probably back on our list of favoured dive sites. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a slight variation on our evening dive. We entered the water at The Cliff. Instead of going back to where we started, we kept going past Captain Don's and Buddy's and ended up back at Bari Reef. This was an excellent dive but is now a bit sad at the end due to the lack of turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After washing our gear and having showers, I walked back to Hamlet Oasis to collect the car. We had pasta on the balcony again for tea and it was another early night.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 14th May</span>
            Three very good dives today. We headed South again at about 6:30 after collecting tanks and our gear. First dive was at Hilma Hooker and this time we did have the wreck completely to ourselves for the whole dive. We had about an hour on the wreck before having to head for the reef just as the dive boats started arriving. We also had the bonus of an eagle ray at the top of the reef.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Salt Pier. The sea was still rough today meaning getting in and out was harder than usual. It also meant that the sand in the shallows was getting churned up quite a lot so the turtles were harder to find. We still found three on the way out and another couple on the way back and were able to spend quite a bit of time with them. The pier itself was very good again and we had another eagle ray encounter as we were leaving it to look for the turtles again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the dive we were watching other divers going in and out with various degrees of success and decided we needed an easy entry site again. We drove a short distance North to Aquarius which has a sandy entry point and did our third dive here. We have gone out to the second reef on previous dives here but this time stayed on the inner reef. The coral here was very nice and we saw our sixth turtle of the day. All three dives today were quite long again and it was already gone 2pm by the time we were heading back to Sand Dollar so we decided to call it a day and stick with the three dives. We washed our gear, had lunch on the balcony and did not do much for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We cooked tea again, ate on the balcony and were in bed by 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th May</span>
            An excellent days diving today. We were up at 6:00, collected our gear and tanks and drove South again. First dive was at Angel City. We went out to the second reef again and went a bit further South than we went last time. Here the top of the reef started getting a bit deeper so we could not go as far as we thought. We saw two Southern sting-rays and an eagle ray in the area between the two reefs.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-284.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued South to Vista Blue for the second dive still hoping to spot a loggerhead turtle. This time we were lucky and Roz did spot one swimming along the reef. It was quite friendly and came right up to us before swimming off again. This is only the third time we have ever seen a loggerhead and have never had one come this close to us. We also had another 20 minutes or so with the same hawksbill that we saw here last Friday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was back at Salt Pier. This has been our favourite site this year so we dive it every time we go South. It was excellent again. We saw a few green turtles as usual in the shallows and another swimming out through the pier structures. We also saw the first octopus we have come across on this visit to Bonaire. When we came to the Southernmost part of the pier, we spotted "Salt Pier Turtle". We saw this hawksbill here in 2017 and I have a picture of it as a background on my laptops, tablet and phone. We had thought it unlikely we would see it again but the photos confirmed that it was the same turtle. As with when we saw it last time, it did not seem to move much along the reef but spent 45 minutes or so eating the coral in the same spot. We left it when I was down to 60 bar and headed back to the shallows passing a few more of the small green turtles on the way. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove back to Sand Dollar for lunch and had an hour or so before the fourth dive of the day when we repeated the dive from The Cliff to Bari Reef. This was very nice as usual with plenty of fish but still no turtles. We both walked back to collect the truck. Roz stopped at Captain Don's and ordered takeaway pizzas and I picked her up on my way back. We ate the pizzas on the balcony and had another early night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th May</span>
            Today was the second leg of the play-off semi-final so we had a similar plan to last Saturday. We were up at 5:15 for the early morning Bari Reef dive. Once again, this was very nice but we could not find the turtle. Second dive was at Something Special. Usually here, we swim North and turn round when we hit the end of the reef. This time we kept going over the sandy rubbley area for a change. It was quite interesting and we did find a large green turtle that spent about ten minutes trying to wedge itself under a rock before giving up and going up for air.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-285.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove the short distance along the front to the Dive Friends, Yellow Submarine Dive Centre. We sat there for 20 minutes or so and then dived the reef in front of the dive centre. This was a nice enough dive as always but we did not see anything too spectacular. All in all, a similar morning's diving to Saturday with the addition of the turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had finished diving by 1:30, washed our gear and returned to the apartment for showers. The apartment was being cleaned when we got back so we had a bit of a wait until we could sort ourselves out but by the time the game kicked off at 2:45 we were sat on the balcony with drinks and the leftover pizza. The stream was not quite as good today as on Saturday but was good enough to watch. Not the most entertaining of games but still quite exciting and the right result.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Straight after the game had finished, we started walking into Kralendijk. We stopped for a few drinks in a bar on the seafront on the way before heading into the Bonaire Blond Brewery. This was a fine establishment with a selection of five different craft beers on tap. We ate in there and I tried all five of the beers before we started heading back. We stopped in a few of the Chinese bars that are all along the main road and got back to the apartment by about 11:00 although this is a bit of a vague memory!
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 17th May</span>
            We were up earlier than we were on Sunday but still did not do a lot all day. Most of the day was spent in the apartment. Roz went to sit in the sun for the afternoon while I watched the cricket and continued to edit our underwater photos. We had takeaway kebabs from Doner Station for tea.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We found out today that our travel insurance company have agreed to pay out for the money we lost in Indonesia when Roz lost her handbag. We have to pay the £100 excess but still get the remaining £480 back. There was no reason why they should not pay out as it was a genuine claim but it is always difficult to prove that you have lost cash so there can be problems. Good news, anyway.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 18th May</span>
            Back to diving today and we started with an early morning dive on Bari Reef. The main part of this site is to the North of the entry point but this morning for a change, we went South. The reef ends after about 30 minutes but there is a large sandy/rubbley area with enough pieces of junk around to make it interesting. The highlight was probably a tiny trunk fish.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-286.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove South for the second and third dives, diving at Invisibles and Salt Pier. Invisibles was not a great site as the second reef here is more a series of big coral bommies than a continuous reef and it is also quite deep meaning a shorter dive. The dive was still good and we had another few minutes with a feeding eagle ray. Salt Pier was as good as always with plenty of green turtles in the shallows, another on the pier and the return of the frog-fish. It had relocated itself a few metres from where we saw it last week but Roz managed to spot it as we swam through. It was good to see it back again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to Bari Reef for our evening dive - our 100th at this dive site. A nice dive as usual with a lot of fish and another octopus, but still not quite up to the standard of some of our previous dives here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After a couple of weeks of mainly self-catering and abstaining from alcohol (apart from football days!) we went back to our usual holiday routine of having a few drinks while doing log books and looking at the day's photos and then walking to Captain Don's to eat. We did not leave for Captain Don's until just before nine so it was straight to bed by the time we got back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 19th May</span>
            Another very good days diving. We headed down South again at 6:30 and were in the water at The Hilma Hooker just before 7:00. The dive sites here are not usually as busy at weekends and once again, we had the wreck to oursleves for the whole dive. Second dive was at Margate Bay. The conditions are not too bad at the moment but we are still choosing the easy entry sites and this one is quite straightforward. The dive was OK again and we did see a green turtle and another eagle ray.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-287.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Best dive of the day was at salt pier. We had our usual twenty minutes with the green turtles before swimming out to the pier. We headed to the area where we had seen the frog fish yesterday and found that it had moved back towards where we had seen it first. We had a look around to make sure it was the same one when I noticed a second frog-fish a few cm away on the same piece of sponge. They are very well camouflaged and I would have not seen this one if it had not moved. The second one was not very well positioned for photographs as it was underneath the sponge but it is unusual to see two that close together unless they have been pushed together by guides.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued to the Southern end of the pier before returning to see the frog fish again, hoping the second one would have come out. By the time we got back to them, they were both moving and a third one had appeared. It looked as if the original one was female and was being pursued by two slightly smaller males. We watched them as they moved across the reef. They are not the quickest of swimmers but we do not usually see them do anything except sitting in the same place. To see three at the same time was a first for us but to see all of them moving together was definitely a unique experience. We are not experts on frog fish mating rituals but it did look as if the two males were trying to mate with the female and after a bit of googling, this does appear to be what was going on. We had almost half an hour with them until I was down to 60 bar and had to start heading back. A bit more time with the turtles in the shallows took it up to being a 124 minute dive, our longest ever.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did our fourth dive of the day at Something Special and went back to the rubbley area at the end of the reef. This could not quite match the previous dive but we did see another green turtle, possibly the same one as a few days ago. It seems an unlikely spot for green turtles but this one seems quite happy there. Also saw a very small juvenile spotted drum.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we were back in the apartment, it was already gone 7:00. I drove to Captain Don's and got take-away pizzas which we ate on the balcony before looking at the days many photos.
