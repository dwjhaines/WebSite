            Back to diving today and another four dives. All the dives were good today although it was a slightly frustrating day. We started with our early morning dive on Bari Reef. As always this was a very nice way to start the day but once again, we were unable to find any turtles. The new resident turtle seems a lot less predictable than Turtle 1 was and we have not worked out exactly what she does in the mornings yet. Whatever it is, there was no sign of her today.

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-282.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After the first dive we had breakfast and had someone from the office round to open our safe for us so that is that panic over.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to do two dives at Karpata today. This is one of the better sites here but it is further North so a longer drive and can be a difficult entry/exit if the sea is rough. We drove up there but decided that the waves were too big and it was not worth risking. We have had problems getting in and out here before and decided then that if there was any doubt, we would err on the side of caution. Today we agreed to give it a miss. One of the other problems with Karpata is that the road round the island has become one-way by this point so it is a long drive back round to get to an alternative site. This is OK if you have just had a good dive there but is annoying when it has been a wasted journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive we went in at Andrea I and dived both the Andrea sites I & II. When we first came to Bonaire, these sites were some of the best for spotting turtles. We did see one green turtle but it was not a good quality sighting as it was quite a long way away. Dive three was at Oil Slick Leap. This was a site we had done quite a lot in the past but it had not been so good in the last few times we have visited Bonaire. Today, the vis was good and it was a better dive so it is probably back on our list of favoured dive sites. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a slight variation on our evening dive. We entered the water at The Cliff. Instead of going back to where we started, we kept going past Captain Don's and Buddy's and ended up back at Bari Reef. This was an excellent dive but is now a bit sad at the end due to the lack of turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After washing our gear and having showers, I walked back to Hamlet Oasis to collect the car. We had pasta on the balcony again for tea and it was another early night.

            Three very good dives today. We headed South again at about 6:30 after collecting tanks and our gear. First dive was at Hilma Hooker and this time we did have the wreck completely to ourselves for the whole dive. We had about an hour on the wreck before having to head for the reef just as the dive boats started arriving. We also had the bonus of an eagle ray at the top of the reef.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Salt Pier. The sea was still rough today meaning getting in and out was harder than usual. It also meant that the sand in the shallows was getting churned up quite a lot so the turtles were harder to find. We still found three on the way out and another couple on the way back and were able to spend quite a bit of time with them. The pier itself was very good again and we had another eagle ray encounter as we were leaving it to look for the turtles again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the dive we were watching other divers going in and out with various degrees of success and decided we needed an easy entry site again. We drove a short distance North to Aquarius which has a sandy entry point and did our third dive here. We have gone out to the second reef on previous dives here but this time stayed on the inner reef. The coral here was very nice and we saw our sixth turtle of the day. All three dives today were quite long again and it was already gone 2pm by the time we were heading back to Sand Dollar so we decided to call it a day and stick with the three dives. We washed our gear, had lunch on the balcony and did not do much for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We cooked tea again, ate on the balcony and were in bed by 10:00.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th May</span>
            An excellent days diving today. We were up at 6:00, collected our gear and tanks and drove South again. First dive was at Angel City. We went out to the second reef again and went a bit further South than we went last time. Here the top of the reef started getting a bit deeper so we could not go as far as we thought. We saw two Southern sting-rays and an eagle ray in the area between the two reefs.
            </p> 
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-284.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued South to Vista Blue for the second dive still hoping to spot a loggerhead turtle. This time we were lucky and Roz did spot one swimming along the reef. It was quite friendly and came right up to us before swimming off again. This is only the third time we have ever seen a loggerhead and have never had one come this close to us. We also had another 20 minutes or so with the same hawksbill that we saw here last Friday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was back at Salt Pier. This has been our favourite site this year so we dive it every time we go South. It was excellent again. We saw a few green turtles as usual in the shallows and another swimming out through the pier structures. We also saw the first octopus we have come across on this visit to Bonaire. When we came to the Southernmost part of the pier, we spotted "Salt Pier Turtle". We saw this hawksbill here in 2017 and I have a picture of it as a background on my laptops, tablet and phone. We had thought it unlikely we would see it again but the photos confirmed that it was the same turtle. As with when we saw it last time, it did not seem to move much along the reef but spent 45 minutes or so eating the coral in the same spot. We left it when I was down to 60 bar and headed back to the shallows passing a few more of the small green turtles on the way. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove back to Sand Dollar for lunch and had an hour or so before the fourth dive of the day when we repeated the dive from The Cliff to Bari Reef. This was very nice as usual with plenty of fish but still no turtles. We both walked back to collect the truck. Roz stopped at Captain Don's and ordered takeaway pizzas and I picked her up on my way back. We ate the pizzas on the balcony and had another early night.
