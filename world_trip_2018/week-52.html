            Back to diving today and another four dives. All the dives were good today although it was a slightly frustrating day. We started with our early morning dive on Bari Reef. As always this was a very nice way to start the day but once again, we were unable to find any turtles. The new resident turtle seems a lot less predictable than Turtle 1 was and we have not worked out exactly what she does in the mornings yet. Whatever it is, there was no sign of her today.

            <p class="diary-text">After the first dive we had breakfast and had someone from the office round to open our safe for us so that is that panic over.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to do two dives at Karpata today. This is one of the better sites here but it is further North so a longer drive and can be a difficult entry/exit if the sea is rough. We drove up there but decided that the waves were too big and it was not worth risking. We have had problems getting in and out here before and decided then that if there was any doubt, we would err on the side of caution. Today we agreed to give it a miss. One of the other problems with Karpata is that the road round the island has become one-way by this point so it is a long drive back round to get to an alternative site. This is OK if you have just had a good dive there but is annoying when it has been a wasted journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive we went in at Andrea I and dived both the Andrea sites I & II. When we first came to Bonaire, these sites were some of the best for spotting turtles. We did see one green turtle but it was not a good quality sighting as it was quite a long way away. Dive three was at Oil Slick Leap. This was a site we had done quite a lot in the past but it had not been so good in the last few times we have visited Bonaire. Today, the vis was good and it was a better dive so it is probably back on our list of favoured dive sites. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a slight variation on our evening dive. We entered the water at The Cliff. Instead of going back to where we started, we kept going past Captain Don's and Buddy's and ended up back at Bari Reef. This was an excellent dive but is now a bit sad at the end due to the lack of turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After washing our gear and having showers, I walked back to Hamlet Oasis to collect the car. We had pasta on the balcony again for tea and it was another early night.
