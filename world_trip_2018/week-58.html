            We checked out of the hotel at 9ish after breakfast. We had another wander round Seefeld as we were hoping to go souvenir shopping but most of the shops did not open until 10:00 so we gave up on that idea. We walked back to the hotel, collected the car and left Seefeld by about 9:30. We were heading for Garmisch-Partenkirchen but had decided to stop on the way to do a bit more cycling before we left the area. We were impressed with what we saw of the Leutasch valley yesterday and so decided to see a bit more of it.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We drove to the Eastern end of the cycle route, parked the car and cycled up the valley until the end of the route after about 9.5 miles. We then had a very easy ride back down to the car. The whole ride was very scenic with much better weather today. The sky was mainly clear so we had good views of the mountains, still covered in snow in places, for most of the ride.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got back to the car, reattached the bikes and continued driving towards Germany. It was only a couple of miles to the border at Mittenwald and then another 20 minutes or so to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We had really liked the look of Garmisch as we had driven through it on our way to Italy so decided to stop here for a night on the way back. We had not booked anywhere to stay in advance so had to drive round looking for a room. The first place was too expensive for what we were getting, the second too far out of town, but the third, The Atlas Sport Hotel was fine for one night. There was a bit of confusion about whether or not they had an available room - they initially told us they were full but when Roz told them we could book one via Booking.com they changed their minds and found one for us.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-319.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">I carried the luggage up to the room while Roz went out to buy stuff for lunch which we ate on the balcony. We went out to have a look around the town at about 5:00. I had not realised before that Garmisch-Partenkirchen used to be two towns and they were merged by Hitler for the Olympics in 1936. We are staying nearer to Partenkirchen which is the more interesting of the two parts.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was about a five minute walk from our hotel to Ludwigstraße, the most scenic part of the town. It is a long cobbled street filled with colourfully painted buildings with a background of mountains in all directions. We walked through the street and then crossed over to Garmisch which is the more modern of the two towns before walking back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out again at 7:30 and ate at one of the German restaurants on Ludwigstraße. A very good typical German meal of schnitzel with a couple of wheat beers before walking back to the hotel to watch England U21s v Croatia U21s. Again, neither of us were that interested in the game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th June</span>
            We checked out of the room before 9:00, left the car in the car park and cycled the mile and a half to the bottom of the Mount Wank cable car (the Wankbahn). The cable car takes you up from 728m to 1742m to the top of Mount Wank. The journey itself was very spectacular. We were in our own gondola and the views of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the surrounding mountains as you travel up the mountain were incredible.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-320.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">From the top there were panoramic views of the whole area and across to the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany. We ate our breakfast up there and spent about an hour wandering around looking at the views before getting the cable car back down again. We cycled back to the hotel, put the bikes back on the car and started driving towards Ulm just before midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first part of the drive was very scenic again as we looped back into Austria and then re-entered Germany near Fussen. From there it was back to the motorway and a fairly easy drive up to Ulm. We had booked two nights at the "Ibis Budget" in Ulm. We found the hotel easily enough and parked the car in the underground garage.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the room and went out on our bikes again at about 4:30. Ulm is on the Danube so once again, we were cycling on the Donauradweg. We started cycling down river for a few miles but somehow managed to miss a sign and came off the cycle route. We turned round and went back into Ulm and then went a few miles in the other direction along the Iller, another river that flows into the Danube. The whole trip was about 15 miles and we ended it by calling in at the beer garden of the Barfüßer die Hausbrauerei in Neu-Ulm. We had a few wheat beers there before returning to the hotel for an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th June</span>
            The predicted heatwave arrived today with Germany recording its highest ever June temperature. I am not sure that the temperature got as high as 40°c in Ulm but it must have been close to that and it bought back memories of the heat in Stuttgart in 2006. Despite the heat, we went out on our bikes again just after 9:00. I was keen on doing one more long bike ride before the end of our trip. We headed up river along the Donauradweg again and this time managed to stick to the route. This could have been a very easy bike ride. There was not much gradient, there was no wind and the path was surfaced all the way. However, the heat and the lack of shade for most of the way made it very hard work.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-321.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz turned round after just over eleven miles and returned to Ulm. In retrospect, this was a sensible move and I probably should have done the same. I had hoped to get to 30 miles before turning back but came to a steep hill after 28 miles and decided to give up at that point. The ride back was not much fun. 90% of the ride was in the sun with no shade. I had taken two litres of water with me but this was nowhere near enough and had just about gone before I was half way back. I made it back to Ulm after about five hours feeling pretty de-hydrated. I bumped into Roz, who by this time was out sight-seeing, as I entered the old town. We arranged to meet for lunch and I went back to the hotel for a shower and another two litres of water.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I met Roz at Nordsee in the centre of town for lunch and without having anything else we wanted to do, we decided to head back to the beer garden we were in last night. We stopped off at another branch of the Barfüßer Hausbrauerei in the centre of Ulm for one and also had a couple of drinks outside a kebab house that had a really nice seating area overlooking the river. We made it to the beer garden just after six and stayed there for almost three hours. It was a really nice place to sit and seemed a lot cooler than anywhere else in Ulm. We had a couple of drinks at Bier-Akadamie on the way back into the old town and finished the night with a final drink in the Barfüßer Hausbrauerei. Got back to the hotel round about midnight.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th June</span>
            We woke up quite late this morning and did not go out for breakfast until 11:00. We checked out of the room half an hour later and started our drive towards Bruges where we are staying tomorrow. We did not have anywhere booked for tonight but were aiming for Aachen. A couple of hours into the journey, we were making good progress so Roz booked a night at another Ibis Budget. We had a stop at a service station for lunch and were parked in Aachen by 5:45.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at 7:00. It is only about 600m from where we are staying into the centre of Aachen. When we got into the centre, we found the Aachener Brauhaus, a bar we have been to a couple of times before so called in there for a drink. We had a wander round the cathedral and town hall, the two main sights here, and then went to eat in Zum Goldenen Eincorn, another place we have been to a few times. After eating, we went back to a small bar attached to the Brauhaus and had a few beers in there while watching the lionesses winning their quarter final. Got back to the hotel at around midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 28th June</span>
            We had breakfast in the room before checking out at about 10:30. It was a drive of just over three hours to Bruge, our final destination of this trip. We had booked three nights at The Radisson Blu Hotel which is right next to the train station. This meant that we could use the car park next to the station which is cheap, easy to get to and has lots of space compared to most Belgian car parks. We got to the hotel by 2:00. Our room was not ready so we walked to the station to buy lunch. It became ready as we were eating so we were in the room by about 2:30.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-323.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out on our bikes at about 3:00. We cycled through the centre of Bruges and out to the other side where we joined the canal that heads into the Netherlands at Sluis. We have done this ride before and it is an easy, flat 12 miles along the canal. We had our first beer of the day in De Molen at Sluis before cycling back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers we walked back into the centre of Bruges. We stopped for a beer at a square that we had cycled through earlier and then walked to 't Brugs Beertje which is by far the best bar in Bruges. Unfortunately, when we got there there was a sign on the door saying "Closed until 5th July". We have had this happen to us in Belgium before but it still seems strange that places in tourist areas can close for a couple of weeks at what should be their busiest time. We walked to De Kuppe for a drink and then went to Le Trappiste which is probably our second favourite bar here. We had spent a Sunday afternoon in here a few years ago and found it was all a bit more lively on a Friday evening. We had quite a few in here including a tasting paddle each and eventually left at about midnight. We stopped for one more in the same square on the way home and were back at the hotel at about 1am.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th June</span>
            We did not do a lot all morning. The temperature is getting hotter here now as well and neither of us could be bothered to go out on our bikes again. At midday we drove out to a couple of supermarkets to stock up on Mort Subite gueuze and to buy lunch which we ate in the room. Roz then went to lie in the sun in a park for a couple of hours while I went for a walk around the centre of the city.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went out to start drinking again at 6:00. As we did yesterday, we had our first beer at Taphouse De Zandloper. We then walked through the Markt to a couple of bars that we had not been to before, Cambrinus and Cafe Rose Red. Both of these were very good bars. We had a few glasses of the excellent house beer in Cambrinus as well as a couple of their snacks. Cafe Rose Red had a very good beer list so we had a few more in there before heading to 't Poatersgat, a cellar bar that we have been to before. We left there around midnight, had a final drink back at De Zandloper and were back at the hotel by about 1am again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th June</span>
            We had planned to go to Ghent today as it is our favourite city in Belgium for drinking and has some of our favourite bars anywhere in the world. However, we decided last night that we were enjoying the bars of Bruges and it was not really worth the hassle of getting the train anywhere else. This meant that the final day of this world trip would be another day of drinking in the bars of Bruges
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-325.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 2:30 and walked straight to Brewery Bourgogne des Flandres in the centre of Bruges. We had tried their beer in Le Trappiste a couple of days ago but this was our first visit to the brewery. We did not do the tour of the brewery but went straight to the attached canal-side bar. This was a very pleasant place to spend the afternoon. We had another couple of tasting paddles, or beer flights as they are called here, as well as a couple of the brewery's own blond beer which was excellent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After about three hours in the brewery, it was a short walk across the Markt to Cambrinus. We had another tasting selection each in there which was also excellent. Things are starting to get a bit vague in the memory by now! We went back to Cafe Rose Red for one and then one more in Le Trappiste before deciding it was time to start heading back to the hotel. We stopped for one in The Vintage on the way just before it closed. The fact that this closed when it did was probably good news as we could easily have carried on drinking and we did not really need any more. The bar by the station was also closed so we were back in the hotel before 10pm. A very good session to end the trip with.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 1st July</span>
            The slightly earlier finish to last night's drinking meant that we were not feeling too bad when we got up this morning. We checked out of the hotel at 9:15 and began the 70 mile drive back to Calais. We had two stops on the way. We bought beer and tobacco in Adinkerke and wine in Calais and were at the port just after midday in time for the 13:25 ferry back to Dover.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Dover at 2pm English time and unlike the last time we were here, we were one of the first vehicles off the ferry and got through the port and out to the M20 very quickly. It was an uneventful drive back to Kingsclere where we arrived at 4:30.
