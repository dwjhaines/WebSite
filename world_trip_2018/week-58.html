            We checked out of the hotel at 9ish after breakfast. We had another wander round Seefeld as we were hoping to go souvenir shopping but most of the shops did not open until 10:00 so we gave up on that idea. We walked back to the hotel, collected the car and left Seefeld by about 9:30. We were heading for Garmisch-Partenkirchen but had decided to stop on the way to do a bit more cycling before we left the area. We were impressed with what we saw of the Leutasch valley yesterday and so decided to see a bit more of it.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We drove to the Eastern end of the cycle route, parked the car and cycled up the valley until the end of the route after about 9.5 miles. We then had a very easy ride back down to the car. The whole ride was very scenic with much better weather today. The sky was mainly clear so we had good views of the mountains, still covered in snow in places, for most of the ride.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got back to the car, reattached the bikes and continued driving towards Germany. It was only a couple of miles to the border at Mittenwald and then another 20 minutes or so to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We had really liked the look of Garmisch as we had driven through it on our way to Italy so decided to stop here for a night on the way back. We had not booked anywhere to stay in advance so had to drive round looking for a room. The first place was too expensive for what we were getting, the second too far out of town, but the third, The Atlas Sport Hotel was fine for one night. There was a bit of confusion about whether or not they had an available room - they initially told us they were full but when Roz told them we could book one via Booking.com they changed their minds and found one for us.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-319.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">I carried the luggage up to the room while Roz went out to buy stuff for lunch which we ate on the balcony. We went out to have a look around the town at about 5:00. I had not realised before that Garmisch-Partenkirchen used to be two towns and they were merged by Hitler for the Olympics in 1936. We are staying nearer to Partenkirchen which is the more interesting of the two parts.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was about a five minute walk from our hotel to Ludwigstraße, the most scenic part of the town. It is a long cobbled street filled with colourfully painted buildings with a background of mountains in all directions. We walked through the street and then crossed over to Garmisch which is the more modern of the two towns before walking back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out again at 7:30 and ate at one of the German restaurants on Ludwigstraße. A very good typical German meal of schnitzel with a couple of wheat beers before walking back to the hotel to watch England U21s v Croatia U21s. Again, neither of us were that interested in the game.
            </p>

            We checked out of the room before 9:00, left the car in the car park and cycled the mile and a half to the bottom of the Mount Wank cable car (the Wankbahn). The cable car takes you up from 728m to 1742m to the top of Mount Wank. The journey itself was very spectacular. We were in our own gondola and the views of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the surrounding mountains as you travel up the mountain were incredible.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-320.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">From the top there were panoramic views of the whole area and across to the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany. We ate our breakfast up there and spent about an hour wandering around looking at the views before getting the cable car back down again. We cycled back to the hotel, put the bikes back on the car and started driving towards Ulm just before midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first part of the drive was very scenic again as we looped back into Austria and then re-entered Germany near Fussen. From there it was back to the motorway and a fairly easy drive up to Ulm. We had booked two nights at the "Ibis Budget" in Ulm. We found the hotel easily enough and parked the car in the underground garage.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the room and went out on our bikes again at about 4:30. Ulm is on the Danube so once again, we were cycling on the Donauradweg. We started cycling down river for a few miles but somehow managed to miss a sign and came off the cycle route. We turned round and went back into Ulm and then went a few miles in the other direction along the Iller, another river that flows into the Danube. The whole trip was about 15 miles and we ended it by calling in at the beer garden of the Barfüßer die Hausbrauerei in Neu-Ulm. We had a few wheat beers there before returning to the hotel for an early night.

            The predicted heatwave arrived today with Germany recording its highest ever June temperature. I am not sure that the temperature got as high as 40°c in Ulm but it must have been close to that and it bought back memories of the heat in Stuttgart in 2006. Despite the heat, we went out on our bikes again just after 9:00. I was keen on doing one more long bike ride before the end of our trip. We headed up river along the Donauradweg again and this time managed to stick to the route. This could have been a very easy bike ride. There was not much gradient, there was no wind and the path was surfaced all the way. However, the heat and the lack of shade for most of the way made it very hard work.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">Roz turned round after just over ten miles and returned to Ulm. In retrospect, this was a sensible move and I probably should have done the same. I had hoped to get to 30 miles before turning back but came to a steep hill after 28 miles and decided to give up at that point. The ride back was not much fun. 90% of the ride was in the sun with no shade. I had taken two litres of water with me but this was nowhere near enough and had just about gone before I was half way back. I made it back to Ulm after about five hours feeling pretty de-hydrated. I bumped into Roz, who by this time was out sight-seeing, as I entered the old town. We arranged to meet for lunch and I went back to the hotel for a shower and another two litres of water.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I met Roz at Nordsee in the centre of town for lunch and without having anything else we wanted to do, we decided to head back to the beer garden we were in last night. We stopped off at another branch of the Barfüßer Hausbrauerei in the centre of Ulm for one and also had a couple of drinks outside a kebab house that had a really nice seating area overlooking the river. We made it to the beer garden just after six and stayed there for almost three hours. It was a really nice place to sit and seemed a lot cooler than anywhere else in Ulm. We had a couple of drinks at Bier-Akadamie on the way back into the old town and finished the night with a final drink in the Barfüßer Hausbrauerei. Got back to the hotel round about midnight.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th June</span>
            We woke up quite late this morning and did not go out for breakfast until 11:00. We checked out of the room half an hour later and started our drive towards Bruges where we are staying tomorrow. We did not have anywhere booked for tonight but were aiming for Aachen. A couple of hours into the journey, we were making good progress so Roz booked a night at another Ibis Budget. We had a stop at a service station for lunch and were parked in Aachen by 5:45.
