            Another day of not doing much. I had considered going to Verona which is only 19 miles away but could not be bothered. Roz spent most of the day by the pool. I had an hour lying in the sun which is long enough for me but spent most of the rest of the day in the apartment. We decided to have a night off the wine so had tea on our terrace.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 18th June - England U21 v France U21</span>
            We were up at 7:30, had breakfast, loaded up the car and left the apartment by about 8:45. We dropped the keys back at the office and were on our way out of Sirmione before 9:00. We had a drive of about 90 minutes to get to Bologna airport where Mark was due to land at 10:20. His flight landed on time so by about 11:00, we were all on our way to Cesena, the venue for England's first game of the tournament. It was about another hour's drive to Cesena and we found the Bed&Bike Hotel without too many problems.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There was a bit of confusion with the bookings when we tried to check in. Mark had not been able to book a single room for one night and had canceled his three night booking. We had booked a triple room but for two people. When we were shown the room, it was a double not a triple. The manager of the hotel showed up after about ten minutes and got a single bed put into the double room. Not too much space but it is fine for one night.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-313.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Once this was sorted out and we had left our stuff in the room, the three of us headed out towards the centre of Cesena. It was a 10 - 15 minute walk to the centre of town. First impressions were not great as there did not seem to be anything open and the whole place seemed a bit dead. We found a small bar where we had a couple of drinks and realised in there that we had not yet found the main square. This was only a couple of minutes walk away so we headed there from the bar. The main square was a lot better. There were at least a few other England fans around and the square itself was quite nice. We had a beer in the square while waiting for the craft beer bars to open. (There appear to be craft beer pubs everywhere we go in Italy but none open before 17:00)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was a small "football museum" that we had walked past earlier that did not open until 4:30. We popped back there on the way to the next pub. It was not the biggest of museums, more like a collection of football memorabilia that had been cleared out of someones loft, but what was there was reasonably interesting and it was free to look around so quite good really.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got to the Mosaic beer pub just after 5. This was an excellent bar again. Very good range of beers and good food. We had a couple in there with our burgers before starting to walk towards the ground. There was a second craft beer pub, Brasserie Arnage, also very good, just before we got to the ground. We had one more in there and headed over to the ground about 40 minutes before the 9pm kick-off. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The other games in the tournament had not been particularly well attended apart from the Italy match, but there were quite a lot of people around and it took longer than expected to get in. Most of the 11,228 crowd were Italian with only a handful of England fans and no French fans that we could see. We were in our seats just before kick-off and surprisingly managed to sell our spare ticket on the way in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was pretty good but once again England managed to lose from a winning position due to a couple of stupid mistakes. Losing that late again was particularly hard to take. The result (1 - 2) does not mean that we are out of the tournament yet but it does mean that getting through to the semi-finals is not going to be easy. We need to win our next two games and still rely on other results going our way. Not a great position to be in after the first game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to Brasserie Arnage after the final whistle. They had a problem with their cooling system and were only serving bottles so we went back to Mosaic again. None of us really felt like drinking after the way we had lost the game so we just had one and before heading back to the hotel. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 19th June</span>
            We had to check out of the hotel by 10:00. We ate breakfast at a nearby cafe and got back in the car for the drive to Modena. We had to put petrol in and then missed a diversion sign adding a few miles to the route but apart from that it was an uneventful journey. We found the apartment by about 12:45. I waited with the car round the corner while Roz and Mark went to the apartment and had a wait of about 45 minutes before the owner appeared and gave them our parking permit. We were then able to move the car to right outside the apartment and bring the bikes into a courtyard so everything is reasonably secure for a couple of days.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-314.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the apartment and went out at about 4:30. Modena was quite a nice town to wander around with a few nice buildings and squares. We walked round the Military Acadamy and into Piazza Grande, the biggest of the squares with the Cathedral on one side. We stopped for a beer just outside Piazza Grande, again while waiting for the craft beer pubs to open. Modena is another place with a lot of craft beer pubs. We went to "Slanzi Pub and Vinyl" which was a good pub but it did not have a TV. Just about every game in the tournament has an impact on England's chances of qualification now so we were keen on watching both of this evening's games. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from Slazni to "The Bricks" which appeared to be permanently closed but found a street nearby with several bars on it. We walked down here and found a couple of places with TVs. The first did not want to put the football on but the second one, "Over 18", was another craft beer pub and did put it on for us. It also had a good range of beer and good food so we watched the end of Spain v Belgium and stayed in there for the Italy v Austria. Spain winning was not ideal but anything except a draw in the second game was good news so good results overall. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the apartment via one more bar and got back at about 12:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 20th June</span>
            Did not do much all morning. Mark went out and bought breakfast which we ate while looking at next seasons football fixtures which came out this morning. We went out for a walk at about 12:30. There was not much sight-seeing that we had left to do. We had a walk around Modena's football stadium which is not far from where we are staying but were not able to get inside it. We walked back into the centre of town to visit Galateria Bloom which apparently has the best ice-creams in this region of Italy. After eating what were indeed very good ice-creams, we wandered back to the apartment via the main squares.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-315.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers and afternoon naps, we went out again at 5ish. There was another pub/brewery that we wanted to visit, the excellently named "Beer Belly", which was a couple of km North of where we are staying in the opposite direction to the town centre. We stopped for a drink at a bar near the station on the way as Beer Belly did not open until 6pm. It was a bit of a walk to get there and things were not looking promising as we approached what appeared to be a large industrial area with no sign of bars or shops. However, once we did find it, it was an excellent place. The bar had a large seating area with views of the brewery itself. The beer again was very good and when bought in 1.3 litre jugs was cheaper than drinking in the centre of town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to have one or two drinks in there before walking back into town to watch this evenings games but ended up staying where we were. We followed the games on our phones and the score in the Denmark v Austria game meant that England can still get to the semi-finals if they win their last two games by enough goals. It also meant that the next game was largely irrelevant so we ordered pizzas and more beer and stayed where we were until gone 11. We had planned to stop at the station bar again on the way home but it was closed when we got back to it so we returned to the apartment and had a bottle of wine before going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st June - England U21 v Romania U21</span>
            We put the bikes back on the car, had breakfast in the apartment and left Modena just after 9:00. We dropped Mark off at Bologna airport just after 10:00 as he had an 11:20 flight back home. From the airport, there was quite heavy traffic for half an hour or so but we still made it back to Cesana just after midday.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-316.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had booked a room at The Bed and Bike Hotel again and were able to check into it about ten minutes after we arrived. We had showers and went straight out. We walked back into the main square and went for a drink in the same bar we were in on Tuesday. We had a few more drinks through the afternoon but spent a lot of time trying to find somewhere to eat. We knew that a lot of restaurants in Italy close during the afternoon but here just about all of them were shut. We walked out to a couple that were open but they were just serving drinks, not food. We ended up back in the bar we started in where they did serve snacks before starting to walk to the ground. We had one more on the way and got to the ground just after 6:00 for a 6:30 kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There had been a lot more fans around this afternoon than there had been on Tuesday. There were more England fans around but most of the crowd today were Romanians mainly due to the number of them that live in Italy. There were queues to get in again but we were still in our seats just before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was another good game but another one that England managed to throw away. Starting a game that we had to win without our best players on the pitch was always likely to end in failure and so it turned out. We were  one of the favourites to win the competition but have managed to get knocked out after two games without a point. Once again, a very disappointing way to exit a competition.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got out of the ground as soon as the final whistle went and went straight to a pizza restaurant a few minutes walk away. We finally had our meal in there and consoled ourselves with a couple of jugs of wine while France beat Croatia to confirm that England were out of the competition. We went for a few more beers in Brasserie Arnage which was just about next door to the restaurant. As with Portugal, the quality of the beer in Italy has been unbelievably good and completely different to what we have had to drink on previous visits. The gueuze in this place has been particularly good. We walked back to the hotel sometime after midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 22nd June</span>
            We had decided before the game yesterday that if England got knocked out, we would not bother with the third group game in San Marino on Monday but would start driving towards home immediately instead. We had not really expected this to happen but after last night's results there did not seem a lot of point in hanging around for three days to watch a totally meaningless game. We want to get back to England on July 1st so beginning the journey today will give us a bit more time.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-317.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We checked out of the hotel just before 10:00, had breakfast in the cafe next door again and were on our way by about 10:15. We did not really know how far we would drive today but Roz noticed that the vignette we had from the way down for Austrian motorways was still valid for today but would expire at the end of the day. Getting most of the way across Austria today would mean that we would not have to buy another one. We selected Seefeld as a suitable stopping point which should have taken about five hours. Instead, the 320 mile journey took eight and a half hours with only a couple of very brief stops. The traffic was heavy all the way and the whole journey involved a lot of time being stationary on the motorway. We don't know if this is because it is a Saturday or if it is always this bad but either way, the journey took a lot longer than it should have done.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The weather today was bad for the first time since we arrived in Italy. It was raining when we left Cesana and was wet and cloudy for most of the journey. At least this did keep the temperature down which made sitting in stationary traffic a bit more bearable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we finally did get to Seefeld, the hotel we had wanted to stay in was full. We tried another over the road and they only had a dinner, bed and breakfast option for €120. This was more than we wanted to pay but we had not eaten since breakfast so the included evening meal made it not too bad a deal. After a lot of messing about getting the car parked, we had showers and were in the restaurant by 7:30. The meal was pretty good with four courses plus a buffet salad. It was a bit like some of the tasting menus we have had i.e. small portions of very good food. All very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we went out for a walk around Seefeld town centre which is only a few minutes walk away. I have been here before about 34 years ago but there is not too much that I could recognise. It is all nice enough but a bit new and almost too perfect looking. We were back in the hotel by 10 for an earlier and more sober night than most of the ones in the last week or so.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 23rd June</span>
            We had breakfast in the hotel and then spent a bit of time trying to sort out what we are doing next week, the last week of our trip. We had always planned to spend a bit more time in Germany and the last few days in Belgium. We have booked a hotel in Bruges for the last three nights without any problems but German is not proving so easy. There is due to be a heatwave in central Germany in the middle of the week with the temperatures reaching over 40°c in some of the places we were thinking of staying in. Most German hotels do not have air-conditioning. Sleeping in non air-conditioned rooms in that sort of heat is just about impossible so our options have become quite limited.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We decided that we are in no hurry to move North so went down and booked another night where we are. We will stay in this area until Tuesday before continuing the journey home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was getting on for 11:00 by this time. We walked into the centre again and went to tourist information where we got a map of the cycle routes in the area. We went out on our bikes just before midday. We chose an "easy" route, a 15km round trip to and from Leutasch. We soon found out that an easy route in The Alps is still quite challenging particularly the off-road bits that are more designed for mountain bikes. We did get there however and cycled a short way along the Leutasch valley before heading back up the hill to Seefeld. For the return journey we stuck to the road instead of the cycle route (which was very badly signposted by German/Austrian standards) and this did make things a bit easier.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-318.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in the hotel by just after 2:00 and had lunch sat on the balcony. We decided that weather permitting, we will stay in Garmisch-Partenkirchen which is not far away tomorrow and booked another hotel in Ulm for two nights from Tuesday. We also booked our ferry ticket back to Dover for a week tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We watched England v Cameroon in the womens world cup before going down to the restaurant to eat. It was a similar meal to last nights but I thought the food was better and it was bigger portions. We had another walk round Seefeld after eating. The weather which had been grey and cloudy since we got here was finally getting a bit brighter and we could see all the surrounding mountains for the first time. We returned to the room and put on Austria v Germany in the Under 21s although neither of us were that interested in it.
            </p>
