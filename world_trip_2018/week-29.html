            We were woken at 6:30 as usual, packed our bags and went up for breakfast. We paid our bar bill and then all went up to the sun deck for team photos. We left the boat at 8ish and were taken by dinghy back to Lizard Island. We had an hour or so to kill waiting around before walking to the airport. This time we had moored near the airport so did not have as far to walk as last week. We had a bit more time to kill before the planes came in and started taking us back to Cairns. We managed to get into the first plane which was a four seater so there was just us, Kierron, the tour leader and the pilot. Once again, it was a very enjoyable one hour flight, flying all the way at about 200m above the outer barrier reef.

            <p class="diary-text">At the airport in Cairns, we discovered that our hotel reservation had been canceled by Agodo. We had expected this to happen due to problems with Roz's credit card but were hoping that they had been able to sort it out. We managed to book another hotel nearby and got the bus to drop us there instead. We were there by about 12:30 and sat around in reception until our room was ready just before 2pm. We had internet access for the first time in over a week so spent the time catching up on e-mails, etc.
