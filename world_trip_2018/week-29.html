            We were woken at 6:30 as usual, packed our bags and went up for breakfast. We paid our bar bill and then all went up to the sun deck for team photos. We left the boat at 8ish and were taken by dinghy back to Lizard Island. We had an hour or so to kill waiting around before walking to the airport. This time we had moored near the airport so did not have as far to walk as last week. We had a bit more time to kill before the planes came in and started taking us back to Cairns. We managed to get into the first plane which was a four seater so there was just us, Kerrin (the tour leader) and the pilot. Once again, it was a very enjoyable one hour flight, flying all the way at about 200m above the outer barrier reef.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-156.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">At the airport in Cairns, we discovered that our hotel reservation had been canceled by Agodo. We had expected this to happen due to problems with Roz's credit card but were hoping that they had been able to sort it out. We managed to book another hotel nearby (Coral Tree Inn) and got the bus to drop us there instead. We were there by about 12:30 and sat around in reception until our room was ready just before 2pm. We had internet access for the first time in over a week so spent the time catching up on e-mails, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out after putting our bags in the room. We had pies for lunch and bought a few things from the supermarket/bottle shop. Cairns is still incredibly hot and humid so we did not do a lot else before returning to the air-conditioning. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going back to the same Thai restaurant we had eaten in just over a week ago. Excellent food once again with a couple of bottles of wine. After eating, we had one more beer at "Rattle and Hum" on The Esplanade before returning to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th December</span>
            We stayed in the room until checkout at 11:00. We wrote a few postcards which are doubling up as Christmas cards and walked out to the post office before going to McDonalds for breakfast. We wandered round a few of the souvenir shops mainly to try and find Christmas presents for each other with varying degrees of success before heading back to the hotel again. We had tried to get  a later check out from the hotel but instead spent a lot of the next few hours sat around in reception. We did go back into Cairns for another look round the shops but again, it was too hot to do a lot other than sit in the air-conditioning.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-157.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We used Uber again to get us to the airport just after 4pm. At the airport I discovered that my dive bag, i.e. the one which has our dive gear and most of the rest of my stuff in, had ripped and had two large holes in it at one end. I knew it was getting past its best but was hoping it would survive this trip. I have no idea when it happened but most likely broke between leaving the boat and getting to Cairns. I temporarily fixed it with cable ties and string but it is going to need a much better repair or, more probably needs completely replacing. We checked in and had an uneventful wait for the 18:50 Jetstar flight to Bali which left just about on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Bali at 9:30 local time. Immigration was very quick and thankfully my luggage made it without falling apart again. We took money out and were met in arrivals by a driver from Ganesh Amed where we will be staying for the next eight days. We left the airport by 10:30 and had a journey of just over two hours to Jemeluk. We were taken to the same room that we had stayed in six years ago and got to bed shortly before 1am.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th December</span>
            We were up by about 8:00 and had breakfast in the restaurant. Jemeluk is a quiet little village that does have very good local diving but we had decided that we needed a few days of relaxation and not doing much. We have been here a few times before and are staying in a small place with only six rooms dotted around a small pool, right on the beach front. The balcony we have is one of the nicest we have had anywhere. It has plenty of space, has chairs and sun-loungers, views of the sea to the front and Mt Agung to the side.....and all for about £26 a night.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We decided to go straight out after breakfast as we needed to buy water but found that Roz no longer had one of her handbags. This contained most of our cash, including the £300 worth of Indonesian money we had taken out at the airport, and several of her credit/debit cards. She knows she had it in the car from the airport so had either left it in the car or somehow dropped it as we were getting out. We were able to get in touch with the driver of the car but he says it is not in there so it does look as if it was lost.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We spent an hour or so canceling the cards and contacting the insurance company. A lot of the cash is covered and there is no problem with the cards but it is a lot of hassle that we could have done without and obviously, Roz is upset about losing her handbag and purse. We eventually did go out only to find that none of the ATM's in Jemeluk were working. We did still have some English cash so changed that and were able to start buying things but we could do with the ATM's coming back to life soon. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch at the hotel and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from another round of phone calls re the missing bag when the UK had started to wake up. I eventually managed to get money out of an ATM by about 5pm despite Santander's concerns about my previous attempts. Not quite as relaxing a day as planned!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at Diver's Cafe in the evening. Good curry but poor chicken sate. Back in our room by about 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th December</span>
            The only thing we had still to do regarding the loss of handbag was to obtain a police report for our insurance company. This was not as straight-forward as it should have been but was quite an entertaining experience in the end. Firstly, the nearest police station is at Polsek Abang about 30 minutes drive away. Wayan, our driver from the airport was ready to drive us out there after breakfast. Also coming with us was Hans. Hans is from the Netherlands and is somehow linked to where we are staying. He does not own the place but deals with all the e-mails, etc and happens to be staying there at the moment. He is fluent in Indonesian and was coming along to act as a translator. We did not think this was really necessary. We were wrong!
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-159.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">At the police station, the police worked out very quickly what we wanted - it was not that complicated. However, they were reluctant to give us the report without being shown photo copies of the lost cards or at least all the details of the cards. We did not have these details and it should not have been important as the main thing for us was the lost cash. The cards did not matter as they have already been canceled. The police were insisting on the card details and kept pointing to their rules which said such details were required. It was at this point that we would totally have failed if we had not had Hans with us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Proceedings were interrupted a couple of times. Firstly there was a minor earthquake which meant everyone, including the station's solitary prisoner had to go and stand in the car park for about five minutes. Secondly, the goals from last nights premier league games were being shown on the television which seemed more interesting to everyone than our report.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the earthquake, Hans started dealing with a different, more senior (we think) officer. He was from the same village as the owner of our accommodation and recognised Hans. This certainly helped our cause. He actually seemed to want to help and after a brief trip out to photocopy Roz's passport, they produced the report. We do not really know how useful it will be but the insurance company said we have to have one and now we do.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After all this excitement, we were driven back to Jemeluk. I got out of the car a mile or so before Ganesh Amed and got my hair cut and also went to ask one of the dive centers about diving tomorrow. Every other business in Jemeluk seems to be a dive centre and a lot of them do not look to be overly professional operations but we only want to hire tanks and weights to go diving from the beach so this is not a big problem. We had lunch in the restaurant again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 3:30ish, we walked down to Eco Dive, one of the better dive operators here and the company we have used when we dived here previously. Their prices are still very good and we will probably dive with them for a few days starting on Saturday. Walked back along the beach and were able to get money out of the ATM again. We ate at Bamboo Bali which has the same owner as Ganesh Amed. Had a much better meal than last night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th December</span>
            Back to diving today. We will start diving with Eco Dive tomorrow but wanted to dive at a site that is only a mile or so down the road from us first. The site is the house reef of Cafe Garam a resort we nearly stayed at when we first came here twelve years ago. They have their own dive centre there so we could carry our gear down there, hire tanks and weights and dive from the beach. The cost of this was Rp55,000 each per dive which is about £3 making it the cheapest diving we have ever done.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When we dived here previously, there was a big area of "artificial reef" which mainly consisted of large items of junk placed in the water for coral to grow on. It was an excellent macro dive with all sorts of things living in the junk and a map in the dive centre telling you what lived where. A lot of the objects have been washed away and it was a bit more of a challenge finding things but the dives were no less enjoyable for that. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-160.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After a minor panic with Roz's camera, we were in the water just after 9:00. We swam down to a cleaning station (pile of tyres) at about 23m which had loads of life including several juvenile angel fish and a tiny yellow box fish. Plenty more to see in the shallows including a couple of ghost pipe fish as we were swimming back in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent the surface interval in the restaurant and were told about a frog fish that was just above the cleaning station. We tried to find it on the second dive but were unsuccessful. Roz did find a Picachu nudibranch and just before the end of the dive, I did manage to find a small frog fish. All in all, an excellent couple of dives and incredibly good value for the money we paid. Dives lasted 95 and 77 minutes. I took the TG5 on the two dives here. Still not really got to grips with how it all works and the best settings but did get some good pictures.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We rinsed our gear, carried it all back to Ganesh Amed and had lunch in the restaurant. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon. Roz lay in the sun by the pool, I stayed in the room or on the balcony sorting out the photos from this morning. We ate at Bamboo Bali again in the evening and had another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th December</span>
            Another day of diving today. After breakfast, we carried our gear to Eco Dive about 10 minutes walk away. Although there is beach diving from Jemeluk, there are some sites that you need to get to by boat. Although we were not using guides, Eco Dive rent us the tanks and weights and also sort out the boat and porters. (There is a co-operative of dive porters in this area and everyone pays to get their tanks carried to and from the beach or boats. It is still very cheap and some of the money apparently goes into local village projects.)
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-161.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Bunutan, about 10 minutes away by boat. This dive did not start particularly well. The vis was not great and we did not see as much in the deeper parts of the site as we did when we have dived here previously. However, after about half an hour I spotted a hawksbill turtle. We stayed with the turtle for the rest of the dive. It was incredible the difference between this one and the turtles that we had seen in Australia that were petrified of divers. This one just carried on eating and was not the slightest bit put out by us staying with her and taking photos. She conveniently moved higher up the reef when we needed to enabling us to stay with her until I was getting low on air and we had to move off to do our safety stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had our surface interval back at the dive centre before diving at Pyramids. This is site with a lot of artificial reef structures. We spent some time looking at these before having to move up due to lack of bottom time. This time, it was Roz who spotted a hawksbill and we had another half an hour watching this one eating in the shallows. Again, the turtle was totally unaffected by us being there. After the disappointment of the Turtle Spectacular, this was an excellent morning's diving.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive after lunch was a site we had not dived before. We dived from the beach opposite Eco Dive, a site that I think is called Amed Wall. We did this without a boat meaning we had to return to the starting point. There was quite strong current in paces meaning that we did not get as far along the wall as we wanted to but this did not really matter. There was still plenty to see including a couple of stone fish and a few nudis and again, it was an enjoyable enough dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got drunk in the evening while following the football. We had a few glasses of our Australian wine on the balcony before going out to eat at Bamboo Bali again. We had pina coladas with our meal and then started on the duty free Bacardi when we got back. Managed to stay awake until full time just before 1am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th December</span>
            Did not do a lot all day today. We were both tired after diving yesterday evening and could have done with an early night. Staying up until 1 and drinking the amount we did, did not make us feel any less tired today. Spent the whole day either in the room or on the balcony with the exception of a couple of trips to the restaurant for meals.
