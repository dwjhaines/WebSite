            Today we repeated the dives we did on Saturday i.e. two on the wreck with the second dive at Drop Off. We were in the water for the first dive on the wreck at about 5:40 again. There were a few bump-heads around when we got to the wreck but they did not seem to be there in the same numbers as last week. Still a good dive and we were able to spend about 15 minutes with one of the hawksbills that we have now seen here on three occasions.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive at Drop Off, we went further round the corner than we had gone last time. Because of the way the reef slopes, it is always a lot quicker getting back than the outward swim. We had forgotten this last week so had not gone as far as we could have. Today we did not turn round until about 45 minutes so saw more of the reef. Saw lots of nudibranches again, some big schools of fish and a couple of Napoleon wrasse. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was back on the wreck. We went in at about 3:30 and almost as soon as we got to the wreck we saw a hawksbill. This was the first one that we had seen on Saturday and we were able to spend about 30 minutes with it watching it eat. While Roz was still watching this one, this mornings turtle reappeared. When the first one left, we stayed with the second giving us about an hour in total with the two of them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz was totally worn out after the third dive and went straight to sleep. She managed to get up to go out and eat at The Safety Stop but it was another early night.

            Another early start in as we started another dive at the wreck just after 5:40. This was another excellent dive. We saw bumpheads round the stern area of the wreck in the place where we always used to see them. They were just hanging around, totally un-bothered by us and stayed there until the first lot of Asian divers came charging in with their cameras and lights. This dispersed the bump-heads fairly quickly and they all started moving towards the other end of the boat.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-168.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed at the top of the wreck when everyone moved on and were soon joined by one of the two resident turtles. We stayed with this one for the best part of an hour. We were halfway down the wreck when it went up for air. When it came down, it came back near the second resident turtle. This one led us back to the stern so we were with it until the end of the dive. This turtle also bought Roz's turtle count to 500 since we left home! Plenty more bump-heads around and our longest dive here so far - 111 minutes.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive, we did Coral Garden again but entered from the Drop Off entry which is easier. It is only about 15 minutes from the entry to the main part of the Coral Garden site which was very good again. Plenty of fish everywhere as usual.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back to the wreck again for the third dive. Only saw one of the turtles this time but again could watch her for quite a long time. We did make it quickly round the front of the wreck when the turtle went deeper and we finally left her. No sign of the leaf scorpion fish from yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Quite a bit of rain today for the first time since we arrived in Indonesia.It did not affect our diving and was mainly in the afternoon between the second and third dives. It is supposed to be the wet season so we have been quite lucky so far. We ate at Warung Kamang again tonight, the restaurant  we have eaten in a couple of times already. Managed to get Rp5,000,000 out of the ATM (about half of what we will owe Tulamben Wreck Divers) which caused Santander to go into a panic again.

            Had a bit of a lie in this morning and did not start the first dive until 6:40. This meant that we missed most of the bump-heads but we had a bit more light to see the wreck and there were no-where near as many other divers around. We had a more normal dive profile today. We went down to about 20m, found the leaf scorpion fish again, and continued for a complete circuit of the wreck. The was a big school of rainbow runners in the hold in the middle of the wreck together with a lot of sergeant majors that appeared to be laying eggs. As we got back to the stern we found Wreck Turtle 2 in the shallows so could spend 10 minutes with her and complete our safety stop before ending the dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to Drop Off for the second dive. We had another turtle encounter here for 10 minutes or so before continuing round the wall. Dive three was at the wreck again. This was not a great dive. Our plan on this dive was simply to look for the turtles and stay with whichever one we found. I commented as we walked down to the entry point that it looked as if there may be some current but we were not expecting it to be anywhere near as bad as it was. We had to swim into mild current to get to the wreck but as soon as we got there it changed direction. It was still not too bad and we went with the current to the front. By the time we had turned to get back, it was worse than we had ever known it here and it was a struggle to make it back to the stern. By the time we did get back and were sheltered from the current, Roz had had enough and we aborted the dive after 66 minutes. No sign of any of the turtles!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at The Safety Stop again and managed again to take out another Rp5,000,000 from the ATM. This time without any phone calls or text messages from Santander. We now have enough cash to pay our bill when we leave on Saturday.
            </p>

            Back to a 5:10 start this morning and in the water at the wreck by about 5:45. A much more relaxing experience than yesterday afternoon with no current at all. There were not huge numbers of bump-heads around but we had very good views of the ones that were there. We did go down to about 20m but spent most of the dive in the shallows looking at the bump-heads and looking for the turtles. No turtles this morning but a very enjoyable 113 minute dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at Coral Garden was not as good. There did not seem to be much around and the novelty of the underwater statues is starting to wear off! It has been a very good site but we have probably dived here enough times now. Also, I had one of the heavier tanks for this dive. We had totally forgotten about them but some of the tanks here are a lot heavier than others for no obvious reason and we had commented about it last time we were here. This messes up buoyancy, they are uncomfortable to dive with and they also seem to contain less air. Unfortunately, the difference is not obvious until you are underwater!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went for lunch somewhere we had not eaten before (mainly because Roz liked the turtle logo of the attached dive centre) and saw the first evidence of Christmas since leaving Australia. It has been a strange build up to Christmas. Everywhere was very Christmasy when we were in Australia in November and early December but in the last two weeks we have not seen a single Christmas decoration.... until the restaurant today which had a small tree and a particularly festive piece of tinsel on the bar. This will all change in a couple of days time.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">As always, the third dive of the day was back on the wreck. This was an excellent dive again. There was quite a bit of current again but we did not go all the way to the end of the wreck so were able to stay sheltered from the worst of it. We also managed to find the turtles this time. Wreck Turtle 1 joined us before we had got to the wreck. We stayed with her as she made her way to the middle of the wreck where she was briefly joined by Wreck Turtle 2. After they had argued over territory, #1 left and we stayed with #2. She eventually headed towards the bow section and we decided not to go that far due to the current. We knew roughly where #1 had gone, managed to find her again within a couple of minutes and stayed with her until it was time to leave the wreck. About 65 minutes with them in total.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were going to eat at Warung Kamang tonight but it was closed so walked down to The Safety Stop again instead. Back in the room before 9pm.

            Our final day of diving at Tulamben. First dive of the day, another early wreck dive, was excellent. Not huge numbers of bump-heads around but could get very close to the ones that were there. The vis was good and there was no current. We went down to see the leaf scorpion fish again and after a bit of time around the middle of the boat before heading down to the front. Not long after we had started swimming back, Roz spotted Wreck Turtle 2. We had about 10 -15 minutes with her before I was getting low on air and we had to leave. As we left, the turtle stopped eating, went up for air and then swam along with us for a few minutes before stopping to eat again. Another dive of over 100 minutes and an excellent way to start the day again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive after breakfast was at Drop Off for the last time. This was another good dive with a lot of nudibranchs. This site has always been good for them but we seemed to find a large variety of them today in all sorts of sizes and colours.
