            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 25th March</span>
            We were up at 5:00 for the 5:30 departure for Tarakan. We left Derawan with Phillip and Antonela as well as Waldo. It was an uneventful boat journey and onward transfer to the airport. We got to the airport by 8:30 and went straight to the lounge that we used last year for breakfast. We stayed in the lounge until it was boarding time for the 11:30 MAS Wings flight back to Tawau.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">At Tawau, we collected our luggage and said goodbye to Phillip and Antonela who were heading back to KL. We got the Scuba Junkie transfer with Waldo to Semporna. We were taken directly to the Scuba Junkie office in Semporna to fill out our paperwork. Waldo is going to Mabul with them tomorrow and we will go there on Friday. We were taken from there to The Seafest Hotel.... only to be told that our room was at the Seafest Boutique about 50m down the road. We checked in, put our stuff in the room and went straight out for lunch at an Indian restaurant near the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we walked into Semporna where we had a few things to sort out. We went back to the Scuba Junkie office where someone was able to fix the problem with Roz's inflater hose. He was able to get the parts out of the old one that we had got from Jordon and put them into Roz's broken one meaning it should now work. Roz had borrowed a BCD for the last few days of diving from Derawan but she should be able to use her own for the rest of the trip. The BCD still really needs replacing but we can worry about that when we get home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">From there, we walked to another dive shop where I was able to get a replacement o-ring for my TG-5 housing. The TG-5 will be better than the S95 for the macro sites at Mabul so this was good news as well. Roz managed to get anti-histamine cream for a rash that she has had for the last few days and also bought a new SIM card. We bought a few things from Giant Supermarket for the next ten days (mainly vodka) and also a battery for one of our dive computers. After what was a very successful shopping trip, we returned to the room by about 4:30. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to our usual restaurant in the evening. We met Waldo there but all left straight after eating. I tried unsuccessfully to get my previous Malaysian SIM working before giving up and going back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th March</span>
            A slightly later start this morning. We were up at about 8:00 and went for a roti canai breakfast before returning to the room to pack. We were picked up at 10:00 by Kapalai Dive Resort and driven to their pier which is only about 100m from the hotel. The jetty area was packed with about 50 other people all heading out to Kapalai. We knew that their customer base was largely Chinese but were still surprised that there were only two other non-Chinese people there. We were on the second boat to leave and departed for Kapalai just before 10:30.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Kapalai is a resort built entirely on stilts on a submerged sand bar. It it considered a bit more upmarket than staying at Mabul but with their special offers, it is not that much more expensive. We are here for three days before transferring back to Scuba Junkie on Mabul.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At Kapalai we were shown to the restaurant where we met Rodel, one of the dive instructors here. After we had filled in our forms, he asked us when we wanted to do our orientation dive. We said as soon as possible and he said we could dive at midday. Our room was not yet ready so we left our stuff in the luggage room and headed for the dive centre. After a quick briefing, we walked straight down to the house reef. We have dived here before from Mabul. It is a good macro site made up mainly of artificial structures. We saw plenty of nudibranchs, a ghost pipe fish, a turtle, a pegasus sea-moth and a frog fish. Not too bad a start. The dive was only 40 minutes long. All the dives are short here for some reason and this one was shorter than usual as it was the orientation dive. However, once this is out the way, we can dive the house reef on our own for as long as we want which was one of the main attractions of coming here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, we had lunch and were given the key to our room. The room is really nice. There is plenty of space, a lovely balcony looking out towards Mabul and windows on all sides so nice and cool. The whole thing has been really nicely done. It is a shame we are only here for three days.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-252.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have too much time in the room before going back to the dive centre for the second dive. This was a boat dive although still in front of the resort. The site was Peacock Reef. We have almost certainly dived here before as well although the sites all have different names to the ones we are used to. We were diving with Linda, another local guide. The start of the dive was not great as there was not a lot to see. However, after about 30 minutes, Roz found a blue-ring octopus. This was bigger than the one we had seen in Lembeh and seemed quite happy to stay out on a rock without moving off. We stayed with it for about ten minutes before having to move off to do our safety stop. The short dive times are already proving very frustrating! On this dive it would have been very easy to stay with the octopus and then swim back to the resort but that is not the way they do things here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an hour surface interval and then went off on our own onto the house reef again. We had considered swimming down to the area where we had seen the blue-ring but quite a strong current put an end to that idea. We went out to look for the frog fish again. We did find it but it moved to the inside of the structure it was on so was quite hard to see. However, there were a few turtles trying to sleep on top of the structure. We think we saw five in total on the dive but they were moving around. We failed to find the ghost pipe fish again but it was still an enjoyable 75 minute dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the dive centre, we discovered that we are on the boat to Sipadan tomorrow. We put our gear away and returned to the room for an hour or so. Meals here are all buffet style in a large restaurant.Dinner is served from 7:00 - 8:30. We turned up at 7:45 to find most of the food had gone. We had been warned about this in some reviews we had read but were not expecting it to be as bad as it was. Staff were very apologetic and bought us out more food so not a bad meal in the end. Back in the room by about 8:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 27th March</span>
            Another early start as we had to be on the jetty by 5:15 for the trip to Sipadan. The boat left just after 5:30. There were six other divers on the boat, the two Russian women who came across at the same time as us yesterday, an American woman (who was born in Hong Kong and we had assumed was Chinese) and three Chinese girls. The Russians had paid extra to have their own guide (Rodel) leaving the rest of us to dive with Joshua.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The registration office was closed when we arrived at Sipadan so it was straight into the water. There was no-where near as much messing around with things like briefings as there is with Scuba Junkie so we were in the water for the first dive at Barracuda Point by just after 6:15. Second dive was at West Ridge, third at South Point and the fourth back at Barracuda Point. We registered and had breakfast after the first dive. Lunch was between the third and fourth. The dives are slightly shorter than with Scuba Junkie as are the surface intervals so it was a relatively short day and we left Sipadan before 2pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All the dives were good today without being as spectacular as dives can be at Sipadan. I think we were at a slight disadvantage having the Chinese girls in our group. They were not experienced and could not cope with swimming into current meaning that on a couple of occasions, we had to turn round when the other group kept going to better parts of the sites.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-253.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">On the first dive we did not see the barracuda or jacks that are usually at this site but the vis was good, there were plenty of fish and we saw about 13 sharks. Second dive we went looking for the school of jacks but did not find them. We did see one of the biggest Napoleon wrasse we have ever seen. We found the jacks on the third dive. Roz had spotted  a school of them in the shallows. We did not go up to them but found another big school (or the same school had moved) further along the reef. These were spectacular and one of the highlights of the day but again, not as spectacular as the huge school that used to be at Barracuda Point. Fourth dive was very sharky. There were loads of sharks moving around beneath us for a lot of the dive making them hard to count but Roz reckoned there were about twenty of them. There was a lot of activity at the end of the dive with more sharks, lots of giant travally and finally a few turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Not a great day for turtle spotting. The tide was high when we got there and although it did drop, it was not low enough for the really good turtle dives we have had here in the past. Roz counted two, five, five and four on the four dives. Not too bad a total but very low for a days diving at Sipadan. However, right at the end of the fourth dive, there was a turtle on Turtle Rock which was good to see!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not do a lot when we got back to the resort. We were both worn out so spent the afternoon either on the balcony or catching up on sleep. Went to dinner at the same time as yesterday but there was a lot more food tonight. Another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th March</span>
            We had three boat dives for today included in our package. We also have unlimited dives on the house reef on our own so decided to get up early and do a sunrise dive before breakfast. We were in the water by 5:50 and had the reef totally to ourselves. We saw the frog-fish again and plenty of nudibranchs but still could not find the ghost pipe fish. There was plenty of early morning fish activity and Roz saw one green turtle.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were on the boat for the second dive which was at Eel Garden on Mabul. We were led by Joshua again and had three other divers in our group. Everyone we dived with yesterday were on different boats and there were no Chinese at all on the boat. It was a good dive with better vis than we are used to on Mabul. Again, there were a lot of nudibranchs, plenty of fish and one hawksbill turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had considered only doing one boat dive and doing another couple of dives on the house reef instead but after this one, decided to do the next boat dive as well. We returned to the resort for an hour and were back out on the boat at 10:30. This dive was back at Mabul at Lobster Wall. It was a very good dive again with seven turtles and a stone-fish. After lunch, we had an hour or so back in the room. Most of the time we could see turtles in the water beneath the balcony with at least five of them eating at one point. The balcony and the room in general has been one of the best of the entire trip. We have always liked Scuba Junkie but it is going to be very tempting to come back to Kapali if we come back to the area again. The short dive times have been compensated for by long dives on the house reef, the dive staff have been great and the accommodation is a definite step up.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-254.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The last dive of the day and our last dive from Kapalai was just the two of us on the house reef again. This was another very good dive. We had been told about another frog fish and ghost pipe fish. We spent quite a bit of time looking for them without success but did find a long nose hawk fish on the same structure. All three of the biggest structures had turtles on them. The turtles were incredibly laid back dozing on the roofs of the structures oblivious to the schools of fish and hunting jacks all around them. We went back to the frog fish at the other end of the site before ending the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the dive we washed our gear and took it back to the balcony in an attempt to dry it before we leave tomorrow. We had a few drinks on our balcony either side of dinner. Nothing too excessive as we have another early start tomorrow but it was a very nice place to sit and drink even if it was Malaysian vodka mixed with orange squash! Food was very good again tonight. As with last night, there was plenty left but the staff still kept bringing us more plates. Got to bed around 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 29th March</span>
            We were awake just before 6:00 for our 6:30 departure to Mabul. Boats leave Kapalai for Semporna at 6:30, 10:30 and 14:30. We needed to get to Mabul by 9:00 so had to get the 6:30 boat. It was only a ten minute journey to Mabul so by 6:45 we were on Scuba Junkie's pier. We walked up to the resort and sat in the restaurant until reception opened at 7:30. We had breakfast and were able to check in to our room straight away as it was vacant last night. The room we stayed in last time was not available so we are in the one next door. There were quite a few familiar faces around in the restaurant although Nik was not there as she is suffering from what sounds like serious back problems. We also bumped into Waldo again when we went to our room although he was heading back to Semporna this morning so we will not see him again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We put our stuff in the room and had about an hour to kill before we needed to be on the jetty for our first dive. Diving on the first day here can be slightly different to other days as the people on the boat are all new arrivals whereas on other days it is more based on experience. This meant that there were a lot of very inexperienced divers on the boat, half of whom seemed incapable of sorting out their weight belts let alone anything else. We were in a group with an American woman who was pretty poor underwater and needed constant supervision and Julia, an Austrian who was a lot better. On all the dives, Alam our guide had to hold on to the American or have her hold on to him meaning the two of us and Julia were left to ourselves. On the third dive, he took her up after 38 minutes before rejoining us later in the dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-255.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We did all three dives around Mabul with the first two at Stingray City and Artificial Reef. When everyone was asked to choose where to do the third dive, no-one on the boat apart from us was keen on the muck diving which Mabul is famous for so we went to Eel Garden. Awas will have to wait until tomorrow! The dives were all very good with good vis all day. We saw eight turtles on the first and third dives, a ghost pipe fish on the second and plenty of nudibranchs and fish on all three sites. As with yesterday, the current was quite strong in places so we drifted quite a long way on both the first and third dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It has been "Shark Week" at Mabul this week with a series of presentations and projects organised by Dave who we know from diving here in 2013. Tonights talk was about coral conservation and we went up to watch it after eating. There was also a talk about the crown of thorns problem that they have here and what they are trying to do to solve it. All quite interesting without anything too exciting and we were back in the room by 9.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th March</span>
            We were supposed to be on the 8:30 boat this morning but a couple of people did not turn up so we did not leave the jetty until after 9:00. We had asked to be guided by Khai and we were joined by Julia again as she had asked to dive with us and not with the American woman from yesterday. There were only four other divers on the boat so plenty of space.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-256.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was back at Kapalai House Reef. We were able to show Khai the frog fish that we had already seen and the ornate ghost pipe fish that we had seen on our first dive here but had not seen since. Khai then found a tiny frog fish, another couple of ghost pipe fish and a flamboyant cuttle fish on the reef.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Little Okinawa. This dive was pretty good again with plenty to see. The  afternoon dive was an 82 minute dive at Awas. This is Khai's favourite site and diving there with him is always good. As usual there was a huge amount of things to see including three frog fish, dragonets, cuttle fish, a tiny flamboyant cuttle fish, squid and a few turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Khai had done a night dive here yesterday which sounded very good so for the first time in Mabul we returned to Awas for a night dive. Roz, Julia and myself were joined by Jonathon which was a shame as he used his air quicker than the rest of us which led to a shorter dive (still 73 minutes). We went in as it was getting dark just after six and it was another very good dive. Last night they saw seven frog fish. We only saw four tonight but we did see one of them eat a fish that was about twice the size of itself. Both Roz and I thought that it was the frog fish that was being eaten by the bigger fish but then saw the whole fish disappear into the very bloated looking frog fish. Plenty of other stuff to see as well. Definitely a better than average night dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not finish eating until after 8:00 and went straight upstairs to watch the last event of Shark Week, a documentary film about conservation. Again, it was reasonably interesting. We had considered having a few drinks and watching the football but by the time the film had finished and we had talked to a couple of people it was getting late so we returned to the room to sort out photos and cameras for tomorrow. Roz went to sleep but I managed to stay awake for the football results at 1am.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 31st March</span>
            Three dives around Mabul today. We were diving with Simon today as Khai was in Sipadan. Suddenly there do not seem to be as many people around so it was just us and Hans & Ulrika on our boat this morning. First dive was at Second Wall. There were loads of nudibranchs around at the start of the dive at about 25m. There was less to see in the shallower parts of the dive but still a good dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive started at Nudi Nook and ended back at Awas. There was not so much to see at Nudi Nook but we did see about six turtles before we got to Awas. At Awas, we found the two frog fish that we had seen at the start of yesterday's dive and a third nearby. Third dive of the day after lunch was another close site - Paradise in front of Borneo Divers. This was another good site. We did not see as much as on Awas but we did see another two giant frog fish, the first of which I found.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I had to spend an hour or so sorting out my car insurance when we got back as I take ownership of my car again tomorrow. We had a later evening than usual here. We stayed around in the restaurant talking to people who had been on our dive boat until about 9 and then went back to the room for a couple of drinks. Tonight was the Checkatrade Trophy final between Sunderland and Portsmouth which kicked off at 21:30 local time. The game was not on any of the satellite television channels that they have in the bar but we went up there anyway for a few drinks and to follow the game on the internet. The WiFi here is not good enough for streaming games but we were able to follow what was going with Flash Scores and the SMB. We left the bar just after midnight after Sunderland had lost on penalties.
