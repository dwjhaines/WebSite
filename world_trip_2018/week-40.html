            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 18th - Wednesday 20th, February</span>
            Three more days of not doing much. Days sent by the pool and evenings spent drinking too much, apart from Monday when we had a night off. We ate at Sunset Point on Monday and Tuesday but it was closed on Wednesday so we ate further down the beach.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 21st, February</span>
            We stayed in the room until we checked out just before midday. On Tuesday, we had booked a taxi to take us to Ranong. We had looked at other options but going from Nai Yang, a taxi was by far the easiest way. The 260km journey took about four and a half hours and cost Baht 4,000. We are heading to Ranong for a couple of live-aboard dive trips the first of which departs tomorrow.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got to Ranong by 4:30 and checked into the "b-ranong". We went straight out to the Smiling Seahorse office to check about the money we need for tomorrow, got something to eat and walked back to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel had a DVD player in the room so we were able to watch Mama Mia, Here We Go Again before going out to eat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at The Farmhouse which is just down the road from where we were staying. Good Thai food with a couple of wheat beers and back in the room by 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 22st, February</span>
            We had a few things to sort out this morning. First we took all our dive gear to the Smiling Seahorse office when it opened at 9:00. We also dropped off the luggage we are taking on the boat with us and filled out all the paperwork for the trip. We handed over the money for our visas and park entry fees ($280 each) mainly in US$ but we did have to make up $110 in Baht due to one of our $100 notes having a tear in it and us being $10 short anyway.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">With all that done, we stopped for breakfast and returned to the b to pack. We filled my suitcase with the stuff we are not taking on the live-aboard and then went out again. I walked to the Tinidee Hotel which is where we will be staying when we get back to Renong and left my suitcase in their luggage room. Roz walked out to the bus station to buy our bus tickets back to Khao Lak for a couple of weeks time. Getting the bus from here should be easier as it starts here and it is easy for us to get to the bus station. We were both back at the hotel by about 11:15. Time for showers before checking out at midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We sat around in reception using the Wi-Fi until about 12:45 and then walked to The Farmhouse where we were due to be picked up from at 14:00. We had lunch there and were eventually picked up at about 14:30 along with the other 14 guests. We had to be driven first to the Thai immigration offices so that we could be stamped out of the country. We were then taken to the pier where the new Smiling Seahorse boat was moored. We were dropped right by the boat and all got straight aboard.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-220.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived with Smiling Seahorse on a similar trip last February. Since then, they have bought a new boat. We really liked the old one but the new one has air-conditioned, en-suite cabins which is an improvement. The first trip we are doing on the new boat is a seven night trip into Myanmar, very similar to the one we did last year. We will also do a second, shorted trip to Thai dive sites a couple of days after this one ends.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once on the boat, we were given our boat briefing by Frank while we crossed the river to Kawthaung, the Myanmar border town. We moored for the Myanmar immigration officials to come aboard and complete their passport stamping.... and to collect the US$280 per person! We were shown to our cabins while this was going on. Cabins are very nice and a bit more light and spacious than on the old boat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were introduced to our guide (Julien) and the other couple we will be diving with - Marshall from Chester and Noi who is Thai. Apart from unpacking and meeting a few other guests we did not do much until dinner at 8. As with last year, the food was very good - they still have the same kitchen crew. We were back in the cabin just after 9 as the boat continued its way North towards the first dive site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 23rd, February</span>
            We were woken at 6:00 for breakfast 1 and a 6:30 dive briefing. First dive was supposed to be at 7:00 but we were the fourth group in the water meaning that it was closer to 8:00 by the time we went in the water. As well as the five of us, Camille, Frank's wife, started the dive with us although she left us after about ten minutes.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-221.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive at Rocky Island was not great. The vis was really poor and we lost Roz after about 40 minutes meaning an early end to the dive. The second dive at Dragon Island was better as we did see a few more things and we managed to finish the dive with the same number of divers that we started with. However the vis was still terrible, there was a lot of surge and the dive was no-where near as good as the one at the same site last year. One of the main features of the island is the three underwater tunnels that you can swim through. It was not possible to swim through them today. It would not have been safe and with no vis, it was fairly pointless even trying.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch we had a change of plan and headed West for a couple of hours in search of somewhere with better conditions. This meant doing an "exploratory dive" at a site that no-one on the  boat had dived before. This proved to be a good move and we had the best dive of the day here. The site - South Twin - was a spectacular boulder type site with plenty of fish but, most importantly, good visibility again. I think the conditions this morning were exceptionally bad for this area so it was a relief to get back to what we were expecting. Noi dropped out of this dive (headache) but Camille stayed with us for the whole dive this time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The fourth dive on this boat is always a night dive. It was just me, Roz and Marcus on this dive with Julien. It was a better than average night dive and also the longest dive of the day at 66 minutes. As well as the usual crabs and shrimps, we saw a tiny pygmy cuttle fish, a bob-tail squid, a few other cuttle fish and squid and quite a few large morays out hunting. It was almost 9pm by the time we had showered and gone upstairs for dinner so were not back in the room until about 9:45.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 24th, February</span>
            All the dives today were in the same area, the first three with negative entries as the sites were completely submerged. The first two were at North Twin Pinnacle, the third at North Twin Reef and the night dive at Blood Moon Bay. Noi just did the first two dives again, Camille joined us on the second, third and fourth. The first two dives were good with plenty of fish around. The pinnacle is completely submerged with the top at about 13m. Everyone was hoping to see bigger fish but there was not a lot of current so it was mainly big schools of smaller fish. We saw an ornate ghost pipe fish and a sea-horse on the second dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive on the reef was another very fishy dive but we also had manta rays on this one. Everyone in our group except me had a brief sighting of one not long after we got in the water but about halfway through the dive we all had a better sighting of a bigger one. The vis is still not great and it was not a long encounter but it was still a spectacular sight as it swam above us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was similar to yesterday's. Not as many cuttle fish or squid but we did see our second ornate ghost pipe fish of the day. Almost 10 o'clock by the time we were back in the cabin tonight!
