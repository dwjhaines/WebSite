            We were awake just before 5am. Time for a quick shower and a couple of slices of toast before heading to the jetty for a final time. We were on the 5:30 boat with Nick, Laura, Richard, Rachel and Rachel's mum as well as an Indonesian couple. The boat journey was fairly smooth although there was about 10 minutes where it became choppy and another 10 - 15 minutes where we had very heavy rain. We arrived back in Tarakan at about 8:15.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There were cars waiting to meet us at the port and we were at the airport about 20 minutes later. At the airport, there was a woman trying to get everyone into a lounge. Usually we would not bother but it was only Rp90,000 (about £4.50) and most of the others (all except Laura) were going for it. I managed to get my Indonesian SIM working again before we went in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For our £4.50, we got unlimited food and (non-alcoholic) drinks. They also took our luggage, checked us all in and bought us our boarding passes. We had a couple of hours of good food, cold drinks, good coffee (for those that had been missing it), air-conditioning and internet access. Total luxury! The 11:35 MAS Wings flight back to Tawau was on time and only took about 30 minutes so we were back in Tawau with plenty of time for our connecting flight. We had to clear immigration and collect our luggage at Tawau before checking in. Everything went fairly smoothly and we were back sat in the departure area with an hour or so to spare before our 14:20 Air Asia flight to KL. This also left on time and we landed back at KLIA 2 at 17:10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had already cleared immigration at Tawau so we just had to collect our luggage and head for the train station. We had decided to go in by train as although more expensive than the bus, it is a lot quicker, particularly at this time of night. The train took just over half an hour and we then had a 10 - 15 minute walk to our hotel. We were given an upgrade on the room we had booked and have a suite type thing with sitting and kitchen areas. It all seems very luxurious after the last three weeks!
