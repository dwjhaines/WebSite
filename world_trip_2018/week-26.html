            We were awake just before 5am. Time for a quick shower and a couple of slices of toast before heading to the jetty for a final time. We were on the 5:30 boat with Nick, Laura, Richard, Rachel and Rachel's mum as well as an Indonesian couple. The boat journey was fairly smooth although there was about 10 minutes where it became choppy and another 10 - 15 minutes where we had very heavy rain. We arrived back in Tarakan at about 8:15.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There were cars waiting to meet us at the port and we were at the airport about 20 minutes later. At the airport, there was a woman trying to get everyone into a lounge. Usually we would not bother but it was only Rp90,000 (about £4.50) and most of the others (all except Laura) were going for it. I managed to get my Indonesian SIM working again before we went in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For our £4.50, we got unlimited food and (non-alcoholic) drinks. They also took our luggage, checked us all in and bought us our boarding passes. We had a couple of hours of good food, cold drinks, good coffee (for those that had been missing it), air-conditioning and internet access. Total luxury! The 11:35 MAS Wings flight back to Tawau was on time and only took about 30 minutes so we were back in Tawau with plenty of time for our connecting flight. We had to clear immigration and collect our luggage at Tawau before checking in. Everything went fairly smoothly and we were back sat in the departure area with an hour or so to spare before our 14:20 Air Asia flight to KL. This also left on time and we landed back at KLIA 2 at 17:10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had already cleared immigration at Tawau so we just had to collect our luggage and head for the train station. We had decided to go in by train as although more expensive than the bus, it is a lot quicker, particularly at this time of night. The train took just over half an hour to KL Sentral and we then had a 10 - 15 minute walk to our hotel. We were given an upgrade on the room we had booked and have a suite type thing with sitting and kitchen areas. It all seems very luxurious after the accommodation of the last three weeks!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We are staying in the Brickfields area of Kuala Lumpa for two reasons. Firstly it is handy for Sentral station, the main transport hub of KL. Secondly, the area is known as Little India as there is a large Indian community here meaning there are lots of Indian restaurants. We picked one at random and had the best meal we have had since leaving home just over three weeks ago. Back in the hotel by about 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 13th November</span>
            We went back over to the Indian restaurants to get out roti canai for breakfast and then spent most of the rest of the day trying to sort out our cameras. There were a couple of places in KL that indicated on their websites that they may be able to do on the spot camera repairs or at least tell us if it was possible to repair them. We were fairly optimistic about getting Roz's fixed but thought it unlikely that mine would ever work again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 9:30 and got the mono-rail out to Imbi. There was a Canon Service Centre there that seemed the best bet but when we eventually found the place, they told us that they service just about every Canon product except cameras. They gave us directions to their main office which was the opposite end of KL which was not ideal. We knew of another place we could try but were not sure how to get there as we had assumed that Canon would be able to help us. Near the service centre there were a lot of camera shops and we did find that the camera I nearly bought before coming out, the Olympus TG5, was available in a few places with underwater housing for about £80 less than at home so we do have this as an option. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit stuck at this point as we had no internet access so returned to the hotel as it was on the way to the address given to us by Canon. We stopped to buy phone credit so we could get internet access while out and about and then went back to use the hotel Wi-Fi. We found phone numbers of Canon customer support and the shop whose web-site stated they do 1 hour repairs for simple problems. Both of these proved to be dead-ends as Canon said that the camera is too old and they no longer support it and the other shop said they would need the camera for three days. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-139.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Resigned to the fact that the cameras are not going to be repaired, Roz started looking on Australian eBay. She found an S95 in Townsville and an S100 in Melbourne. We spent an hour or so trying to buy the cameras. I think we have been successful with the S95. We got the seller to add a "Buy it Now" option and we have paid for the camera. It should be delivered to our Cairns hotel in the next few days. We were unable to do the same for the S100 so will have to bid for that and hope we can pick it up in Melbourne on Sunday. This will involve us having to drive a bit out of our way but not a big problem if it works.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not make it out for lunch until about 3:30. After we had eaten, we went out for a walk around KL. There was nothing we really wanted to see as we have been here before but we walked up past the main railway station to Central market and from there into Chinatown. Nothing too exciting and the whole area seemed even more run down than when we last stayed there about 23 years ago. We got the train back from Chinatown to Sentral.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were  in no hurry to eat in the evening due to the late lunch. I went out to get my hair cut and bought back a few beers which we drank in the room before going out to eat at 9ish. We had another excellent curry before another couple of beers back at the hotel.
