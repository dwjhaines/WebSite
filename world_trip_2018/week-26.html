            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 12th November</span>
            We were awake just before 5am. Time for a quick shower and a couple of slices of toast before heading to the jetty for a final time. We were on the 5:30 boat with Nick, Laura, Richard, Rachel and Rachel's mum as well as an Indonesian couple. The boat journey was fairly smooth although there was about 10 minutes where it became choppy and another 10 - 15 minutes where we had very heavy rain. We arrived back in Tarakan at about 8:15.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There were cars waiting to meet us at the port and we were at the airport about 20 minutes later. At the airport, there was a woman trying to get everyone into a lounge. Usually we would not bother but it was only Rp90,000 (about £4.50) and most of the others (all except Laura) were going for it. I managed to get my Indonesian SIM working again before we went in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For our £4.50, we got unlimited food and (non-alcoholic) drinks. They also took our luggage, checked us all in and bought us our boarding passes. We had a couple of hours of good food, cold drinks, good coffee (for those that had been missing it), air-conditioning and internet access. Total luxury! The 11:35 MAS Wings flight back to Tawau was on time and only took about 30 minutes so we were back in Tawau with plenty of time for our connecting flight. We had to clear immigration and collect our luggage at Tawau before checking in. Everything went fairly smoothly and we were back sat in the departure area with an hour or so to spare before our 14:20 Air Asia flight to KL. This also left on time and we landed back at KLIA 2 at 17:10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had already cleared immigration at Tawau so we just had to collect our luggage and head for the train station. We had decided to go in by train as although more expensive than the bus, it is a lot quicker, particularly at this time of night. The train took just over half an hour to KL Sentral and we then had a 10 - 15 minute walk to our hotel. We were given an upgrade on the room we had booked and have a suite type thing with sitting and kitchen areas. It all seems very luxurious after the accommodation of the last three weeks!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We are staying in the Brickfields area of Kuala Lumpa for two reasons. Firstly it is handy for Sentral station, the main transport hub of KL. Secondly, the area is known as Little India as there is a large Indian community here meaning there are lots of Indian restaurants. We picked one at random and had the best meal we have had since leaving home just over three weeks ago. Back in the hotel by about 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 13th November</span>
            We went back over to the Indian restaurants to get out roti canai for breakfast and then spent most of the rest of the day trying to sort out our cameras. There were a couple of places in KL that indicated on their websites that they may be able to do on the spot camera repairs or at least tell us if it was possible to repair them. We were fairly optimistic about getting Roz's fixed but thought it unlikely that mine would ever work again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 9:30 and got the mono-rail out to Imbi. There was a Canon Service Centre there that seemed the best bet but when we eventually found the place, they told us that they service just about every Canon product except cameras. They gave us directions to their main office which was the opposite end of KL which was not ideal. We knew of another place we could try but were not sure how to get there as we had assumed that Canon would be able to help us. Near the service centre there were a lot of camera shops and we did find that the camera I nearly bought before coming out, the Olympus TG5, was available in a few places with underwater housing for about £80 less than at home so we do have this as an option. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit stuck at this point as we had no internet access so returned to the hotel as it was on the way to the address given to us by Canon. We stopped to buy phone credit so we could get internet access while out and about and then went back to use the hotel Wi-Fi. We found phone numbers of Canon customer support and the shop whose web-site stated they do 1 hour repairs for simple problems. Both of these proved to be dead-ends as Canon said that the camera is too old and they no longer support it and the other shop said they would need the camera for three days. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-139.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Resigned to the fact that the cameras are not going to be repaired, Roz started looking on Australian eBay. She found an S95 in Townsville and an S100 in Melbourne. We spent an hour or so trying to buy the cameras. I think we have been successful with the S95. We got the seller to add a "Buy it Now" option and we have paid for the camera. It should be delivered to our Cairns hotel in the next few days. We were unable to do the same for the S100 so will have to bid for that and hope we can pick it up in Melbourne on Sunday. This will involve us having to drive a bit out of our way but not a big problem if it works.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not make it out for lunch until about 3:30. After we had eaten, we went out for a walk around KL. There was nothing we really wanted to see as we have been here before but we walked up past the main railway station to Central market and from there into Chinatown. Nothing too exciting and the whole area seemed even more run down than when we last stayed there about 23 years ago. We got the train back from Chinatown to Sentral.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were  in no hurry to eat in the evening due to the late lunch. I went out to get my hair cut and bought back a few beers which we drank in the room before going out to eat at 9ish. We had another excellent curry before another couple of beers back at the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 14th November</span>
            We did not leave the room until we had to check out at midday. Spent the morning sorting out photos, looking into options for later in the trip and generally making the most of the nicest room we have stayed in for a while. At midday, we checked out, left our luggage in the hotel and walked back to Sentral, stopping for breakfast on the way. At Sentral, we managed to change the £35 of rubles we had inadvertently left Russia with at a much better rate than we expected to get anywhere (i.e. we actually got £35 for them).
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got the mono-rail to Imbi again and went back to the shopping centre we had been to yesterday. This time, we bought a TG5 and the underwater case. This means that whatever happens we will have at least one camera for Australia and should both have one if the one we bought from ebay gets delivered successfully. The price was £20 less than it was yesterday for some reason so overall, about £100 less than we would have paid at home.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-140.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked over the road to another, very festive shopping centre for an ice-cream while deciding what to do for the rest of the day. We decided to continue our sight-seeing by walking to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. The area is quite interesting with loads of old colonial buildings surrounded by modern sky-scrapers. As with yesterday, we found that the city is not really designed for pedestrians and walking anywhere is not easy. We got the train back to Sentral, had roti canai for a late lunch and went to sit back in the hotel reception for a couple of hours. We already knew that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes until 22:20 so we were not in any great hurry.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We reluctantly left the hotel just before 7pm. Neither of us have been particularly impressed with what we have seen of KL but the hotel has been brilliant and the food in this area has been excellent. We walked back to Sentral Station and got the KLIA Express back to the airport. Check-in was fairly quick but immigration painfully slow again. However we were still through with plenty of time. Burger King was about the only place in the airport that was not ridiculously expensive so we sat in there for about an hour before buying our duty free and walking to the gate. The flight left at the predicted delayed time of 22:20. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 15th November</span>
            We arrived in Melbourne eight hours later at about 9am local time. Neither of us had managed to get much sleep due to two screaming kids in the seats behind us who kept us awake for most of the night. When we did arrive, for some reason the plane did not get space at the terminal and we all had to be bussed in. It was quite a big plane and we were sat at the back so it was about 50 minutes between landing and getting to the terminal. Immigration was quite quick and our luggage was waiting for us when we got through but we were still not outside the airport until 10:30.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got a bus out to the hire car offices and collected the car we will have for the next week. Getting the car took more time as we had to register to pay for the toll roads that both Melbourne and Sydney now have. It took about 45 minutes to drive into the centre of Melbourne and we found our hotel without too many problems. We have an apartment that is about a third of the size of the one we had in KL but it is central and will be fine for a couple of nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had considered diving this afternoon or at least driving out to the dive centre to collect tanks so we could start early tomorrow. However, a combination of a lack of sleep and everything taking slightly longer than expected this morning meant that we put everything off until tomorrow morning. Instead, we went out and spent a few hours wandering round Melbourne.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started off with Victoria Market which is just round the corner from where we are staying. This was all a bit tacky but entertaining enough for half an hour or so. We walked from there down Elizabeth Street one of the main shopping streets. We went to another camera shop where they looked at Roz's camera again. This time they reckoned that they could fix it but it would take at least a month to get the part or it would cost AU$300 if they took the part from another camera. We decided not to bother and to wait and see what happens with ebay.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued down Elizabeth Street to Flinders Street Station and from there to Federation Square. The station was the more impressive of the two sights. We got back to the room by about 4:00 and I went out again to buy an Australian SIM card so that we have data access for the next few weeks.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-141.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go out to St. Kilda pier this evening to see the penguins. There are two large colonies of little penguins near Melbourne (they really are called little penguins as they are the smallest breed of penguin). We are planning on visiting the one made famous in the Penguin Island documentary on Saturday but there is a smaller colony that you can visit for free just South of Melbourne. We nearly did not go as we were both tired but we made the effort and were rewarded with another superb experience.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got the tram out to St Kilda at about 6:00 and were at the pier about an hour later. The best time to go apparently is about an hour after sunset when a lot of the little penguins come out onto the rocks. We were there before sunset. Although not as many, there were quite a few around and you could get really close up to them. We stayed for about an hour and a half watching them. By the time the sun had set, it was getting very cold and there were a lot more tourists around. We do not have warm enough clothes for the weather in Melbourne at the moment so gave up and returned on the tram to the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we were back, we were cold hungry and very tired. Neither of us felt like eating out so we bought ham, cheese and French bread and returned to our apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 16th November</span>
            We had arranged to dive at Flinders Pier today in an attempt to see weedy sea dragons. These had featured on Blue Planet II and the weedy sea dragons scene was filmed at Flinders. You only get them in this part of Australia and Flinders Pier is the place where there are more of them than anywhere else.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-142.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the apartment at about 8:15 and headed out of Melbourne. We got to Rowville just after 9:00 and drove to Aquatic Adventures who we had arranged to hire tanks, weights and wetsuits from. The water here is a lot colder than we are used and our 2.5mm short wetsuits would not be anywhere near warm enough. Instead we hired 7mm full length suits. This all took half an hour or so to sort out and we then had another drive of almost an hour to get to Flinders. We geared up in the car park and had a couple of minutes walk down to the beach for a fairly easy entry into the water. We had a few issues going down at the start of the dive - the water felt freezing and we probably could have done with another weight each but we were eventually underwater by about 11:20.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been told by a few people that the best time to dive this site was at high tide. High tide this morning was at 6:15 which is why we had planned to pick up tanks yesterday. Going in at 11:20 meant that we would be diving at low tide.However, this did not turn out to be a problem. It meant that we had a very shallow dive - max depth 3.4m, average depth 2.4m but we had a very enjoyable 74 minutes underwater. And for most of that time we were looking at weedy sea dragons! We were expecting to see them but were still surprised at how easy they were to find and how many of them there were. I still have a few things to work out with the new camera but was able to get some good photos of them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The weather was a bit better than we had been expecting when we got back to the car park so we were able to dry ourselves and our equipment a bit before putting it back into the car. We returned the equipment to Rowville and, after a lunch and supermarket stop, drove back to Melbourne. We were back at the apartment just before 5:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showering, we had a couple of drinks while looking at the days pictures before going out to a BYO Thai restaurant that was just round the corner from where we were staying. We had planned to go and see the Melbourne skyline which is quite spectacular at night but a second bottle of wine put an end to that and we went to the nearest pub after eating instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 17th November</span>
            We checked out of the apartment at 10:00 and headed South out of Melbourne for the second day running. We had a two hour drive down to San Remo which is the last town before Phillip Island and a cheaper place to stay than on the island itself. Our room was not ready when we arrived but was by the time we had visited the supermarket for things to make sandwiches for lunch and tea. We had lunch, an hour or so sleeping and went out to see the sights of Phillip Island by about 3pm.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-143.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First stop was the Koala Conservation Centre. This is a nature preserve with boardwalk trails allowing for views of koalas. We were not that impressed initially as the koalas that we first saw were just sleeping high up in trees. After we had seen a few more close up and seen one or two moving around a bit we both agreed that it had been worth visiting.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove from here to Nobbies Centre at the far end of the island. This was another area with a lot of boardwalks, this time they were overlooking what is quite a spectacular coast. We were hoping to view seals here but apparently, this is not the best time of year for them and you need binoculars anyway. Still the scenery was good to look at. We bought a few things from the souvenir shop and proceeded towards Penguin Parade, the main reason for us coming here. We stopped to eat our sandwiches on the way and found out that we had won the ebay auction for an S100 which we can pick up in Melbourne tomorrow. The camera situation is starting to look a lot better than it was a week ago!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had booked a guided ranger tour at the Penguin Parade. We met up with our ranger at 7:45 with eight other people. We had a talk for about 15 minutes before being led down to the beach where 100's of little penguins come ashore every night after being out to sea fishing. They started coming ashore at 8:30 and we spent about 30 minutes watching them all waddling up the beach. It had been worth paying extra for the ranger tour, not just because of the tour, but our viewing area was much closer to where most of the penguins came up the beach than if we had been in the general viewing area. This was all excellent to watch. We walked back to the visitor centre and had very good close up views of the penguins as they walked along beside the boardwalk and again as they stood around at the back of the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tour finished by about 9:30 and we had a half hour drive back to the motel.
