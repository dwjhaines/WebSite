            Chocolate croissants on the balcony for breakfast and we then spent a while sorting our luggage out. We are flying to Rhodes this afternoon and can only take hand luggage as we did not want to pay the extra â‚¬18 each way to put a bag in the hold. We checked out of the hotel at 11:00 and had a ten minute drive to the airport parking place we had booked a few weeks ago. This all went very smoothly and we were at the airport with boarding passes printed before midday. We finished the remains of yesterdays pizza and went through security to wait for the 14:00 Aegean flight to Rhodes.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-084.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The flight left just about on time and we landed in Rhodes at about 15:15. Getting through the airport was remarkably quick and we were able to get the 15:45 bus into the centre of Rhodes town. We are staying just outside the old town, a few minutes walk from the end of the bus route.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We checked in to the hotel, dropped our stuff in the room and went straight out again. We had booked our ferry tickets for the next couple of weeks on-line before leaving home but needed to collect them from the Dodekanisos Seaways office at the port. The port area is all quite scenic on the edge of the old town. We saw the windmills at the harbour before picking up the tickets and then headed into the old town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The old town was also quite nice and not too crowded with tourists by the time we went in. We wandered along the Street of The Knights of Rhodes which goes through the centre of the most historic part of the town. We had a look at a few of the buildings before walking back to the hotel via a supermarket to buy provisions to take to the islands with us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got a message from Regan as we were getting back to the hotel saying that he had landed in Rhodes. We had a bottle of retsina on our balcony while we waited for him to sort himself out and went out to meet him at about 8:30. We went to a taverna near the bus station and he turned up as sweaty as ever about ten minutes after us. We were then given the news that the reason for Annette not coming as well is that she is pregnant and is expecting a baby in March. Once we had recovered from the shock of hearing this, we had a pretty good evening. We had a good meal with a few jugs of wine/retsina. It was a relatively early night as we have an early start tomorrow and we were back in the hotel by midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st August</span>
            We were up at 7:00, had breakfast in the hotel and checked out by 7:30. It was only a ten minute walk to the port where we boarded the ferry to Tilos. Regan joined us on the boat which left just about on time at 8:30. We arrived in Tilos just before 11:00. As with last night, Regan is not staying in the same place as us as he booked too late so we split up and walked to our hotels. We managed to miss the path to ours (Marina's Studios) so getting there involved a bit of a climb up the side of the hill but we were in our room by 11:30. This is another apartment with excellent views of the village below and the beach.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a look around the village before it got too hot. It is a small village but quite pretty with plenty of tavernas dotted around small squares. We bought food for lunch and returned to the room via a slightly easier route to the first time. We had lunch on the balcony and headed down to the beach with Regan (who is staying about 200m away).
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-085.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The beach is about a ten minute walk away. I left Roz and Regan on the beach and went for a walk of about six miles round one of the bays. This was far nicer than walking in the Tsagarada area. The paths were nowhere near as steep, they were in far better condition and there was spectacular scenery to look at most of the way round. Also from when I left the beach to when I got back, I did not see a single other person. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I got back to the beach just after 5:00 and stayed half an hour or so before walking back to the hotel. Regan came and joined us on our balcony for a drink before going out to eat. He could not remember where he had eaten last time he was on Tilos so we chose a taverna in the centre that looked good and ate there. Before we ordered food, Regan, who did not know that today was the day of Annette's first scan, discovered by text that they are expecting twins. We had another very good meal before moving on to another taverna for a few retsinas. All ended up very drunk!

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd August</span>
            Did not do much all morning apart from a trip down to the supermarket to buy water (you can not drink the tap water here). After lunch on the balcony, I went for a walk again while Roz and Regan sat on the beach. I did the same walk as yesterday but kept going for another mile or so to get to an abandoned medieval village called Gera. Had I known about Gera yesterday, I would have kept going then but only read about it last night. The village itself was not too exciting but the location still made it quite spectacular and the walk was very enjoyable again. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">I was back on the beach just after 5:00 and spent half an hour recovering before going back to the hotel. We had a similar evening to yesterday. This time we went along to Regan's hotel for drinks on the balcony before walking down to the same taverna. Another good meal and a slightly earlier and more sober night as we did not move on to the other taverna after we had finished eating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 23rd August</span>
            We were awake a bit earlier today. We checked out at 10:00 and were driven down to the port by Marina, the owner of the studios, for the 10:35 ferry to Kos. We met Regan at the port and departed 25 minutes late at 11:00.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-087.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were in Kos just before 13:00 and had a short wait for the 13:30 ferry to Kalimnos. This was a journey of one hour so we arrived in Kalimnos at about 14:30. We are staying on the smaller island of Telendos. To get here, we got a taxi to a pier on the other side of the island. We met Hoggy and Sarah again on the pier and the five of us crossed to Telendos on the small boat that goes every 30 minutes.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">At Telendos, it was a 500m walk to Hotel Porto Potha where we have a studio apartment and another room booked for two nights (Regan booked too late and is staying somewhere else again). After a bit of confusion over who was having which room (we had booked the apartment but got given the room), we had lunch on our balcony and spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had drinks on our balcony before going out. Regan had booked a table at the taverna where they had eaten last time they were here for 9:00. A good meal again while getting through six litres of wine. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 24th August</span>
            An uneventful day. An hour or so by the pool in the morning, lunch on the balcony and an hour or so on a small beach at the other side of the island in the afternoon. We returned to the same taverna as yesterday and had a very similar evening.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th August</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at 9:30 and got the 10:00 boat back across to Kalimnos. We had booked taxis to meet us and were at the port by 10:30. We had time to go the supermarket and have breakfast before getting the 11:40 Dodekanisos Express to Lipsi.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Lipsi about 10 minutes late at 13:10. It was a short walk from the port to Rena's Rooms. This is the place Hoggy and Sarah stay at just about every year. We have three of her four rooms booked for the next five nights.
            </p>
