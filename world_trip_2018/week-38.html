            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 4th February</span>
            A very similar day to yesterday. There were a few more people on the boat today. There were two open water students with Ken and we also had a Dutch couple who had arrived last night with us. There were three guides so we were on our own with Nanus again. First dive was at Fukui. This was a bit different to most of the steep wall sites at Bunaken and was more of a slope. Still a very spectacular site with nice hard coral and plenty to see. We saw four turtles including one large hawksbill, a big school of batfish which could have done with being a bit lower, a couple of Napoleon wrasse and an electric clam.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Muka Kampung which is the next site along from Lekuan. Really, it is a continuation of the same wall and a very similar dive. This was another excellent dive with a total of 25 green turtles. We have dived this site twice before in 2007 and 2008. On those dives, we saw two and three turtles respectively. It does look as if the turtle conservation work in the area over the last 20 - 30 years is having some effect.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were joined by Orlando for our afternoon dive on the house reef. The conditions there are still not great for diving as the vis is still poor and the current was stronger than yesterday. Orlando is an open water diver but was able to cope with the conditions and it was another reasonable dive if not as spectacular as this mornings. By the time we had got back, Bettina had completed her open water course so will be able to fun dive tomorrow.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th February</span>
            A very similar day to yesterday. Another couple of people on the boat today. We had everyone who was on it yesterday plus one snorkeler and one DSD. It is getting positively crowded! We were in a group of four with the Dutch couple who were on the boat yesterday, Dagmar and TJ, and had another new guide, Anto. The two sites today were Mandolin and Celuh Celuh. Both dives were very good again. Both dives were wall dives. We saw fourteen turtles on the first as well as three or four Napoleon wrasse. The topography of the second site was very spectacular although it did not have as many fish as some of the other sites here. We still saw another thirteen turtles including three hawksbills.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We dived the house reef on our own again after lunch. The vis does not seem to be getting better and navigation is still not that easy but the current had dropped since yesterday and we were able to do a dive of over 90 minutes without seeing too much of interest. Despite the poor vis we made it all the way back to the beach today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Slightly different evening to usual. Today is Chinese New Year's Day so some of the staff have been dressed in Chinese type outfits all day, there are decorations up and tonight we had a bar-b-q with entertainment of sorts. The entertainment involved the staff singing along to a few musical instruments while most of the guests tried to avoid getting roped into participation. All quite enjoyable but all over by about 8:30 so still an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 6th February</span>
            Another similar day. All the other divers from yesterday were either out on land based excursions or had left the resort so it was just the two of us on the boat again today. This meant that we could choose what we wanted to see so it was back to Bunaken for more turtles.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-213.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were diving with Anto again and went first to Kelapa Pandek which is slightly East of the Lekuan sites.  Not surprisingly, this was similar to the Lekuan sites with plenty of the schooling fishes and also plenty of turtles. We went down to about 38m at the start of the dive to look for sharks and I saw one black-tip. Roz saw a second and Anto reckoned he saw three. It was a more normal dive up the wall after that and Roz counted 29 turtles, all green.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive started at Lekuan II. There was quite strong currnet here so we got through the site and most of Lekuan I as well, almost ending up back at Kelapa Pandek. Roz counted another 39 turtles, another record outside of Borneo. This dive took her turtle count up to 810 for the trip so far. It is quite incredible the way that the number of turtles has increased at Bunaken. Eleven or twelve years ago we thought there were a lot of turtles around as we saw almost one turtle every dive. On this trip on average we are seeing almost 18 per dive. Admittedly, we are spending just about all the dives there looking for turtles whereas we saw more on the walls on previous visits but it is still a huge increase.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did our final dive on the house reef after lunch. Just about sorted out our navigation of the site now at the fifth attempt but the vis was still pretty poor and it was definitely not the best dive of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few beers with our meal this evening, our first alcohol for two weeks. The resort sells German wheat beer for about the same price as Bintang so we had a few of those while talking to the Dutch divers that are staying here. A relatively late night as we were not back to the room until about 10pm!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th February</span>
            We were checking out of Murex today but as the diving has been so good, we had decided to dive this morning before heading into Manado. The Dutch group and Orlando were back on the boat so we were diving with Dagmar and TJ again. The first dive was at Sachiko's Point on the Northern side of Bunaken. Another very nice site. The wall was not as steep as some here and there were not that many turtles but the vis was good, it was very fishy in places and we did see two or three hawksbills. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was back at Lekuan I and was as good as every other time we have dived here. Today Roz counted 38 turtles on this dive meaning we have seen well over 200 in six days here. It was an excellent dive to end our stay here. The diving here has been better than we were expecting particularly from the point of view of the turtles. However, it has not only been the turtles. The dive sites have been spectacular, the vis has been better than anywhere we went in The Philippines and there have been a lot of fish on just about every dive. We are already keen to come back here!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-214.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the dive centre we washed our equipment, had showers and packed the rest of our luggage before going for lunch. As we finished lunch a birthday cake was bought out for Roz and we had about five minutes of all of the resort staff singing Happy Birthday. As with Lembeh, the staff here have been superb.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we finally got away from lunch, we paid our bill, collected our various belongings together and got a taxi into Manado where we had booked the Four Points by Sheraton for two nights. We attempted to get a room upgrade at check-in, failed miserably but did get another free birthday cake.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were in our room by about 4:00 and went straight out to buy provisions for this evening. Indonesian cities are not generally great places to be for celebrating birthdays. There are very few bars and buying alcohol can be difficult. Manado was no exception. Our hotel is built on top of a shopping mall so we thought we would be able to buy rum or something similar from the supermarket. However, the alcohol section consisted of not much other than Bintang, the local beer. This was not a great option but we were directed to another mall about a mile away which apparently had a bigger selection. This supermarket was no better but we found another hypermarket round the corner which had a slightly better beer selection, a range of Indonesian alcopops and, after a trip to the customer services desk, a small bottle of vodka. We stocked up on a range of bottles and walked back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the room while Roz opened her presents and went out to eat at about 8. We walked to Raja Sate, a restaurant that had been recommended to us while we were in Lembeh. We had ordered food when we found out that they did not have any beer despite beer being on the menu. We left there and walked to Tuna House which was not far away and had also been recommended. This was a nicer restaurant anyway with nice sea views and it did have Bintang. We had a pretty good meal there before walking back to the hotel. We had planned to go for a drink in the hotel bar but it had just closed when we got back at 10:35. We sat there and drank one of our alcopops before returning to the room and drinking the vodka. Not too bad a night in the end!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 8th February</span>
            It rained heavily for most of the day again today. This did not really matter as there was nothing we needed to do that involved going further than the shopping mall beneath the hotel. We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel before going back to bed to catch up on sleep. We were not really hungover despite the combination of drinks yesterday but we had started drinking quite late and not got to bed until about 2am. We have also done a lot of diving in the last two weeks.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We walked round the mall a couple of times in the afternoon but spent most of the day in the room sorting out photos, etc. I made it to the gym in the evening and ran 5km in 29:47. Not my best run ever but the first one since October so not too bad. It had stopped raining by the time we went out to eat but there was still a lot of water around so we stayed in the shopping mall and ate at Pizza Hut. Back in the hotel by about 8:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 9th February</span>
            Did not do a lot all morning. The weather was better today so Roz was able to go to the pool after breakfast.  I stayed in the room and continued sorting out the photos from the last couple of days of diving.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We checked out of the hotel at about 11:15 and got a taxi to the airport. We were at the airport by midday and checked in for our flights to KL via Singapore. The first Silk Air flight was supposed to leave at 13:50 but was slightly late taking off. However, we made up the time and got to Singapore slightly early at 17:20. We had a couple of glasses of wine on the flight so the three hours passed quite quickly. The early arrival meant that we had plenty of time before our onward Singapore Airlines flight to KL at 18:50 and were able to buy duty free Bacardi to take with us. Singapore is the first place we have been since leaving home that has had proper duty free prices. Everywhere else, Malaysia in particular, the prices have been higher than we would expect to pay at home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second flight was on time and we landed back at KLIA at about 19:20. We got through the airport relatively quickly, caught the shuttle bus to KLIA2 and checked into the Tune Hotel for the third time since leaving home in October. We had a couple of drinks in the room before going out to eat at the Indian restaurant in the terminal and then returned to the room to follow the football. We drank slightly more of our Bacardi than we had planned to and got to bed around 2am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 10th February</span>
            We checked out of the hotel just after 10:00, walked back to KLIA2 for breakfast (roti canai in the NZ Curry House) and sat and waited for the bus to Butterworth.  We had booked tickets on-line for this about a week ago. The bus came in on time and left at 11:30. The bus was one of the better Malaysian buses with only three seats across so plenty of space for the six hour journey.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The bus was very comfortable up until about 4pm. A lot of people had got off at Ipoh and there were not many passengers left so at 4, we were all transferred to a minibus for the remainder of the journey. We were dropped at the ferry terminal in Butterworth just after 5:30 and got on the 5:50 ferry across to Georgetown on Penang. </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-215.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The ferry took about 20 minutes. We had a few minutes walk the other side and then got a taxi to The Bayview Hotel where we have a room booked for the next three nights. Georgetown is one of the few places we have stayed in on every one of our world trips and we have stayed at The Bayview on both of the last two. We have good good views of the sea on our previous visits. This time we have another very good view overlooking most of Georgetown and the bridges back to the mainland.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was getting on for 7pm by the time we had checked in. We had showers and went straight out to eat. Georgetown is a nice enough city to wander round but the highlight of staying here is probably the food, particularly in Little India. We first walked through China Town along Chulia Street. There were a few new places opened up but a lot of it was not too different from the last time we were here. There were still a lot of decorations up from Chinese New Year so it was all quite colourful. We got to just about the end of Chulia before turning left into Little India and along to Sri Ananda Bahwan, the Indian restaurant we have eaten in the last couple of times we have been here.  The restaurant had not changed at all and the food was excellent again. We walked back to the hotel after eating and had a somewhat earlier night than yesterday.
