            We checked out of the resort at about 9:30 and were transferred back to Cebu island. The public ferries only run on Tuesdays and Saturdays (something we did not know) so private transfer on the big dive boat was the only way we had of making the crossing. The crossing took about 45 minutes and at about 10:30, we were dropped on the beach at Argao.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were heading for Moalboal and had enquired about another transfer to get to the resort. We had been quoted PHP2,500, about Â£37, which seemed a lot for that distance so decided to try and do it by public transport instead. We were only a few metres from the main road when we got off the boat so stood there with our luggage until a bus came. We waited about 10 minutes and got a Cebu City bus for about 17 miles up the coast to Carcar. Here we waited another 10 minutes or so and got on another bus to Moalboal. Getting on and off the local buses with all our luggage is not that easy but the locals are fairly helpful and we got there without too many issues. At Moalboal, we got a motor tricycle taxi thing to take us to Quo Vardis Resort at Panagsama Beach, about three or four miles away. Total cost of journey PHP480. It took a bit longer than a private transfer would have done but was worth the effort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we arrived at the resort, we were told that the room we had booked was not available until Thursday. We booked the same room that we had stayed in previously as it was the best one in that price range. After we confirmed that we had booked Room 9, they upgraded us to one of their bungalows for three nights so we were not too bothered. The bungalow was being cleaned when we arrived so we checked in at the dive centre, booked ourselves on tomorrows dive trip and went for lunch. After getting into the room, we spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We stayed at Quo Vardis a couple of times the last time we traveled six years ago. At the time Moalboal was one of the best places we had visited but we had heard a lot of reports that it had become over developed and was no-where near as good as it once was. First impressions were that not too much had changed. The town of Moalboal itself has certainly seen some changes, there is now shopping mall and McDonalds there but this does not really  affect us. I had a quick walk around Panagsama in the evening and although there have been some changes in the last six years, there is nothing too different. The bars/restaurants that we always used to eat and drink in are still there as is the local J&J mini-market so we are quite happy with our decision to come back. Quo Vardis has not changed although the dive centre is no longer called Visaya Divers, it is all just part of the Quo Vardis Dive Resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were quite late going out to eat due to Roz watching Andy Murray's match in the Australian Open. We returned to Chili Bar which had not changed a lot although it was a bit busier than we remember it. We had very good pizzas again and were back in the room by 10.

            The schedule here is two dives in the morning and one in the afternoon. We did all three dives today. The first was at Pescador Island, a small island that we can see from our balcony about 15 minutes away by boat. We dived the West side of the island. There were a lot of boats there when we arrived but most must have been for snorkelers as there were not many other divers in the water. Despite Quo Vardis being full, there was only us and one other fun diver on the boat. We were led by Isma, a local guide and also had a Swedish DM in the water with us.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The dive was pretty good. Pescador was always the best diving when we stayed here before. It has steep walls and the vis today was as good as we have had sine getting to The Philippines. There were plenty of fish around and we also saw three frog-fish. We returned to the resort to drop off Wilfred who was only doing the one dive and then did the second dive at Talisay. This was another good wall dive that we have done before. The vis was not as good as we have had in the past but was good enough to let us see five turtles.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-192.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had the remains of last night's pizza for lunch back on the balcony for the third dive which was our first visit to the sardines. When we were here six years ago, there was a big school of sardines at Pescador. The sheer size of it made it was one of the most spectacular things we had ever seen underwater. Not long after we were here, the school moved from the island to just in front of Panagsama Beach. It has also grown in size and the current estimate is that it consists of 7 - 10 million sardines.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got in the water just North of the school and drifted South. There was a small school as we got in that we went past after a few minutes. After a few more minutes everything started going completely black as the school blocked out the light. When we had seen them at Pescador, it was in perfectly clear blue water. Here, the water was a lot murkier with no-where near as good vis but it was still an unbelievable sight. We spent 20 - 25 minutes swimming through the school before continuing along the wall looking at sleepy turtles. All in all, a very good day's diving. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks on the balcony while looking at the days photos before going out to eat. We had pizzas (again) at "The Last Filling Station", another of the places we ate at when we were here last time and returned to the balcony for a few more drinks.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 16th January</span>
            Three more boat dives today. We had another local guide today, Raymond. We had one other diver in our group for the first dive and an Australian couple with us on the third. The morning trip was to a couple of sites North of the resort - Kasay Wall and Tuble. Both were fairly similar sites with a steep wall. Enjoyable enough dives again although the vis is still not great. We had turtles on both the dives - four on the first and seven on the second.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-193.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort for lunch. We had decided last night that we would like to stay one night more here than we have booked before going back to Cebu City. However, we asked at reception and were told that they are fully booked and this is not possible. Another change of plan required.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been unsure about whether or not to do the third dive but they were doing the "Sardine Run" again so we decided we might as well. This was a very good dive again. The vis was slightly better than yesterday and the sardines were just as spectacular. We were attempting to get all the way back from the sardines to the resort but the current turned on us meaning we had to change direction and go back to the boat. We still got a 71 minute dive and saw another five turtles. (Roz's turtle count is still going and is now up to 583.)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we got back, we went to have a look at a couple of other places to stay for the night of 22nd. We booked a room which is cancelable but will have a look at other options... and hope that Quo Vardis gets a cancellation.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a very similar evening to yesterday but with slightly more rum.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 17th January</span>
            We did the two boat dives again in the morning. The first was a repeat of the dive at Pescador West that we did two days ago. We dived with the Australians from yesterday and were led by Raymond again. The dive was very similar to the first time we were here and we saw the same three frog-fish. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">It was just us and Raymond for the second dive at Tongo. This was an excellent dive with lots to see. We went into a cave where there must have been nine or ten small electric clams. We saw a ghost pipe fish,a pygmy sea-horse and the first little yellow box-fish we have seen in a while. We also saw another two turtles, one as soon as we got into the water and another huge green turtle that came out of a cave after we disturbed it from its sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, we moved our stuff over to Room 9, the room we had booked and the room we had stayed in the last two times we were here. The balcony is not quite as good as the one we have just moved from but it is a nicer room and the view from the balcony is better. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For our third dive, we dived on our own on the house reef. We did this a few times when we were here before. Being on our own, we are not restricted to the maximum dive time of 60 minutes. We went South into the current at the start of the dive and turned round on 40 minutes. It was an enjoyable 80 minute dive with three turtles including the first hawksbill we have seen here this year.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at Garden Cafe, a place we had not been to before, on the recommendation of someone at the dive centre. Very good pasta. After two nights of drinking too much, we were back in our room before 9 for an earlier, more sober night.
