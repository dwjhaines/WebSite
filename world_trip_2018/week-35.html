            We checked out of the resort at about 9:30 and were transferred back to Cebu island. The public ferries only run on Tuesdays and Saturdays (something we did not know) so private transfer on the big dive boat was the only way we had of making the crossing. The crossing took about 45 minutes and at about 10:30, we were dropped on the beach at Argao.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were heading for Moalboal and had enquired about another transfer to get to the resort. We had been quoted PHP2,500, about Â£37, which seemed a lot for that distance so decided to try and do it by public transport instead. We were only a few metres from the main road when we got off the boat so stood there with our luggage until a bus came. We waited about 10 minutes and got a Cebu City bus for about 17 miles up the coast to Carcar. Here we waited another 10 minutes or so and got on another bus to Moalboal. Getting on and off the local buses with all our luggage is not that easy but the locals are fairly helpful and we got there without too many issues. At Moalboal, we got a motor tricycle taxi thing to take us to Quo Vardis Resort at Panagsama Beach, about three or four miles away. Total cost of journey PHP480. It took a bit longer than a private transfer would have done but was worth the effort.

            <p class="diary-text">When we arrived at the resort, we were told that the room we had booked was not available until Thursday. We booked the same room that we had stayed in previously as it was the best one in that price range. After a bit of an argument, they upgraded us to one of their bungalows for three nights so we were not too bothered. The bungalow was being cleaned when we arrived so we checked in at the dive centre, booked ourselves on tomorrows dive trip and went for lunch. After getting into the room, we spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool

            <p class="diary-text">We stayed at Quo Vardis a couple of times the last time we traveled six years ago. At the time Moalboal was one of the best places we had visited but we had heard a lot of reports that it had become over developed and was no-where near as good as it once was. First impressions were that not too much had changed. The town of Moalboal itself has certainly seen some changes, there is now shopping mall and McDonalds there but this does not really  affect us. I had a quick walk around Panagsama in the evening and although there have been some changes in the last six years, there is nothing too different. The bars/restaurants that we always used to eat and drink in are still there as is the local J&J mini-market so we are quite happy with our decision to come back. Quo Vardis has not changed although the dive centre is no longer called Visaya Divers, it is all just part of the Quo Vardis Dive Resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were quite late going out to eat due to Roz watching Andy Murray's match in the Australian Open. We returned to Chili Bar which had not changed a lot although it was a bit busier than we remember it. We had very good pizzas again and were back in the room by 10.
