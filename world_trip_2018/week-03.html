                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 4th June</span>
                We were up earlier today, had breakfast and packed up all our stuff as we have to change rooms sometime today. We left everything in the room and headed out on our bikes again by 8:30. We headed East this time on the "Balatoni Körút" (Balaton Cycle Route). This route took us slightly further inland and it was a bit hillier than going the other way but all nice enough with occasional trips back down to the lake. It would have been very easy cycling despite the hills but either the temperatures are climbing every day or we are getting less fit as every uphill section was hard work. We got as far as Balatonszepezd before turning back, a round trip of just over 33 miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Arrived back at about 1:30 to find all our luggage had been moved to our new room, which is a bigger studio apartment and probably the nicest accommodation we have had so far on the trip . We ate the remains of last nights pizzas, booked somewhere to stay in Pécs for tomorrow night and spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around in the garden.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into Tihany to eat again in the evening. The place was very dead compared to what it had been like at the weekend. We managed to resist the temptation of another pizza and had a slightly more traditionally Hungarian meal before walking back to the apartment. Another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th June</span>
                I woke early today so cycled back into Balatonfüred to buy stuff for breakfast. We ate breakfast on the terrace outside the apartment, packed our stuff into the car and were on our way by about 9:30. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-017.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Our next stop was Pécs just over 100 miles away. It was another easy but slightly slow drive. We drove all round the Eastern end of the lake as far as Siofok before heading South through Kiliti, the village we had stayed at when we last visited Balaton 30 years ago. There was not much that we recognised! We had one stop for more provisions (Tesco again) and got to Pécs just after 1:00. We had a bit more trouble finding the apartment this time. We managed to find the road easily enough but the apartment was the wrong end of a one way bit leading to a bit of confusion and a slight detour. We were still checked into what is another very nice apartment by 1:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The apartment is about five times the size of the one we had in Sopron, is very new and about 10 minutes walk from the centre of Pécs. It is also very good value at about £30 for the night. We had lunch in the apartment and then out to see the sights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Spent about three hours wandering around the centre. While the other places we have been in Hungary so far have been small almost village type places, Pécs is much bigger with a strange combination of churches, mosques and a synagogue all connected by a series of spectacular baroque buildings. We walked up to the cathedral which was quite impressive and around parts of the old city walls which were not so interesting but gave good views of the cathedral. Other than that the sightseeing was just wandering round the different squares looking at all the buildings.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into the centre in the evening to eat. Neither of us were bothered about a big meal so we got kebabs from a place on the main square before walking back again. The area outside the apartment felt a lot more seedy as it was getting darker so we removed the bikes from the back of the car and bought them into the apartment building for the night. They were locked up and chained to the car but it still felt a safer option despite the additional hassle of bringing them in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 6th June</span>
            We were up by about 8, had breakfast, packed the car, reattached the bikes and were on our way by about 9:30. Our next destination, and the last place we will visit in Hungary is Villany a small village in one of the country's main wine producing areas.     
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got to the hotel by about 11:00. We are staying at the Crocus Gere Wine Hotel which is a Wine Spa & Resort. It was booked a while ago as a birthday present for Roz and includes a wine tour, a wine experiance and a six course dinner with wine...... and a 20 minute wine bath!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-018.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were given our room just after we arrived and then spent an hour or so at the pool or in the garden. The place has all the usual spa facilities - pool jacuzzi, steam rooms, etc and we seem to be the only ones using them so it was a very enjoyable couple of hours. We had lunch in the garden before starting on the wine.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went down to the restaurant for our welcome drink (Frici) at 3:00 before walking up to the Gere winery about 10 minutes away. The road up to the winery is lined with wine cellar type things (pincék), one from each of the winerys in the area. We stopped for one on the way and arrived for our tour at 4:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were the only English speakers there for the tour so we had our own guide. The first part of the tour we were sat in the restaurant area with our guide explaining about the history of the winery and all the usual stuff about the variety of grapes, etc. Not overly interesting but he kept giving us wine to taste so reasonably enjoyable. He then took us round the inside of the winery to the fermentation tanks and barrels which was better and we continued to sample the wines as we walked round.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tour lasted about 90 minutes and we stopped at another of the cellars on our way back to the hotel before getting ready for the next part of our package - the six course tasting menu. This was one of the best meals we have ever had. Every bit of it from the bread and pate at the start (course 0) was excellent and each of the courses came with accompanying wine.

            <p class="diary-text">The meal took about three hours so it was almost 10:00 by the time we had finished. We went out for a few more drinks after eating. All of the pincék had closed by this time but there was a bar across the road from the hotel that was still open so we stayed there until it closed as well.

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th June</span>
            We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and made it down to the pool by about midday. Spent the next three hours moving between the steam room, the pool, the jacuzzi and the garden, gererally making the most of the facilities.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            We had the final part of our package at 3:00 - the wine bath. This was a candlelit room with two baths filled with Dead Sea Salt which apparently "fills the body with minerals that are vital for strengthening the immune system, and also preserves the beauty of the skin." Added to each of the baths was a load of herbs and a large jug of red wine. We were then given a glass of wine each and were left to sit in the baths for 20 minutes. This turned into about 50 minutes. The place is still not very busy, and with only a few people using the spa, I think we could have stayed there as long as we wanted to. After 50 minutes we decided that the beauty of our skin was well enough preserved and it was time to go back to sitting in the sun!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of glasses of wine in the room while planning our route for tomorrow and went out at about 6:00. We had a drink in another pince before eating in the restaurant next door to our hotel. After saying that last nights meal was one of the best we have ever had, the food tonight was just as good. Another superb meal. We went to one more wine cellar and had a few more drinks in the same bar we had been in last night before returning to the room to watch the second half of England v Costa Rica.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 8th June</span>
            We had to check out of the hotel at 11:00. We spent about an hour using the facilities for the last time and continued our journey South just before midday. It has been a superb couple of days here and for a total of about £240, very good value. Hungary has been an excellent place to visit. When planning the trip, we had not expected it to be anywhere near as enjoyable as it has been. Everywhere we have stayed has been really nice, the people have been friendly and the food and wine cheap and very good. Quite sad to be leaving.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our next destination was Vrdnik in Serbia. We left Villany and drove about ten miles to the Croatia border where our passports were looked at for the first time since leaving home. We continued driving South until we joined up with the River Danube again. We drove along the river until we got to the Serbia/Croatia border.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been slightly concerned about getting through this border with a British car. There are plenty of horror stories on the internet about long delays and corrupt border officials demanding money for unnecessary insurance, etc. However, there was hardly any traffic on the road and we had our passports stamped and were on our way in a few minutes. All very straightforward. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued driving along the Danube and stopped for lunch on the way. We arrived in Vrdnik, just South of the Fruška Gora National Park just before 4:00 Finding the apartment was a bit more difficult than usual. Serbia is the first country we have visited where we have to pay to use mobile data so we no longer have internet access while we are driving. Road signs using the Cyrillic alphabet and the apartment having two completely different names for some reason did not help.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After two nights of luxury, it was back to budget accommodation again. We have a small apartment with no air-con for the next three nights. It does have  a large terrace that is shared by three apartments. We currently have this to ourselves as no-one else is staying here. Once we had checked in, we went off on our bikes for a look around Vrdnik and to go to the only cashpoint which is at the town's top hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we were back, neither of us felt like going out to eat. The amount of wine consumed over the last two days had taken its toll and we were both totally worn out. There were also thunderstorms around again and it was just starting to rain. We drove back into the centre of Vrdnik, picked up a take-away pizza and took it back to eat on the terrace.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 9th June</span>
            The weather was not great when we woke up (yesterday was a high of 35°c, today was 20°c) so spent the morning doing things like washing clothes and sorting the tent out - it was damp when we left Austria and this is the first place we have had a chance to get it properly dried out. We also booked a few things for the next couple of weeks including more Russian train tickets in case of the unlikely event of England winning their group. Tickets should be fully refundable so not too much of a risk in theory.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-021.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We finished last night's pizza for lunch and then drove to Novi Sad, Serbia's second biggest city, about 16 miles away. The main sight here is the citadel built overlooking the Danube. This in itself was not as impressive as had been suggested by the guide book but it was OK to wander round for half an hour or so and gave good views of the river and the city below. The town was also OK with some nice buildings  without anything being too spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the evening. The owner of the apartments (who seems slightly round the bend as do half the residents of Vrdnik), had bought us a couple of bottles of beer this morning. We drank them on the terrace as well as one of our remaining bottles of Tesco wine before going out to eat. We ate at a small restaurant that is about a 10 - 15 minute walk away although as the crow flies is only about 100m from the apartment and can be seen from our terrace. It was a fairly basic locals place with no-one able to speak English and no English menu. With the help of one of the customers who could speak some English, we were able to order Ćevapi (spicy meatball type things which are one of Serbia's national dishes), sausages and salad as well as carafes of the local wine. Once again it was an excellent and very enjoyable meal.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 10th June</span>
            A similar day to yesterday. Weather still not that good but better than yesterday. We did not do a lot in the morning but stayed in or around the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We spent a few hours in the afternoon sight-seeing. This area has a lot of monasteries dotted round the countryside We cycled to the two nearest ones, one in Vrdnik itself and one about three miles away in Jazak. Although not far, this was quite hard work due to the hilliness of the area. We were able to go inside the one at Vrdnik but at Jazak we were told that cycling shorts are not suitable attire for walking round monasteries so could only see it from the outside.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to the apartment for showers and lunch and then drove to a couple of the bigger more impressive monasteries at Novo Hopovo and Krušedol. These were too far away for cycling due to the hills. They were all nice enough although probably not as spectacular as some of the ones we are planning on visiting in Greece later in the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had the terrace to ourselves for the third day running so drove into the town and got another takeaway pizza before a relatively early night.
