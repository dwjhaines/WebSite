                We were up earlier today, had breakfast and packed up all our stuff as we have to change rooms sometime today. We left everything in the room and headed out on our bikes again by 8:30. We headed East this time on the "Balatoni Körút" (Balaton Cycle Route). This route took us slightly further inland and it was a bit hillier than going the other way but all nice enough with occasional trips back down to the lake. It would have been very easy cycling despite the hills but either the temperatures are climbing every day or we are getting less fit as every uphill section was hard work. We got as far as Balatonszepezd before turning back, a round trip of just over 33 miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Arrived back at about 1:30 to find all our luggage had been moved to our new room, which is a bigger studio apartment and probably the nicest accommodation we have had so far on the trip . We ate the remains of last nights pizzas, booked somewhere to stay in Pécs for tomorrow night and spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around in the garden.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into Tihany to eat again in the evening. The place was very dead compared to what it had been like at the weekend. We managed to resist the temptation of another pizza and had a slightly more traditionally Hungarian meal before walking back to the apartment. Another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th June</span>
                I woke early today so cycled back into Balatonfüred to buy sstuff for breakfast. We ate breakfast on the terrace outside the apartment, packed our stuff into the car and were on our way by about 9:30. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-017.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Our next stop was Pécs just over 100 miles away. It was another easy but slightly slow drive. We drove all round the Eastern end of the lake as far as Siofok before heading South through Kiliti, the village we had stayed at when we last visited Balaton 30 years ago. There was not much that we recognised! We had one stop for more provisions (Tesco again) and got to Pécs just after 1:00. We had a bit more trouble finding the apartment this time. We managed to find the road easily enough but the apartment was the wrong end of a one way bit leading to a bit of confusion and a slight detour. We were still checked into what is another very nice apartment by 1:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The apartment is about five times the size of the one we had in Sopron, is very new and about 10 minutes walk from the centre of Pécs. It is also very good value at about £30 for the night. We had lunch in the apartment and then out to see the sights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Spent about three hours wandering around the centre. While the other places we have been in Hungary so far have been small almost village type places, Pécs is much bigger with a strange combination of churches, mosques and a synagogue all connected by a series of spectacular baroque buildings. We walked up to the cathedral which was quite impressive and around parts of the old city walls which were not so interesting but gave good views of the cathedral. Other than that the sightseeing was just wandering round the different squares looking at all the buildings.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into the centre in the evening to eat. Neither of us were bothered about a big meal so we got kebabs from a place on the main square before walking back again. The area outside the apartment felt a lot more seedy as it was getting darker so we removed the bikes from the back of the car and bought them into the apartment building for the night. They were locked up and chained to the car but it still felt a safer option despite the additional hassle of bringing them in.
