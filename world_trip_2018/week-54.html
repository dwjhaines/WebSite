            Not surprisingly, we had a bit of a later start today. Neither of us were suffering that much from yesterday's cycling or the alcohol but we did not make it out on our bikes until about midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started off by cycling into Donauwörth again but instead of going into the town centre, we headed East along the Danube cycle route. It was not the most scenic part of the route and for most of the way, was away from the river but still nice enough. At Marxheim, we turned South again and kept going to Rain. Rain is another of the scenic little towns on "The Romantic Road". We stopped there for a rest and to take a few photos before completing the loop by cycling back to Asbach-Bäumenheim. We had decided that we would eat in again tonight so stopped at the supermarket on our way back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Although we had not been too bad when we set out, we were both totally worn out by the time we were back. We did less cycling today (31 miles) but on top of what we did yesterday it seemed harder work. Last night's alcohol probably did not help!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We did get our washing done in the hotel laundry room and cooked our evening meal again but that was about it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 28th May</span>
            The weather forecast for today and tomorrow had not been great and when we woke up it was, as predicted, cold, grey and damp looking. We went out on our bikes anyway at about 9:45 in light drizzle. We went West from where we are staying until we joined up with the Donauradweg again and continued West on that until we got to Höchstädt. Again the cycle route here was quite pleasant as opposed to dramatically spectacular.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-296.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">At Höchstädt we split up again as I was keen on doing another longer ride. Roz turned round and headed back to Asbach-Bäumenheim (a round trip of 35 miles) while I kept going on to Dillengen (another typically picturesque German city) before turning back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The weather up to this point had not been too bad. It had been a bit damp with some light rain but mostly dry and quite nice for cycling. However, as I was coming back through Höchstädt, it started raining heavily. I was still 20 miles or so from home so had no real choice but to keep going through it. I had about 45 minutes of cycling in it during which time I got totally soaked.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Despite the rain, I decided to continue on the Donauradweg all the way into Donauwörth before heading South back to Asbach-Bäumenheim. The rain did stop for the last ten miles or so but I was still soaked to the skin and covered in mud by the time I made it back to the apartment. Roz had stopped and sheltered from the rain and had not got as wet as I had. Still an enjoyable ride and another 53 miles without too much pain in the legs.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Again, we did not do too much after we got back. We went out to the supermarket to buy food for this evening stopping at the car-wash outside our hotel on the way. I was not bothered about cleaning the car but wanted to use the pressure washer to get all the mud off the bikes and thought we may as well do the car at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate in the apartment again and spent the evening editing photos and looking into places to stay for the last month of the trip. We have enjoyed staying here despite being slightly out of the way so have booked another three nights somewhere else in Bavaria (Landsberg am Lech) for when we return from Portugal. In bed by 10pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 29th May</span>
            We checked out of the hotel just after 10 and had a drive of about 90 minutes to get to the B&B Hotel on the outskirts of Munich. We are only staying here for one night tonight and again on Sunday. It is a budget hotel near an industrial estate but it has free parking and will let us leave the car here while we stay nearer the centre for three nights. We had parked on the road outside the hotel but they were quite happy for us to leave it in the car park at the back of the hotel which did seem more secure.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-297.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We could not check in until 14:00 so had a couple of hours to kill. The rain that had been forecast did not seem too bad today so we decided we may as well go out on our bikes for a couple of hours. Inevitably, as soon we decided this, it started raining but it was only a shower and by 12:20, we were on our way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The area we are staying is only about three or four miles South of the Alliance Arena so we went to have a look at that first. We were able to get a few photos from outside the ground but our attempts to get inside were very swiftly stopped. After cycling most of the way round the ground, we went back the other way and followed signs for the Marienplatz. This led us on cycle paths along the main road into the centre of Munich. We locked up our bikes and had a quick walk around but the sky was getting darker and we were keen on getting back to the hotel before the rain started again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We cycled back through the English Garden and although it did start raining, it was nothing like yesterday's and we were not too wet by the time we got back. We locked our bikes in the underground car-park, checked in and got the luggage from the car before eating lunch in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back into the centre of Munich at about 5:30. This time we got the U-Bahn to Marienplatz. We had a couple of beers in the Schneider Weisse wheat beer house and then walked down to the Augustiner beer hall near Karlsplatz. We ate in there and then walked back to Marienplatz and had a couple in zum Spöckmeier, the Paulaner beer hall, while watching the first half of the Europa League final. We got the U-Bahn back and watched most of the second half in the room before falling asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 30th May</span>
            We had breakfast in the room before checking out at 9ish. We left most of our luggage in the car, and took what we needed for the next three days with us on the bikes. It was a seven mile ride to the hotel near Donnersbergerbrücke S-Bahn station with a stop for photos at the old Olympic park on the way. We were at the hotel by 10:00 and after locking our bikes in the car park, were able to check in to our room straight away.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-298.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go to Andechs when Hoggy arrived but we got a message from him saying that he had not made the train he was hoping to get so after a bit of dithering, we arranged to meet him at the Viktualienmarkt at midday instead. It was a two mile walk for us to get there and we were there just before 12:00. Gary turned up unexpectedly just after we had got there and Hoggy arrived about ten minutes later. We had a couple of beers there before walking back to the Augustiner beer hall. From there we tried to go to the tap room at the Nürnburg sausage house but it was closed so went to the "big dog pub" for one instead. We stopped for one more at the Nürnburg sausage house beer garden which was open and then walked back to Hoggy's hotel to wait for Dave to arrive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once Dave had found the hotel, we all went to the Augustiner Kellar and spent a few hours sat in the beer garden. We left there at 8:30 and walked to the Augustiner Bräustuben but this is a bit of a vague memory! Regan eventually turned up just before 10 after we had eaten. Don't remember leaving at all but it was only a ten minute walk back to the hotel when we did eventually leave.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 31st May</span>
            We left the hotel at 11:00 and walked the four miles to the Hofbräukeller which is the other side of Munich to where we are staying. We had our first beer of the day in the beer garden there and were eventually joined by the others. We walked from there to Paulaner am Nockherberg, a new Paulaner beer hall and garden that we had not visited before. We quite liked the beer garden here, the beer was good and we liked the steins so we abandoned our plans to go elsewhere and stayed here for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into the centre via one other bar, stopped for one in the Viktualienmarkt beer garden and then returned to the Nurnburg sausage house. We had one beer stood up in the tap room and then got a table in the main restaurant where we got through 54 sausages between us. We had a final drink in the Hofbräuhaus before getting the S-Bahn back to Donnersbergerbrücke. Regan fell asleep on the tram, went back into the centre of Munich and got back to his hotel at about 1:45!
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st June</span>
            A very similar day to yesterday and the day before. We started with a four mile walk again, this time to the Chinesischen Turm in the English Garden. We met up with everyone else in the beer garden and stayed there for just over four hours. There was a lot of dithering about what to do next but eventually we decided to go by public transport (bus, U-bahn and S-bahn) back to the Augustiner Keller.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple more litres in there and then went to the Augustiner Bräustuben to eat - a slightly more sober meal than the one we had there two days ago! After eating, we got a tram and the S-bahn back to Marienplatz and returned to the same bar we were in three nights ago to watch the second half of the Champions League final. Dave had had enough by this time and went back to the hotel while the rest of us went for a final beer in the Hofbräuhaus. We got the S-bahn back to Donnersbergerbrücke when the Hofbräuhaus closed at midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd June</span>
            All the others left Munich today. Dave, Regan and Hoggy all flew home while Gary began his drive back to Calais. We have another couple of days here as we fly from Munich to Porto on Tuesday but today was a much needed break from beer. We stayed in the hotel until we had to check out at midday and then cycled back to the B&B Hotel where we had left the car on Thursday. We could not check in until 14:00 so left our luggage in the car and went out on our bikes again. We went back past the Olympic park and out to have a quick look round Schloss Nymphenburg which was all nice enough. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">From there, Roz went back to the Olympic park to lie in the sun for the afternoon, I cycled back to the hotel via the city centre and the English Garden by which time I was able to check in. We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. There are not too many options for eating in the area around our hotel and neither of us could be bothered to go back into Munich to eat so we had to make do with the McDonalds for our evening meal. We were back in the room before 7:30. The last few days have been excellent but we were both in need of an early night.
