            Four dives at Sipadan today. It was a slightly later start than from Kapalai. After a couple of slices of toast, we were on the jetty by 6:15 and had departed by 6:30. We were diving with Khai again and had Magnus in our group. Three other divers and one snorkeler on the boat.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-258.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first three dives today were excellent. The first was at South Point. Plenty of sharks, eight turtles and a big school of bump-head parrot fish in the shallows at the end. We did spend 10 minutes out in the blue, inevitably without seeing anything but this was to be the only time today that we did this so it was not too bad. The second dive was at Barracuda Point and this also featured a big school of fish, this time it was bat fish. We have never seen so many batfish in one school and spent 10 - 15 minutes watching them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was at Turtle Patch and was probably the best dive of the day. We dropped right on top of the big school of jacks and spent the first 15 minutes of the dive with them. This was more spectacular than the jacks the other day as there were more of them and we could get right into the middle of the school. The second half of the dive was the most turtley part of the day with Roz counting 16 in the last 20 minutes or so of the dive. Final dive of the day as at Drop Off. This was a good dive but was not as spectacular as the previous three. There were only six turtles but there was a final turtle sitting on Turtle Rock to end the dive which is always good to see!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at Mabul by 4ish and had another hour or so sorting out car stuff. Everything takes ages to do here as the internet connection is very slow but both our cars are now taxed and insured and we do not have to do anything else car related until we get home. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out after a couple of late nights and another four dives so we were back in the room fairly soon after eating tonight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 2nd April</span>
            Three more dives around Mabul today. We were led by Afat today, we think because his girlfriend was in our group. Also in the group was Mattias and his twin tanks although he only did the first two dives. We were the only four fun divers on the boat so in theory, we could choose where we wanted to dive today, but a lot of the guides when with a group of experienced divers seem keen on Second Wall, so we went back there again. I'm not really sure what the attraction of this place is apart from the fact that they don't dive it very often. Again, the dive was OK but not that great. We saw lots of nudis again and a couple of turtles, one that was huge.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-259.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive, Mattias was keen on Sea Ventures. Afat was happy to take us there but it is a stupid choice for a second dive after a one hour surface as there is nothing above 18m and we would have had anywhere near enough NDL time for a 60 minute dive. Roz complained and after a bit of discussion it was decided that we would do Nudi Nook again. This was a good dive particularly once we got back to Awas. We saw a couple of frog fish again and Afat found a juvenile brown banded bamboo shark, something we have not seen before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive after lunch was back to Awas. We dropped right into the area with the two frog fish and the bamboo shark so saw all of them again before moving to the rest of the site. As usual there, there was plenty to see. We saw another couple of frog fish, a few cuttle fish including the juvenile flambo, a tiny peacock razor wrasse and three more turtles. The dive was not was long as some we have done here as we were swimming into the current for most of it and both me and Afat got down to 50 bar but we still managed 72 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the evening. We had a couple on the balcony before eating. After dinner, we went up to the bar for a couple and then had a few more than planned on the balcony when we got back. GOt to bed at around 11:00.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 3rd April</span>
            Back diving with Khai today for three more Mabul dives. There were only three other divers on the boat, Magnus and Jonathon who were diving with us and another Khai who is a DMT. First dive was at Second Slope which is very close to Second Wall. This was a better dive than the previous two that we had done in this area. We saw another frog-fish and a banana nudibranch as well as plenty of other nudis.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-260.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at the Sea Ventures oil rig which is just off Mabul opposite the Scuba Junkie pier. We have dived here a few times before but not since 2013. We have never been that impressed with it as a site and have had some pretty crap dives here but today it was excellent. The area we dropped down to was unbelievable. There were two ghost pipe fish, a pair of clown frog-fish and the first tiny yellow box fish we have seen for a while. We could have spent the whole dive in that area alone. When we finally left there, we saw two more frog fish, one found by me and the other a tiny one found by Khai. We also saw a snake eel, ribbon eel, nudis, scorpion fish, etc. An excellent dive!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was back to Awas for the third dive. We did a different part of the dive site today starting further out in the channel between Mabul and Sea Ventures. Khai was still able to find a couple of tiny frog-fish and we saw our only turtle of the day so far. We decided that we may as well do another night dive here as the first one had been so good so it was back in the water just after 6. We did Awas again and once again it was an excellent dive. It was just me and Roz with Khai tonight. He continued his run of finding ridiculously small frog-fish with two more on this dive. We also saw one other bringing the days total to ten. Also saw five or six turtles, cuttle fish, stone fish, crabs, nudis, etc. A good end to a very good day's diving.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were late eating after the night dive. I only stayed in the restaurant until about 8:30 before returning to the room to sort out the cameras for tomorrow. Both asleep by about 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 4th April</span>
            Our final trip to Sipadan today. We were guided by Khai again and had Trevor in our group. Also on the boat were Aslam and Kim to guide the other four divers. It was another excellent days diving. We were slightly concerned about how good the diving would be today as the couple in the room next door to us had were very disappointed with the diving there yesterday. However, the conditions were good, the vis was better than we had seen on the previous two trips and all the dives were very good again.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-261.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at South Point again. We had the obligatory 10 - 15 minutes out in the blue before returning to the reef. Plenty of sharks around as usual here but not too many turtles as the tide was still high. When we did find turtles, we found a mating pair with another male trying to join in. We have seen turtles trying to mate before but have never had this good a view for so long previously.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did Barracuda Point for the second dive. Still no sign of the barracuda here but still a good dive. There were quite a few turtles around on this dive and at the end of the dive, we found the school of bump-heads in the shallows. Third dive at Drop Off was excellent. When we had been here three days ago, one of the other guides had found harlequin shrimps in Turtle Cave. We knew roughly where to look for them and Roz managed to find them again. Once we were out of the cave, turtles started appearing. We knew it was low tide and the best time of the day for turtle spotting but we saw more than we have ever seen on a single dive at Sipadan. Roz counted 62 including one hawksbill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our final dive at Sipadan was at Turtle Patch. We had gone looking for the jacks again and dropped in near them. Just as we were swimming towards them, Khai thought he had spotted the barracuda so we swam out towards them. As it was, there were only a few there but we kept swimming out into the blue to try and find hammerheads again. Inevitably we did not see any but there were at least plenty of fish around to look at. Once back on the reef, Roz and I went shallow fairly quickly while Khai and Trevor stayed further out. For us, the second half of the dive was very turtley again with Roz counting another 32 taking the total for the day to 118.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back just after 4pm. At about 5:30 we went for a walk round the island with a few of the staff and Trevor. This was mainly to buy ice-creams from Sipadan Water Village and then to watch the sunset from Reggae Bar. We got to the bar too late for the sunset so did not stop for a drink and returned to the resort for showers. After eating, we had a few beers in the bar with Khai while looking at the last few day's photos.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on our balcony finishing our Malaysian vodka when Dave came round to tell us that one of the turtle nest was hatching. We knew it was due to hatch in the next couple of days but were not expecting it to be tonight. This was a bit of bonus as we got to see another 93 baby green turtles being released into the sea. After all this excitement, we returned to the balcony to finish our drinks and got to bed sometime around 11.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 5th April</span>
            After our last trip to Sipadan yesterday, today was our final day of diving at Mabul before we start heading back towards home. It is always good to end any dive trip with a good day but although the diving was OK today, it was the worst days diving we have had since getting to Mabul.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Things started off badly. Although today was supposed to be Khai's day off, according to the board last night he was diving with us. By breakfast time, his name had been deleted and replaced with KJ. KJ was coming from Semporna which also meant that the departure time for our first dive was changed from 8:30 to 9:15. When we did leave for the first dive, there was one other very inexperienced guide and four other customers - Trevor, Sally and two other blokes who we never spoke to. There was also one other Scuba Junkie employee, Mel who was diving on his own. We were diving with Sally and being led by KJ.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-262.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was at Second Wall yet again which we were not overly pleased about. KJ had problems with his ears and could not get down so all six of us were led by a guide with less than 100 dives. The dive was OK, we saw two turtles and we did get the full hour despite the dive being deeper than it should have been and two of the group getting low on air. The second dive was at low tide which should have been ideal for seeing lots of turtles. AJ asked us where we wanted to go and we said anywhere with turtles and he suggested Panglima Reef. This was not a great choice. AJ could not go down again, there were hardly any turtles and the other guide didn't show us anything. Mel did point out a small frog-fish at the start of the dive but that was about it apart from some brief turtle sightings. The two others on the boat were annoying underwater and once again, not a great dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the second dive, we had showers and checked out of our room before having lunch. For the third dive Khai dived with us and led the two of us and Trevor. Once we had got away from the other two divers it was an enjoyable enough dive again without being great. We dived Paradise which is supposed to have a lot of frog-fish but did not find any. All nice enough but no the best of dives to finish on.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the pier, we washed our gear, said our good-byes to everyone and were straight onto the boat back to Semporna. Despite todays diving not being great, overall it has been superb here again. The diving at Mabul has been better than on previous visits and Sipadan has been excellent as always. It has been well worth coming back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at Semporna, we left our BCD's and wet-suits at Scuba Junkie as they have a good area for drying things and walked back to the Seafest. We had received an e-mail from the hotel at lunchtime telling us that our reservation had been canceled due to a lack of payment but they let us check in without any problems. We left our stuff in the room and went straight out to the supermarket for cold drinks. We had considered buying more Malaysian vodka for tonight but Giant had sold out which was probably for the best! We ate at the Indian restaurant near the hotel again and were back in the room before 9:00. Seventy six dives in the last 23 days had totally worn us both out so we were in bed just after 9:30.
