            Four dives at Sipadan today. It was a slightly later start than from Kapalai. After a couple of slices of toast, we were on the jetty by 6:15 and had departed by 6:30. We were diving with Khai again and had Magnus in our group. Three other divers and one snorkeler on the boat.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The first three dives today were excellent. The first was at South Point. Plenty of sharks, eight turtles and a big school of bump-head parrot fish in the shallows at the end. The second dive was at Barracuda Point and this also featured a big school of fish, this time it was bat fish. We have never seen so many batfish in one school and spent 10 - 15 minutes watching them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was at Turtle Patch and was probably the best dive of the day. We dropped right on top of the big school of jacks and spent the first 15 minutes of the dive with them. This was more spectacular than the jacks the other day as there were more of them and we got right into the middle of them. The second half of the dive was the most turtley part of the day with Roz counting 16 in the last 20 minutes or so of the dive. Final dive of the day as at Drop Off. This was a good dive but was not as spectacular as the previous three. There were only six turtles but there was a final turtle sitting on Turtle Rock to end the dive.
