            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 29th April</span>
            We were up at 6:00 and left the house by 7:00 to start the final leg of our trip. We had a pretty good journey down to Dover and even with a petrol/food stop, we were at the port by 9:45. We were booked onto a ferry to Calais at midday but when we turned up at the check-in counter, we were told we could get straight onto the 10:15 departure. We were in France by 12:45, French time and had another uneventful journey to Antwerp where we are staying for the next couple of nights. We were parked and checked into the hotel by about 3pm.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did not spend much time in the room before heading out. We were staying a couple of miles outside the centre and had read about a brewery that we wanted to visit which was another mile the other side of the centre. We walked out to the brewery stopping in a couple of bars on the way. When we did get to the brewery we found it was closed on a Monday but we found a bar "La Pipe D' Anvers" just round the corner from it. This was an excellent bar serving the local Seef and Tripel D'Anvers beers which were also very good. We had a few in there before walking back into the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Things start getting a bit vague from here but we stopped in one more bar on the way to the centre and then went for a couple at Den Angel in the main square. We were on our way home from there when we spotted Pelikaan, one of our favourite Antwerp bars from previous trips. We had a couple more in there before the barmaid decided (probably correctly) that we were going to struggle to find our way back to the hotel so called us a taxi. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th April</span>
            We were late getting up this morning and then spent a couple of hours sorting out a few things for later in the trip. We went out on our bikes at about 2pm. We cycled 11 miles to Lier another small but very picturesque town. We spent an hour or so wandering around the sights before getting a late lunch from Panos and eating it sat in the main square. We had planned to cycle from Lier to the brewery at Westmalle but after a few miles, we realised this was going to be too far for today so changed the plan and cycled back to Antwerp instead. We were back at the hotel at 6ish having cycled over 27 miles in total.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-270.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we got the tram into the centre of Antwerp. We got off the tram at Groenplaats and had a wander around the squares and the cathedral. After a lot of thinking about what to eat, we ended up getting a portion of chips before heading into a bar. We tried to find another bar that we had been in ten years ago but did not know the name of it or exactly where it was. We found somewhere that we liked the look of instead (Blauwmoezel) and had our first beer of the day in there. This bar was closing by the time we had finished our first drink so we moved to the one next door (Paters Vaetje) which turned out to be the one we had been looking for! This was still an excellent bar with a good beer list. We stayed in here until around midnight before getting the tram home again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tram journey took longer than it should have done due to getting the tram in the wrong direction and then having to get a bus back to Centraal Station. We got the tram in the correct direction from there, had a final "bolleke" in Singel, the bar by the tram stop and were back in the hotel by about 1am
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 1st May</span>
            We were late getting up again and did not really do anything until check-out at midday. We loaded up the car and walked to Bercham train station for breakfast. Today was a bank holiday in Belgium and there was not much open so it was back to Panos for the second time in under 24 hours.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the car and were on the motorway heading North again by 1pm. Again, the journey was uneventful and we arrived at our hotel in Aalsmeer before 3pm. We had booked this hotel as it is near Schipol and we are able to leave the car with them (or in a car park round the corner from them) while we go to Bonaire. After checking in to the hotel, we walked round to a supermarket and bought a couple of things that we want to take to Bonaire with us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had got back to the hotel, we went out on our bikes again. We did a 14 mile bike ride, mainly through parks until we got to the outskirts of Amsterdam. We could not be bothered to keep going into the centre as cycling through the parks was a lot more enjoyable than cycling on the roads. We were back at the hotel by about 6:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at a Greek restaurant near the hotel in the evening, our first proper meal since leaving home! We were back in the hotel by 9 for a slightly earlier and more sober evening than the previous two.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd May</span>
            We were awake by 7:30 and drove to the supermarket to get stuff for breakfast. We were told yesterday that we would need to drive our car round to the car park but the receptionist today told us just to leave the key and they would sort it all out. We checked out of the hotel at 9:30 having left everything that we do not need for Bonaire in the boot. We were driven to Schipol by the hotel's minibus and checked in for the 12:05 KLM flight to Bonaire.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had time for a couple of traditional t'Ij Zatte beers before boarding the plane which left just about on time. The flight was fairly full. We had a few bottles of wine and I did manage to get a couple of hours sleep before we arrived in Bonaire. At the airport, Roz waited for the luggage while I went and sorted out the hire car. We were driving out of the airport not long after 18:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a stop at Warehouse supermarket on our way to Sand Dollar where we will be staying for the next three weeks. There was no key for us when we arrived but the security guard phoned Ilsa, who is now managing the hotel side, and she appeared and sorted it out within about 10 minutes. We were booked into B4, a one-bedroom apartment that we have stayed in a couple of times before. Nothing appeared to have changed in the apartment since the last time we were here in 2017. We were both worn out by the time we got here due to a combination of the six hour time difference and the amount of alcohol we have consumed in the last few days. We did not feel like going out to eat so I drove to Captain Don's and picked up a couple of take-away pizzas which we ate on the balcony. We were both in bed by about 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd May</span>
            We were up quite early so had time to have breakfast, sort out our dive gear and be down at the dive centre just after it opened at 8:00. We have booked 18 days of unlimited diving over the next 21 days so if anyone is still reading this, the next three weeks are going to be very repetitive!
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-272.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We filled in all our paperwork and were given our weight belts and an assortment of tags and were in the water for our first dive by 8:45. The first dive was at Bari Reef, the house reef in front of the sand dollar resort. The first dive is supposed to be an orientation dive but this is our tenth visit to the island so we were able to just get on with the dive on our own. It was a good dive to start although the water is a bit colder than we are used to. The last few times we have been here, it has been in September and although the water is only one or two degrees colder, this makes a big difference on an eighty minute dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at The Cliff and the third at Something Special with a return to the apartment for left over pizza in between. All three dives were good with a good selection of all the usual stuff we see at Bonaire but not anywhere else, i.e. arrow crabs, tarpon, juvenile drum fish, trunk fish, sharp tail eels, French angel fish, etc. No turtles on any of the first three dives but Roz did manage to find a frog fish at Something Special.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Fourth dive of the day was at Bari Reef again. We usually do this dive in the evening as it is a good dive and it is convenient to finish the dive near the dive centre so we can wash and put away our gear. In the past, it has regularly involved spending time with "Turtle 1", a hawksbill turtle that has lived on the reef for years. A few years ago, she would turn up here at almost exactly 6pm and go to sleep in the same place every night. Last time we were here, her movements were less predictable but she was still around. Tonight there was no sign of her or any other turtle but it was still a reasonably good dive to end the day with. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had another evening of not going out to eat but cooked pasta which we ate on the balcony instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 4th May</span>
            An early start this morning. As well as seeing Turtle 1 returning to Bari Reef in the evenings, we had also been able to watch her as she woke up  and started heading South for the day. Again, this used to be very regular but only happened a few times on our last visit. We thought it was worth a go, however so were up at 5:15 and in the water just over 30 minutes later. This is a nice time to dive anyway as it is the time that the reef starts waking up and there is a lot of activity. Still no sign of Turtle 1 but we did see another hawksbill towards the end of the dive that must live somewhere nearby.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-273.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at 1000 Steps. This is always one of our favourite sites here. The reef is more spectacular here than the house reefs and you are almost guaranteed to see turtles. Not today! The reef was still good but despite spending a long time looking, no sign of the turtles. We had planned to do two dives here but had forgotten to take our water and biscuits with us so returned to Sand Dollar before doing a third dive at Buddy's Reef. This is the next site along from Bari and is always a nice dive with plenty of fish. Today was no exception.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the fourth dive we did Bari Reef again in the hope that we would see this morning's turtle heading in the opposite direction. No sign of the turtle but again, lots of fish especially hundreds of creole wrasse swimming along the reef in the sort of numbers we have not seen for a few years.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the end of the fourth dive we had been underwater for a minute short of six hours so were both worn out again. We got a take-away from a new kebab shop that had opened across the road and had another early night. Roz was asleep by 8:30 and I followed an hour later.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 5th May</span>
            We had planned to get up early this morning and head down South to dive the Hilma Hooker. This is Bonaire's best wreck dive and is beast dived at 7am before anyone else gets there. Last night we decided that we would not set an alarm but catch up on sleep instead. We were awake by about 7:30 so had a slightly more leisurely start to the day. We had breakfast on the balcony before heading down South by about 8:30. There were cars already parked at the wreck so we carried on going and dived at Salt Pier instead. 
            </p>          
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-274.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Salt Pier has always been one of our favourite sites has been further enhanced in the last couple of years by the arrival of many young green sea turtles in the shallows on the way out to the site. In the past we have seen at least ten there. Today, the vis was not so great in the shallows but we still saw five altogether. It was reassuring that they are still there after the lack of turtles in the last couple of days. The rest of the dive was very good as well with plenty of fish as always around the pier itself.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There is quite a lot of wind around at the moment meaning there is quite a bit of surge making entry and exit at dive sites a bit trickier than usual (and is also why the vis in the shallows is poor). For our second dive, we chose Margate Bay as it is a relatively easy entry point. The dive here was also very good with three more turtles, one hawksbill and two green. We drove back North and changed tanks at Delphins Resort before doing our third dive at Windsock. This is not one of the best dive sites here but is nice enough and in a convenient location when driving back from the Southern sites. It was another good dive with our first big school of blue tangs and we got to see sponge coral spawning which should not really be happening at this time of day!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had decided that four long dives in a day is getting too much for us particularly after everything we have done in the last month so called it a day at this point. We returned to Sand Dollar via The Warehouse and did not do a lot for the rest of the day apart from a walk over to the Dive Friends shop where Roz bought a new pair of hard-soled booties. We cooked pasta and ate on the balcony again in the evening and managed to stay awake slightly later than last night.
