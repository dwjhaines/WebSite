            We were up at 6:00 and left the house by 7:00 to start the final leg of our trip. We had a pretty good journey down to Dover and even with a petrol/food stop, we were at the port by 9:45. We were booked onto a ferry to Calais at midday but when we turned up at the check-in counter, we were told we could get straight onto the 10:15 departure. We were in France by 12:45, French time and had another uneventful journey to Antwerp where we are staying for the next couple of nights. We were parked and checked into the hotel by about 3pm.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did not spend much time in the room before heading out. We were staying a couple of miles outside the centre and had read about a brewery that we wanted to visit which was another mile the other side of the centre. We walked out to the brewery stopping in a couple of bars on the way. When we did get to the brewery we found it was closed on a Monday but we found a bar "La Pipe D' Anvers" just round the corner from it. This was an excellent bar serving the local Seef and Tripel D'Anvers beers which were also very good. We had a few in there before walking back into the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Things start getting a bit vague from here but we stopped in one more bar on the way to the centre and then went for a couple at Den Angel in the main square. We were on our way home from there when we spotted Pelikaan, one of our favourite Antwerp bars from previous trips. We had a couple more in there before the barmaid decided (probably correctly) that we were going to struggle to find our way back to the hotel so called us a taxi.

            We were late getting up this morning and then spent a couple of hours sorting out a few things for later in the trip. We went out on our bikes at about 2pm. We cycled 11 miles to Lier another small but very picturesque town. We spent an hour or so wandering around the sights before getting a late lunch from Panos and eating it sat in the main square. We had planned to cycle from Lier to the brewery at Westmalle but after a few miles, we realised this was going to be too far for today so changed the plan and cycled back to Antwerp instead. We were back at the hotel at 6ish having cycled over 27 miles in total.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we got the tram into the centre of Antwerp. We got off the tram at Groenplaats and had a wander around the squares and the cathedral. After a lot of thinking about what to eat, we ended up getting a portion of chips before heading into a bar. We tried to find another bar that we had been in ten years ago but did not know the name of it or exactly where it was. We found somewhere that we liked the look of instead (Blauwmoezel) and had our first beer of the day in there. This bar was closing by the time we had finished our first drink so we moved to the one next door (Paters Vaetje) which turned out to be the one we had been looking for! This was still an excellent bar with a good beer list. We stayed in here until around midnight before getting the tram home again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tram journey took longer than it should have done due to getting the tram in the wrong direction and then having to get a bus back to Centraal Station. We got the tram in the correct direction from there, had a final "bolleke" in Singel, the bar by the tram stop and were back in the hotel by about 1am
            </p>

            We were late getting up again and did not really do anything until check-out at midday. We loaded up the car and walked to Bercham train station for breakfast. Today was a bank holiday in Belgium and there was not much pen so it was back to Panos for the second time in under 24 hours.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the car and were on the motorway heading North again by 1pm. Again, the journey was uneventful and we arrived at our hotel in Aalsmeer. We had booked this hotel as it is near Schipol and we are able to leave the car with them (or in a car park round the corner from them) while we go to Bonaire. After checking in to the hotel, we walked round to a supermarket and bought a couple of things that we want to take to Bonaire with us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had got back to the hotel, we went out on our bikes again. We did a 14 mile bike ride, mainly through parks until we got to the outskirts of Amsterdam. We could not be bothered to keep going into the centre as cycling through the parks was a lot more enjoyable than cycling on the roads. We were back at the hotel by about 6:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at a Greek restaurant near the hotel in the evening, our first proper meal since leaving home! We were back in the hotel by 9 for a slightly earlier and more sober evening than the previous two.
