                We left Kingsclere at 7:40, slightly later than planned due to staying out later than expected last night. However, we had a much better journey to Dover than we had expected and were at the docks by 10:00. We were booked on the 12:05 ferry to Calais but, because we were early, managed to get onto the 11:10 instead. This left about 15 minutes late but we were still in France by about 14:00.
            </p>
            
            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove directly to Belgium and had our first stop at Adinkerke where we exchanged all our empty Belgium beer bottles for â‚¬27. From there, we decided to drive on the coast road along to De Haan where we had booked to stay for a couple of nights. After about 30 minutes, we were bored with the coast road so returned to the motorway which got us to De Haan by about 16:00.</p>
                <p class="diary-text">
                We found our hotel easily enough. The hotel appeared to be very much like some sort of care/retirement home as we seemed to be the youngest people around by about 30 years and the only ones that did not have a zimmer frame or wheel chair! We later found out that it is some sort of care/retirement home and the first two floors are totally taken up by elderly residents. However, we have a room on the third floor, the location is ideal and there is free parking so it will be fine for a couple of nights.</p>
                <p class="diary-text">After putting our stuff in the room, we headed straight out on our bikes. We cycled along the coast following the route of the coastal tram. We got as far as Blankenberge where we had our first beers of the trip. We had a couple in the the Belgium Pier Bar at the end of the pier which had excellent views looking back along the beach. We stopped for another at De Perse which was some sort of sports club but had a very good range of beers.

                <p class="diary-text">By the time we had cycled back, sorted out the bikes and had showers, it was getting on for 21:00. We wandered round the centre of De Haan, tried the local chips and then spent the rest of the evening in a couple more bars. We stayed in The Barrel for an hour or so and then, when the rain had stopped, went out to De Zeeduif, the best beer bar in De Haan. This was an excellent place with about 100 beers and was the first place today that sold St Bernadus. Got back to the hotel just after midnight.

                A later start today as we were both in need of catching up on sleep. We left the hotel at about midday and had breakfast near to where we had parked the car before heading out on our bikes again. We had planned to cycle along the coast again but it was very windy and the part of the coast that we cycled along yesterday was not that exciting so we went inland to Bruges instead. This was a fairly easy flat 15 miles each way ride, mainly along country roads with very little traffic.
                </p>
                <p class="diary-text">By 2:30, we had parked our bikes just off the main square. We wandered around the centre for a while and sat in the square eating lunch bought from a supermarket. We cycled back the same way we had gone and were back in De Haan by about 5:00. 
                </p>

                <p class="diary-text">Had a slightly quieter evening than last night. We returned to De Zeeduif for a meal and a few beers but were back in the room just after 9:00
