                We left Kingsclere at 7:40, slightly later than planned due to staying out later
                than expected last night. However, we had a much better journey to Dover than we
                had expected and were at the docks by 10:00. We were booked on the 12:05 ferry
                to Calais but, because we were early, managed to get onto the 11:10 instead.
                This left about 15 minutes late but we were still in France by about 14:00.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We drove directly to Belgium and had our first stop at Adinkerke where we
                exchanged all our empty Belgium beer bottles for €27. From there, we decided to
                drive on the coast road along to De Haan where we had booked to stay for a
                couple of nights. After about 30 minutes, we were bored with the coast road so
                returned to the motorway which got us to De Haan by about 16:00.</p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-003.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We found our hotel easily enough. The hotel appeared to be very much like some
                sort of care/retirement home as we seemed to be the youngest people around by
                about 30 years and the only ones that did not have a zimmer frame or wheel
                chair! We later found out that it is some sort of care/retirement home and the
                first two floors are totally taken up by elderly residents. However, we have a
                room on the third floor, the location is ideal and there is free parking so it
                will be fine for a couple of nights.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">After putting our stuff in the room, we headed straight
                out on our bikes. We cycled along the coast following the route of the coastal
                tram. We got as far as Blankenberge where we had our first beers of the trip. We
                had a couple in the the Belgium Pier Bar at the end of the pier which had
                excellent views looking back along the beach. We stopped for another at De Perse
                which was some sort of sports club but had a very good range of beers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we had cycled back, sorted out the bikes and
                had showers, it was getting on for 21:00. We wandered round the centre of De
                Haan, tried the local chips and then spent the rest of the evening in a couple
                more bars. We stayed in The Barrel for an hour or so and then, when the rain had
                stopped, went out to De Zeeduif, the best beer bar in De Haan. This was an
                excellent place with about 100 beers and was the first place today that sold St
                Bernadus. Got back to the hotel just after midnight.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 24th May</span>
                A later start today as we were both in need of catching up on sleep. We left the
                hotel at about midday and had breakfast sat on the steps where we had parked the
                car before heading out on our bikes again. We had planned to cycle along the
                coast again but it was very windy and the part of the coast that we cycled along
                yesterday was not that exciting so we went inland to Bruges instead. This was a
                fairly easy flat 15 miles each way ride, mainly along country roads with very
                little traffic.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By 2:30, we had parked our bikes just off the main square.
                We wandered around the centre for a while and sat in the square eating lunch
                bought from a supermarket. We cycled back the same way we had gone and were back
                in De Haan by about 5:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Had a slightly quieter evening than last night. We
                returned to De Zeeduif for a meal and a few beers but were back in the room just
                after 9:00
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 25th May</span>
                We were up just after 6:30 and within 15 minutes were on our way out of De Haan,
                heading for Southern Germany. We were not sure exactly where we were heading to.
                The plan was to camp at Kipfenberg, just South of Nürnberg but the weather
                forecast for this evening was thunder storms so we had also started looking at
                alternatives. Our tent is not up to thunderstorms!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Leaving at the time we did meant that we had to get round
                Brussels at the peak of the rush hour which was not ideal. Apart from that, it
                was a pretty uneventful journey. We had a couple of petrol stops, a supermarket
                stop and lunch at a particularly un-scenic German motorway picnic area. By about
                14:00, the forecast was still for rain and we were slightly behind schedule so
                booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express at Schwabach, just outside Nürnberg.
                This was free with my Holiday Inn points so a much better option than camping in
                the rain. The hotel was just off the motorway so easy to find and we were parked
                and checked in by about 4:30. Despite the journey being almost 10 hours it was
                not too bad a day and meant that we were just under 500 miles closer to where we
                are going.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had showers and went straight into Nürnberg. It was a
                five minute walk to the S-Bahn station from our hotel and a 10 - 15 minute
                journey into Nürnberg from there. We walked through the old town to the castle
                area and went for a few wheat beers in the Burgwächter bar. Nürnberg is one of
                my favourite German cities and this is one of my favourite bars anywhere so we
                were quite content in here for a couple of hours. We had a couple in Zum
                Albrecht Dürer Haus before starting to walk back towards the station stopping in
                Bratwurst Röslein for one on the way. We had planned to eat here but didn't seem
                to get round to eating. We had a final drink in a bar by the tower opposite the
                station and got the 11:41 train back to Schwabach. Only vaguely remember getting
                back to the hotel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 26th May</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at miday, put our stuff in the car and went for a
                walk around Schwabach. We had not seen any of it yesterday as we were staying
                near the station and had gone straight into Nürnberg when we arrived. It was a
                nice enough old town with a town hall and square, a bit like a smaller version
                of Nürnberg.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After 30 minutes or so wandering round taking photos, we
                returned to the car via a supermarket and continued our journey South to
                Kipfenberg. We only had 40 - 50 miles to go so this took less than an hour. By
                2:20, we were parked outside the campsite where we last stayed during the 2006
                World Cup. Reception opened at 2:45 and after checking in, we were able to pitch
                our tent in almost exactly the same spot we had stayed previously.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It took us over an hour to put the tent up. It should not
                have been so complicated but we have only used it once in the last twelve years
                and there were no sign of the instructions. We were not helped by the fact that
                the ground seems to be full of stones so getting tent pegs in was just about
                impossible. However, by 16:00, it was just about up and should be OK as long as
                the weather holds for the next few days. Then spent about an hour trying to find
                my laptop charger which appears to have been left in Schwabach and another hour
                trying to work out how to get a replacement.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we wandered into the centre of Kipfenberg,
                hoping to find somewhere to watch the Champions League final. When we were here
                last time, every bar and restaurant had a TV and was showing the world cup. Now,
                none of them had so we thought we would not be able to watch it. We had a couple
                of beers in the square and returned to the pizza restaurant round the corner
                from the camp site. We thought that their tele had also been removed but after
                we had ordered, we heard commentary from another room and were able to move to
                see the game. By the second half, the restaurant had closed and it was just me,
                Roz and the owner/chef watching the game but it was an enjoyable enough evening.
                Returned to the camp site as soon as the game finished.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 27th May</span>
                I was awake by about 6:30 and straight away found my missing charger. It was on
                the front seat of the car. How it got there or how we did not find it yesterday
                I do not know but it was a good start to the day!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had breakfast outside the tent and then headed off on
                our bikes again. We were cycling along the Altmühltalradweg, a 100 mile cycle
                path that goes through Kipfenberg. We did about 16 miles of it to Eichstatt and
                back. The ride was slightly more hilly than cycling around Belgium had been but
                was not too difficult and a lot more scenic. It ended up being a round trip of
                about 36 miles which we completed in just over four hours including a wander
                round Eichstatt. This was a more successful ride than when we tried the same
                route twelve years and Roz had to be collected with the car with 10 km to go!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not do a lot for the rest of the day apart from
                laze around by the tent. I did cycle up to the castle to see what the views were
                like but that was all a bit of a waste of time. You could not get to the views
                without paying to go into the castle so I did not bother.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at the camp site restaurant in the evening, went for another walk around Kipfenberg and were back at the tent by 21:00 for a relatively early night.
            </p>
