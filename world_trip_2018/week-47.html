            A very quiet day today. Neither of us had been feeling 100% yesterday evening and getting drunk was probably not the most sensible idea. Thailand gets very hot in April and carrying our luggage from the airport in the hottest part of the day was probably to blame. We both seemed to be suffering from being in the sun for too long. Today we were not that ill but felt totally incapable of doing anything apart from sleep. We went to breakfast at 9:30 although that was mainly to fill up our water bottles and then went back to bed. We finally made it to the pool for an hour or so at 3pm but that was about it for today.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Neither of us had managed to eat anything all day apart from a couple of slices of toast at breakfast but by 6ish, I was finally starting to feel hungry. I did not fancy Thai food again so we went across the road to Lee Pizzeria where we had a couple of pizzas on the beach while watching the end of the sunset. Back in the room by 7:30
