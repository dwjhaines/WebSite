            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 8th April</span>
            A very quiet day today. Neither of us had been feeling 100% yesterday evening and getting drunk was probably not the most sensible idea. Thailand gets very hot in April and carrying our luggage from the airport in the hottest part of the day was probably partly to blame and we both seemed to be suffering from being in the sun for too long. Today we were not that ill but felt totally incapable of doing anything apart from sleep. We went to breakfast at 9:30 although that was mainly to fill up our water bottles and then went back to bed. We finally made it to the pool for an hour or so at 3pm but that was about it for today.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Neither of us had managed to eat anything all day apart from a couple of slices of toast at breakfast but by 6ish, I was finally starting to feel hungry. I did not fancy Thai food again so we went across the road to Lee Pizzeria where we had a couple of very good pizzas on the beach while watching the end of the sunset. Back in the room by 7:30 and I was asleep again not long after 8:00. 
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 9th April</span>
            I woke up just after 6:00 having slept solidly for almost ten hours. We both felt just about completely recovered although we did not do too much more today than we did yesterday. We were able to eat a proper breakfast today and then spent most of the day reading by the pool. We had considered doing a days diving while in Nai Yang but decided today that we would not bother and would just have a couple of days of relaxing before starting the journey home instead. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">As we were both feeling better, we were able to drink again tonight. We had a few on the balcony and were about to go out to eat when it started raining heavily. We had another drink while waiting for it to stop and then had to find a new restaurant to eat at. Sunset Point closed for one month from today as it is low season. Although the food used to be very good there, it has been a bit variable this year so this was not the end of the world. We had planned to find somewhere else on the beach but due to the rain, we went to a restaurant on "Walking Street" as it had tables under cover. Had a very good meal and then returned to the room to finish our Sang Som.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 10th April</span>
            Another day of not doing a lot. Spent the day either reading by the pool or editing diving photos in the room. We had planned on a quiet evening but ended up having a similar night to yesterday and drinking just as much.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 11th April</span>
            We stayed either in the room or by the pool until we checked out at 1pm. We left our luggage in reception and sat by the pool for another half an hour or so before our transfer to the airport just before 2 (we had decided that this time, walking was not a good idea!). The airport was a lot less busy than it can be and by 2:15, we had checked in and got through immigration giving us almost two hours to wait for the 16:00 Air Asia flight to Hong Kong. We left on time and it was an uneventful three and a half hour flight. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We landed in Hong Kong at 20:30 local time. We got through the airport relatively quickly and were able to get the 21:30 bus to North Point. The bus journey was just under an hour and we were dropped right outside The Harbour Plaza, North Point on Hong Kong Island where we had a room booked for three nights. We put our luggage in the room and went straight out to get something to eat. McDonalds was about the first thing we came to a few minutes walk from the hotel and we were hungry so we ate there before walking back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 12th April</span>
            We had planned to get up early and head out to visit The Big Buddha statue today. However, when we woke, it was grey and drizzly outside which did not make the trip very appealing. It also meant that most of the sight-seeing in Hong Kong was equally unappealing so we were a bit unsure about what to do for the day. We made it out of the hotel by about midday and got the MTR to Wan Chai.   
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had decided that we should try some of the food in Hong Kong other than McDonalds and the best place to try fish balls in curry sauce was apparently in Wan Chai. When we found the address of the recommended restaurant, the building was totally boarded up with no sign of any restaurant. The fish balls are supposedly ubiquitous in Hong Kong but we sent ages trying to find somewhere else serving them before eventually resorting to buying a portion from a Circle K. Slightly disappointing.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-266.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The next culinary stop on our list was Mak's Noodles. We got the tram from Wan Chai to Central and were pleased to find that the restaurant still existed and was open. We are not great fans of Chinese food but the restaurant was a bit more upmarket than we were expecting and the signature wanton noodle soup here was very good. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The restaurant was very close to the mid-level escalators so, after eating, we got a free ride up a few blocks and then walked along to the Mo Man temple complex. This was a group of three temples, of which one was actually quite interesting to look around while the other two were pretty unexciting. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was not too much else we wanted to see on Hong Kong Island and it was still too wet for just wandering around so when we left the temple we walked back to the tram line and caught the tram back in the direction of the hotel. As we went back through Wan Chai, I spotted "Hoppy Junction" which looked like a good craft beer pub. We got off the tram and the pub did look very good but despite it being in happy hour, the beer was still over £6 a pint. After a quick look on the internet we found another reasonable looking bar, The Hop House, about 10 minutes walk away. This also had a good range of beers including Erdinger at just over £4 in their happy hour (3pm - 9pm) and a range of decent Belgian beers, including Kwak for a a similar price. This was far more reasonable so we stayed in there for a few hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had seen a supermarket near the bar that although not a Tesco, seemed to have a lot of Tesco products in it. After making the most of the happy hour, we bought bread, chorizo, Cheddar cheese and a couple of bottles of white wine and returned to the hotel. We had a couple of glasses of wine (our first wine since Christmas Day!) with our food before going to bed.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 13th April</span>
            We had arranged to meet up with Nicole again this morning and left the hotel at 9:15. We got the MTR into Central and she eventually turned up with a hangover at about 10:30! The only sight we were still keen on was The Peak for the views of Hong Kong. We all got into a taxi and for the short journey to the top. It only took about five minutes in the taxi but from about halfway up, it became obvious that this was not a great idea. Although not actually raining today, it was very grey and overcast and we were heading into low cloud. By the time we were at the top, we were completely in the cloud and could see nothing at all. After a few minutes of photographing the fine views, we caught the tram back down the hill again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">From the station at the bottom of the hill, we walked through Hong Kong Park to one of the shopping centres at Admiralty and up to Nicole's favourite dim sum restaurant. We had never really tried dim sum before and but it was all quite enjoyable. It was a huge place and was totally packed. The food was all good, the whole thing was quite an experience and for just under HK$400, not too badly priced.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we had finished eating, Nicole's hangover was getting worse so we canceled the planned afternoon of sight-seeing. It was also raining heavily by now so not ideal for walking round. Nicole went back home to get a few hours sleep and we got the tram back to our hotel.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-267.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After a couple of hours in the hotel, the rain had stopped so we headed out again. We got the MRT back to Wan Chai and walked down to the waterfront. We had thought about getting the ferry across to Kowloon but you could hardly see Kowloon so we decided not to bother. We walked along the waterfront in the direction of Central until we met up with Nicole again. We continued walking to Central and this time we did get the ferry across. From Kowloon, you could see the buildings on Hong Kong Island, although the tops of the tallest buildings were still in clouds. We ate in a Chinese restaurant in the shopping centre near the ferry terminal. As we were queuing to get in, I would much rather have been back in The Hop House. We are never going to be that enthusiastic about Chinese food but the food was good and it was an enjoyable meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we walked along the waterfront again, this time looking at the views of the island. We got the ferry back over again, said our goodbyes to Nicole and got the MRT back to Quarry Bay. We bought a couple more bottles of wine and returned to the room just in time to follow the football which started at 10pm. We stayed up until after the football had finished (QPR 4 - Swansea 0, Sunderland 4 - Coventry 5) and got to bed at about 12:30. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 14th April</span>
            We stayed in the room until check-out at 1pm. We left our luggage in reception and went out for a bit more sight-seeing but once again, our plans had to be changed because of the weather. While the last couple of days have been cloudy and drizzly, by the time we went out today, it was raining. It was not too heavy but heavy enough to make walking around unpleasant. We got the tram to Wan Chai again but after a few minutes of walking around, headed into the nearest McDonalds for breakfast/lunch. By the time we left there, it was raining more heavily and we completely abandoned our plans. Instead, we got back on a tram and stayed on it until we were close to the Western end of the line.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-268.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We got off and had a quick walk around the shops before getting another tram all the way back to North Point. The tram journeys are an excellent way of sight-seeing particularly if you get on an empty one so that you get the upstairs front seats. They go through all the main areas of Hong Kong Island and give you an excellent view of everything as they slowly make their way through the streets. At about 25p per journey it is also very good value and more enjoyable than walking around in the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At North Point, we got our fourth tram of the day back to the hotel, sorted out our luggage and walked out to wait for the A12 bus to the airport We got on the bus at about 5:30 and the journey took just under an hour. We had an hour to wait until the BA check-in desk opened at 7:30, but were quickly through immigration about 30 minutes later. We still had about HK$420 in cash left so found a bar that sold 2 litre "Growlers" of Moonzen Jade Emperor Hong Kong Pale Ale at 7%. This nicely filled the time until we had to board the 23:10 plane for LHR. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The flight was pretty good. BA are a lot more generous with their wine than Malaysian Airlines and we got through quite a few bottles before falling asleep. 
            </p>
