            We had considered cycling to Heidelberg this morning before checking out but instead decided to get the driving over with instead. We checked out by about 9:00. Roz went to buy bread for breakfast while I put the bikes back on the car and we were on the motorway heading North again by about 9:30. We had one stop just outside Mannheim to eat breakfast and to put in petrol but it was an uneventful 300km journey to the village of Vijlen, just inside the Dutch border near Aachen. We arrived at our hotel in the centre of the village by about 1:00 and were able to check into our room straight away.

            <p class="diary-text">We were keen to go out on our bikes again despite the now cold weather and the threat of rain. Roz had thought it would be good to do a cycle ride through three countries - we are staying in The Netherlands but are  very close to the borders with both Germany and Belgium. I thought a better idea would be a ride that involved a beer in each of the countries.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed off to Aachen just across the German border about seven miles away. We had to shelter from the rain briefly on the way but it was mostly dry. We have been to Aachen a few times before and returned to Zum Goldenen Einhorn, a bar we spent a lot of time in the last time we were here in 2010. We had a wheat beer in there by which time the weather had improved. We continued cycling to Vaals, back the other side of the Dutch border. We found another nice bar there and both tried the Brand Imperator. When we came out of there, it was raining heavily and we decided to head directly back to Vijlen, missing out on the trip to Belgium. The timing of this was a bit unfortunate as by the time we were back in Vijlen, it had cleared up and it was quite a nice evening. However, we were both cold and wet by this time so locked up the bikes and returned to the hotel for showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we went out for a walk around the village but did not see any options for eating that were any better than the place we were staying. Restaurants here seem a bit expensive compared to what we have been used to but the best value was the three course menu for â‚¬24. The food was excellent and we accompanied it with a few bottles of La Trappe Trippel. The Netherlands is not as famous as Belgium for its beer but a lot of it, La Trappe in particular, is just as good. A very enjoyable meal.
