            We had considered cycling to Heidelberg this morning before checking out but instead decided to leave Mannheim and get the driving over with earlier. We checked out by about 9:00. Roz went to buy bread for breakfast while I put the bikes back on the car and we were on the motorway heading North again by about 9:30. We had one stop just outside Mannheim to eat breakfast and to put in petrol but it was an uneventful 300km journey to the village of Vijlen, just inside the Dutch border near Aachen. We arrived at our hotel in the centre of the village by about 1:00 and were able to check into our room straight away.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-112.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were keen to go out on our bikes again despite the now cold weather and the threat of rain. Roz had thought it would be good to do a cycle ride through three countries - we are staying in The Netherlands but are  very close to the borders with both Germany and Belgium. I thought a better idea would be a ride that involved a beer in each of the countries.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed off to Aachen just across the German border about seven miles away. We had to shelter from the rain briefly on the way but it was mostly dry. We have been to Aachen a few times before and returned to Zum Goldenen Einhorn, a bar we spent a lot of time in the last time we were here in 2010. We had a wheat beer in there by which time the weather had improved. We continued cycling to Vaals, back the other side of the Dutch border. We found another nice bar there and both tried the Brand Imperator. When we came out of there, it was raining heavily and we decided to head directly back to Vijlen, missing out on the trip to Belgium. The timing of this was a bit unfortunate as by the time we were back in Vijlen, it had cleared up and it was quite a nice evening. However, we were both cold and wet by this time so locked up the bikes and returned to the hotel for showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we went out for a walk around the village but did not see any options for eating that were any better than the place we were staying. Restaurants here seem a bit expensive compared to what we have been used to but the best value was the three course menu for â‚¬24. The food was excellent and we accompanied it with a few bottles of La Trappe Trippel. The Netherlands is not as famous as Belgium for its beer but a lot of it, La Trappe in particular, is just as good. A very enjoyable meal.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th September</span>
            The weather was a lot better this morning so, after breakfast, we checked out of the hotel, left the car in the car park and went out on our bikes for a few hours. We found a 28 mile circular cycle route from the internet that went through Vijlen.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-113.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The route started by going to the point where the three countries meet so we were able to stand in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany at the same time. This is also the highest point in The Netherlands at a massive 322m above sea level. The route then took us back through villages either side of the Dutch/Belgium border. It was surprising hilly given the two countries we were cycling in but was quite scenic and another enjoyable ride. Roz cut the corner off at the end, shortening her ride by seven miles while I carried on and completed the full circuit.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were both back at the car at roughly the same time and departed for Ghent, our final stop on this leg of the trip, at about 14:00. The 200km journey took about two hours and we were outside the Parkhotel by 16:00. It took another half hour to find the car park which was 500m away, park and check in. As usual with Belgian underground car parks, this one seemed to have been built for cars about half the size of mine.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 6ish. We have been to Ghent a few times as it is one of the best places in Belgium or anywhere else in the world for drinking beer. We went round a few of our favourite bars - 't Galgenhuis, Het Waterhuis aan de Bierkant, 't Dreupelkot (jenever bar), Dulle Griet, Trollekelder and finally Trappistenhuis which is just round the corner from our hotel. The last pub is a bit of a vague memory!

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th September</span>
            A quiet morning spent recovering from last night's beer. We wandered into town for a walk around the sights at midday. We spent an hour or so walking round the various squares and then another hour or so walking round a few supermarkets buying beer and chocolate to take home.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We started on the beer again at 4:00. We started off at the Trappistenhuis today as neither of us remember it too clearly from last night! We had planed to go to the Gruut Brewery next but it had closed down since we were last here (although their beer is still available all over Ghent). We walked instead to Het Waterhuis for a few, stopped next door for a jenever and finished off back at the Trollekelder. This is probably my favourite pub anywhere so was the ideal place to have our final beers for this part of the trip
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Got back to the hotel just before 11:00.
            </p>

            We left the hotel at about 8:30 and started driving towards Calais. We had a few problems getting out of Ghent due to a motorway entrance being closed and ended up on a slightly longer route than planned. We had a couple of stops on the way - Adinkerke for tobacco and more chocolate and Franglais Vins in Calais for wine - and got to the port at 11:40 in time for the 12:40 ferry back to Dover.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The ferry was a few minutes late leaving but by 1:30, we were back in Dover. It took ages to get through the port as half the lanes were closed and at least two ferries had arrived at the same time. We had a stop at Folkestone Tesco to get lunch but other than that, it was an uneventful journey back to Kingsclere. Got back to the house by 4:30. Total mileage for the trip 4989.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 28th September</span>
            The start of three weeks at home before the next part of our trip. Spent most of the morning sorting out our luggage, putting things in the loft, etc. Left Kingsclere to drive to Sheffield at 11:30. One of the worst journeys of the trip so far! Got to Sheffield just after 5:00 for the start of Hoggy's 50th birthday celebrations. Hoggy, Roz and I got a taxi into Sheffield where we met Sarah, Gary, Ed, Jim and Dave. Spent the evening in The Bath Hotel, Fagins and Butler's Balti House.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th September</span>
            Today was supposed to be spent traveling round the Peak District by train but due to a rail strike, this got changed to a pub crawl into Sheffield by bus. We had an hours walk to the first pub and then spent a few hours getting on and off the bus stopping at more pubs. Ended up in Heely. More pubs before moving on to Kelham Island by bus and tram. A few more pubs in Kelham Island (15 for the day) and taxis home.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th September</span>
            Drove back South to Nottingham. Visited Aunty Jean and stayed at the Nottingham Knight Travel Inn.
