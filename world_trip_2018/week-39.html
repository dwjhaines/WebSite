            Having been to Penang so many times before, there was not really any sight-seeing that we wanted to do. We spent the morning in the hotel, either by the pool (Roz) or in the room finishing off the photo editing (me). We went out at midday as we had a few things we wanted to buy while we had access to proper shops again. We walked to a dive shop as there are a few things we could do with buying but it was not a big shop and did not have anything there we wanted.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from there to the Komtar tower which has a big shopping centre beneath it. We found a money changer and were able to buy the US$ that we need for our Burmese visas for our live-aboard later this month. Malaysia is a good place to change money as we do not have to pay to use the ATM's and the money changers give very good rates of exchange. We looked at options for SIM cards and bought a few things from the supermarket including provisions for tonight.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-216.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to Lebuh Chulia and then had lunch in another Indian restaurant that we have eaten at several times. Roz went back to the hotel while I returned to Komtar and bought a SIM card so we could make phone calls home again. I got back to the hotel by about 3:30 and we spent an hour or so by the pool. The weather here is much better than it has been the last few weeks and it stays light later into the evening than it did in The Philippines and Indonesia. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks sat in the room before going out to eat. We went out to Sri Ananda Bahwan again and had another excellent meal. The food here is as good as anywhere we have eaten since leaving home in October. We stopped for a couple of beers in a bar just off Labuh Chulia on the way back to the hotel and continued to drink our Bacardi when we got back. Got to bed sometime around 1am.

            Did not do much today. We were not too hungover but did not have anything we needed to do or that we wanted to see. We only really left the hotel for meals and a quick visit to the Chocolate Museum (disappointingly small amount of free samples for tasting). We went to our usual restaurant for lunch and then back to Sri Ananda Bahwan in the evening for another excellent curry. 
            </p>

            We had a flight booked to Phuket for 9:25pm today. This was not an ideal time but the flight was very cheap. We had planned to make the journey overland stopping at Koh Lanta on the way but the flight was probably cheaper and is certainly a lot less hassle. We had one trip out of the hotel in the morning - Roz to buy a birthday present for someone and me to get my hair cut. Apart from that, we stayed in the room until we had to check out at 1.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When we did check out, we left our luggage at the hotel and walked out to the post office at the Komtar and posted Roz's present. We also managed to buy more amoxicillin to replace the ones that we had used in The Philippines (10 x 500mg for RM5). We stopped for lunch on the way back to the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool. I did go out for another walk to look at second-hand books but it was too hot to go far.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got a taxi to the airport at 7ish. The journey was about 30 minutes. Check in was very quick for an Air Asia flight and by 7:45 we were sat in McDonalds having the first food that did not involve curry since Saturday morning. While at the airport, we discovered that Annette had given birth to twins.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The flight left on time at 21:25 and we landed in Phuket an hour later, also at 21:25 local time. There were long queues at immigration but they moved fairly quickly and it did not take long to get through. We were lucky to have just got in ahead of a flight from Dubai!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We have had problems in the past with taxi drivers at Phuket airport as they ask ridiculous sums of money for the 1.5 mile journey to Nai Yang. We have got round this before by walking out of the airport and getting a local taxi for a more reasonable price. Tonight there were not many taxis about and those that were there still wanted too much so we ended up walking all the way. We arrived at the Nai Yang Beach Resort by about 22:30. Check in was surprisingly quick although as on just about every other time we have stayed here, we were in a different room to the one we had booked.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Despite it being late, we felt like a couple of drinks. I walked to the minimart next to the hotel and spent the money we had saved on the taxi on beer and diet coke. We finished the end of the duty free Bacardi we had bought from Indonesia and got to bed by about 1:30.

            The first day of almost a week of having nothing to do. We have stayed at Nai Yang a few times and it is quite a nice place for doing nothing. There is about the right amount of development here for us i.e. there are enough shops and restaurants within easy walking distance but it is not over developed yet. There is reasonable diving from here but for some reason it is always expensive compared to other places relatively nearby so we will give that a miss. We still have plenty of diving ahead of us and a week or so off will not do us any harm. The hotel is good with three pools and a few resident tortoises. It has been called Nai Yang Beach Resort since we first stayed here but seems to be in the process of changing its name to "The Sea Turtle" at the moment.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We spent the morning by the pool or in the room. We got take-away fried rice for lunch which we ate on the balcony. After eating, I went for a walk along the beach almost back to the airport and stocked up on provisions for tonight. Roz spent the afternoon by the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started on the Sang Som on the balcony at about 6:30. We had a few drinks before going out to eat. Sunset Point Restaurant was still in the same place. This was our favourite restaurant the last time we were here but such places in Thailand regularly move or disappear altogether. We had excellent meals sat on the beach while getting through a couple more bottles of Sang Som. We got back to the room at about 10:30 but this is a bit of a vague memory.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 15th February</span>
            A similar day to yesterday. Mostly spent reading by the pool. We had a late breakfast so did not bother with lunch. We both went for the walk along the beach to the airport today. We stopped to buy a Thai SIM card and then walked back along the beach as the sun was setting. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at Sunset Point again but had a night off alcohol so were back in the room before 9:00.
            </p>

            Another day spent mostly reading by the pool. We did have our lunch from one of the stalls on the beach and I went out to Tesco to buy drinks but the rest of the day we stayed at the hotel. We got drunk again in the evening with the usual routine of drinks on the balcony, a couple of bottles of Sang Som at Sunset Point with our meal and only vague recollections of getting back to the room.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 17th February</span>
            Another day almost identical to yesterday. Most of the day spent by the pool again. A slight difference in the evening as Swansea v Brentford was on at 11pm. We left Sunset a bit earlier than usual after just the one bottle of Sang Som and went for a beer at a German bar near the hotel. We then started looking for somewhere showing the game without success. We could not find anywhere near-by and could not be bothered to walk out to the bar that was most likely to be showing it so ended up watching it on the tablet on our balcony..... with another bottle of Sang Som.
