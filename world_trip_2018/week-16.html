            We did not have much to do this morning so spent an hour or so walking round the old town again. The old town is quite a nice place but during the day it is packed with passengers from the huge cruise ships which stop here. It was also hotter than the other islands we have been to so after a while we gave up and returned to the hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We checked out at midday and went and sat in McDonalds for 45 minutes while waiting for the 1pm bus out to the airport. We had a couple of hours waiting around at the airport and our flight back to Thessaloníki left about 20 minutes late at 16:00. We landed at Thessaloníki an hour later. It took about ten minutes to get through the airport, another ten minutes to be picked up by the car parking company and by 17:30, we were back with the car. Slightly dirtier than when we left it but otherwise all OK.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-094.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had spent quite a lot of time dithering about where to stay tonight but had chosen a hotel at Lithotopos, just over an hours drive away, slightly off route on the way to Bulgaria. We arrived at the hotel by about 7:00 and had another really nice room with excellent views of the lake below. We are out of school holidays now so such places have become much cheaper and quieter again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This was the first place we have stayed in Greece with fast internet access. I uploaded 120 photos while in Rhodes this morning in just over four hours. I uploaded another 120 from here in about two minutes!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we went straight out to eat. We stopped for a drink at the hotel bar/restaurant which had the same good views of the lake and then walked down to a taverna in the village. We were a bit unsure about eating there as it was a large restaurant with no other customers but we had a good meal with a few bottles of the cheapest retsina we have had since getting to Greece. Ended up more drunk than we had intended to be by the time we walked up to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th September</span>
            We were up relatively early today and, after breakfast, we went out on our bikes for the first time in a couple of weeks. Lithotopos is at the Southern tip of Lake Kerkini. We cycled along the road on the Western side of the lake. I got just about to the Northern end of the lake about ten miles away, Roz turned round after about six miles. It was good to be back on the bikes again and a good place to cycle with not too many hills and very little traffic. Plenty more tortoises again!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were both back at the hotel by 11:30. We checked out and spent an hour or so at the pool. We left just after 1:30 and headed North towards the Bulgarian border about 20 miles away. We crossed the border very easily. The Greek border police were very uninterested in us and there was no-one at all on the Bulgarian side. We had to stop to buy our vignette for driving on Bulgarian roads (€8) but the whole thing only took about ten minutes.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-095.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Once over the border, we only had a 30 minute drive to Melnik where we will spend the next two nights. Melnik is the smallest town in Bulgaria with a population of less than 400. Neither of us had heard of it until we started looking for places to stop on our way home but it is an amazing place. It is full of houses that have been reconstructed  to their original state - 96 of them are described as cultural monuments. I am not really sure what that means but anyway, it is a surprisingly picturesque little town. It is also famous for producing wine (the main attraction) and for the sandstone "pyramids" that surround the town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a half mile drive along the narrow stone track that runs through the centre to get to our hotel right at the end of the town. It is quite a climb up to the hotel but it means we have a balcony with excellent views again. We went straight out for a look around the town and to buy a few bottles of red wine (4 for €10) before heading back to the room. We watched the sun setting from the balcony with the first of the bottles before walking into the centre to eat. Although not far from Greece, the food is straight back to being the same as the food we had in the rest of The Balkans so it was back to Shopska salad and Kebapche... and plenty more red wine!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-096.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th September</span>
            Having seen the town and tasted the wine, we went out this morning to see the third of the attractions here, the Melnik Pyramids. We had looked at a walking trail but decided instead to cycle to Rozhen about five miles away. The pyramids are huge rock formations made from sandstone that are up to 100m high. They cover quite a large area but some of the best examples are to be seen near Rozhen. The ride was very scenic but hard work. Although only five miles,the area is very hilly again. It was about a 3.5 mile climb out of Melnik then a mile down a steeper hill into Rozhen. The views did make it worthwhile. When we got back to Melnik, I cycled about five miles in the other direction. I wanted to go further but was heading down a very long steep hill and decided I needed to turn round or I would not have got back up again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch on the balcony and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from a walk into the centre again to buy 12 more bottles of wine to take with us. We returned to the same restaurant as yesterday to eat in the evening and had exactly the same meal again. Just as good as last night with a bit less wine.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th September</span>
            335 miles in the car today. We are heading for Istria in Croatia. We want to stay in Rovinj for about a week and then meet Aleks and Andi in Pula for a few days. Our plan is to get there on Saturday and split the drive over three days. The shortest route would be via Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro but we would need to buy additional car insurance for these countries and the roads there are not very good so we are going the slightly longer route via Serbia. Our aim for today was Smederevo, on The Danube, just West of Belgrade. We left Melnik after breakfast, just after 9:00.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-097.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed North from Melnik until we joined the Sofia ring road. We were only on that for one junction before turning North-West towards the Serbian border. We noticed that this road had a lot of German cars on it and we soon realised that we were on the main route between Turkey and Germany. A lot of Germany's Turkish population were on there way back to Germany at the end of their summer holidays. This meant that there was total chaos at the border. Every border we have crossed so far has taken a matter of minutes but this one took 1 hour, 20 minutes as the border  police on the Serbian side struggled with the amount of vehicles going through. We were lucky to be in the right place when additional gates were opened on the other side of the road or would have been there at least two hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was a new motorway opened part of the way from the border to Niš so this part of the journey was quicker than expected and we recovered some of the time lost at the border. We stopped for lunch at a service station North of Niš and then had a pretty good journey up the motorway, arriving in Smederevo just after 4:00, Serbian time. An eight hour journey in total.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove along the river until we found somewhere to stay for the night. We were planning on going out on our bikes but there did not appear to be a cycle path where we were and we were both worn out anyway so didn't bother. We were not within walking distance of any restaurants so after an hour or so at the hotel, we drove back into the centre and bought food from a supermarket. We had sandwiches on our balcony and an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th September</span>
            Another 320 miles today. We had a sightly earlier start today leaving just after 8:00. It was slow going getting back to the motorway and slow again getting round Belgrade. However, once round Belgrade, it is very fast toll motorway all the way to Zagreb. The border between Serbia and Croatia was busy, but not as busy as yesterday's and we were through in about 50 minutes. We had lunch at a motorway picnic area and had made it to Karlovac by about 15:00 (about 130 miles left to drive tomorrow to get to Rovinj).
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-098.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">As with last night, we did not have anywhere booked. Roz had found somewhere on Booking.com that looked OK so we drove a few miles out of town and were able to get a studio apartment there for the night for €40.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It had started raining by the time we arrived so we left it an hour or so before going out on our bikes. We cycled into the centre for a look round the few sites. It is a nice enough old town with plenty of bars without being too exciting. We tried to find a cycle route without too much success so headed out in a random direction for a few miles more before cycling back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After taking the bikes back, we walked along to the army museum which is only a couple of hundred metres away from where we are staying. I am not sure if the main museum has been finished yet or is open to the public but the area outside has a MIG 21 plane as well as a few tanks and other vehicles left over from the war in Yugoslavia (or Croatian War of Independence as it is known here) in the nineties.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Again, we were not really near any restaurants and we could not be bothered to go back into town so we ate at a fast food Ćevapi place just down the road and had another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th September</span>
            We completed our journey to Rovinj this morning. We left Karlova by about 9:30. It took about 10 minutes to get back to the motorway and then had an easy two hour drive down the motorway to within 10 miles of Rovinj. We arrived there by about midday. We planned to stay here for a week but had not booked anywhere to stay yet. We had found somewhere on Booking.com that we wanted to stay and hoped to get a cheaper price by turning up and going direct to the owner. However, the apartment became unavailable as we were driving down and when we arrived, the owner confirmed it was full.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the car outside the apartment and spent an hour or so walking round looking at other options. We looked at a few places but the best option by a long way was a two story, two bedroom apartment that was only available for four nights. We were offered it for a good price as the owner was happy for it to be full until the next people turn up. We decided that we would take this and reconsider what to do from Wednesday onwards. We will either find somewhere else nearby or head towards Pula and stop for a few nights on the way.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-099.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of hours to kill while the apartment was being cleaned so we wandered down to the dive centre that is on the sea front a few minutes walk from the apartment. We were not sure how many dives we want to do but booked one dive for Monday afternoon and another for Tuesday morning. The one on Tuesday is the most famous wreck in the area and is a deep dive. The one on Monday is to get used to diving again before diving the wreck.  
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We filled the car with petrol and went shopping to Lidl before going back to the apartment at 3:00. We had lunch in the apartment and I then went out on my bike for an hour. Roz stayed in to follow the football; I came back for the second half (Swansea weren't playing).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started on the wine at about 7:00. We had found another bottle of Macedonian wine when emptying the boot of the car. Roz started drinking that while I drank the plastic bottle of red that we had bought in Melnik.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We walked back into the old town to eat and returned to Pizzeria Leone, a restaurant we visited several times when we first came to Rovinj in 2006. It had not changed much and the jumbo pizzas were still excellent. We walked back to the apartment and continued drinking the wine while watching England v Spain and the US Open tennis final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th September</span>
            Did not do much all morning. At midday we went for a walk into the old town and tried to find the place we had stayed in 12 years ago. We went back to the apartment for lunch and then went out on the bikes. Roz did about five miles before stopping at a beach for a couple of hours. I continued cycling South of Rovinj for about the same length of time and did a total of 24 miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into the old town a bit earlier tonight and walked right round the peninsular that the town sits on. We went back to Pizzeria Leone for another excellent pizza.
            </p>
