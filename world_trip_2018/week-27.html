            Another day spent mainly in the car. We left Lakes Entrance just before 10:00 and continued our journey North on Princes Highway towards Sydney. We had not really decided how far to drive today but after setting off, we decided to aim for Ulladulla, not only because Roz liked the name, but a couple of people had recommended the area to us.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The drive was fairly straight-forward again. We had a stop at about 1pm at Eden, just inside the N.S.W. border. This town is famous for whale watching. We stood at the whale watching viewpoint for about five minutes before getting bored and going to buy things for lunch instead. We ate at the picnic area near the viewpoint, filled up with petrol and continued North for another three and a half hours to Ulladulla. We looked at a few rooms before choosing The Harbour View Motel. We booked a very nice room for two nights which does just about have a view of the harbour from the balcony. It is right in the middle of Ulladulla so ideal for shops and restaurants.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went for a quick look around and found a supermarket and BYO Thai restaurant both about two minutes walk away from us. We had a few drinks in the apartment before going out to eat at the Thai restaurant. Had a very good meal and returned to the room to finish off our first bottle of duty free rum.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 20th November</span>
            A day with nothing at all to do which was much needed after the last week or so. We went for a walk around the harbour and to buy food for lunch but spent most of the day sorting out photos and making a few more bookings for next year. We have confirmed that we will return to both Derawan and Mabul before flying home from Hong Kong so now know what we are doing just about all the way through until the middle of April.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few glasses of wine again in the evening before going back to the same Thai restaurant as last night. Had a slightly more sober evening and a relatively early night. Found out this evening that the S95 I bought on ebay has arrived at the hotel in Cairns which was good news.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 21st November</span>
            We checked out of the motel and were back on the Princes Highway by 9:45. It should have taken three hours to get to Sydney but it ended up being closer to four. We had taken a scenic detour when we needed to buy petrol and then turned up at the airport to find that Ace Car Hire had their office about five miles away. Anyway, by 14:00 we had returned the car and used Uber to get us a taxi into the centre of Sydney. For two of us, this was about the same cost as using public transport and was a lot easier with the amount of luggage we have.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-145.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We checked into "DD Apartments on Broadway" and have another very nice apartment just round the corner from Central Station. We had lunch in the apartment before heading out for the rest of the day. The weather was not great for sight-seeing so instead we went out to Bondi to have a look around the area we lived in 29 years ago. We got the train from Central to Bondi Junction and from there, the 389 bus down to North Bondi. We got off at O'Donnell Street and walked down to No. 68 where we had shared a flat when we lived here. After standing around for a few minutes taking photos and trying to work out whether or not it had changed since we lived there, we walked down to the beach. A few more photos then straight into the Bondi Hotel where we had spent a lot of time during our stay here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The pub has changed beyond recognition since 1989. The back, slightly rougher, bar with the pool tables has gone completely and the front bars have been altered and heavily modernised. It is no-where near as good as it once was but it was still good to sit there for a couple of hours remembering previous sessions. We were lucky to time our visit there with the start of the 5pm - 7pm happy hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we left the pub, we got the bus back up to Bondi Junction. We had planned to get off there but the bus continued to the city via Paddington so we decided to go there instead. We went to a couple more pubs before finding a BYO pizza restaurant. The one we used to go to is no longer there but this one was pretty good. We got through another couple of bottles of wine before using Uber again to get a taxi back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 22nd November</span>
            We left the apartment by about 10:30 for a few hours of sight-seeing. We are staying a couple of miles from Circular Quay so walked there along George Street stopping at the Town Hall and Victoria Building on the way. We also walked past the Centrepoint Tower or whatever it is called now and Martin Place. Martin Place, like a lot of the centre was being rebuilt to accommodate the new tram/metro system that is going right through the centre. We spent an hour or so taking pictures of the bridge and walking round the opera house. We then spent another hour walking round the botanical gardens, mainly for the views looking back at the opera house with bridge in the background.

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the apartment via a couple of souvenir shops and an Asian food court for lunch. We had less than an hour in the apartment before heading out again. Australia has not been as expensive as we had expected it to be but the one thing that does cost a lot is drinking in pubs. The way round this is to start early and take advantage of the happy hours!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got the bus from just outside our apartment to Paddington and went first to The Imperial whose happy hour was from 4 - 6. We had a couple in there before moving to The Paddo Inn (5 - 7). We think we had been in there a few times 29 years ago but the name has changed and the pub has also changed beyond recognition. Still, it was a very good pub and we stayed there until after the happy hour ended. We walked from there to The Unicorn which had been voted one of Sydney's best pubs. It was another good pub and had probably the best beer we have had since getting to Australia. Still too cold and fizzy but not as cold and fizzy as everything else we have had so far. After a couple in there, we returned to Arthur's Pizza Restaurant for another very good pizza. Don't really remember getting back to the apartment!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 23rd November</span>
            We had seen just about everything we wanted to see in Sydney so did not go out today until about midday. Spent the morning sorting out photos, doing washing and going through our luggage to find stuff that we no longer need to carry around with us. First stop when we did go out was the post office where we sent home a 5kg parcel mainly containing things we do not need for the rest of the trip like clothes and broken cameras as well as a few souvenirs/presents. We walked from there to Darling Harbour which was OK to wander round without being too exciting, and then back into The Rocks and down to Circular Quay for another look at the opera house.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-147.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We stopped for a Mexican take-away on the way back to the apartment and ate it with the end of last night's pizza for lunch. We did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We went out for the evening a bit later than the last two nights and got the train out to Bondi Junction again just after 6:00. We walked to the Bondi Tea Gardens, another of our regular pubs from 29 years ago. Fortunately, this seemed to have hardly changed at all since we were first here. We had a couple in there before walking down Bondi Road to a Thai BYO. Most of the restaurants we used to eat in no longer exist but we had seen this one from the bus a couple of days ago and had another very good meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating we got the bus back to Circular Quay. When we lived here, I don't remember ever going to look at the bridge and opera house when they were lit up at night but it was something I was keen on seeing and it was well worth doing. We stayed around taking more photos for 10 - 15 minutes (it was too cold to stay any longer) before getting the train back to Central Station and walking back to the apartment. We finished the box of wine that we had bought in Bondi but had a relatively early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 24th November</span>
            We checked out of the apartment just before 11:00 and used Uber again to get a taxi to the airport. We checked in without any problems, had lunch in Mad Mex, the same chain that we bought lunch from yesterday and waited for the 13:15 Tiger Air flight to Cairns. We boarded without having our hand-luggage weighed which was good news and departed about 15 minutes late at 13:30. (Tiger Air is a budget airline. They have loads of signs saying that hand luggage will be weighed and you have to pay if yours is over 7kg. Both of ours contain dive equipment and weigh a lot more than that)
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We landed in Cairns just after 15:00 local time - Queensland being an hour behind N.S.W. We got our luggage and booked our second Uber of the day to get us the 5km or so into the centre of Cairns. We were taken to our hotel which is on the Esplanade just before it starts getting busy. When we checked in, I was given my camera so we are now up to having three underwater cameras for our live-aboard on Monday!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-148.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We left our luggage in the room and went straight out for a look around Cairns. Cairns is another place that has changed completely since we first stayed here. Most of the buildings that used to line The Esplanade have been knocked down and replaced with newer hotels. It used to be full of backpacker accommodation and cheap restaurants but now is a lot more upmarket. It probably is an improvement but still a bit sad that there is nothing at all recognisable from previous visits. We looked round a couple of dive shops and went to a supermarket before walking back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going out to eat. We ate at another Thai BYO restaurant. The food we had here was by far the best Thai food we have ever had outside of Thailand and the beef massaman was probably the best we have ever had anywhere. We had a couple of bottles of wine with the meal and then returned to The Esplanade and the Bavarian Beerhouse. Here, beer was a lot cheaper if you bought it in a 3 litre beer tube...... so we were just about forced into having 3 litres of Bavarian Gold which was a lot nicer than most of the Australian beer we have been drinking. We don't remember too much about the walk home and failed to stay awake for the football at 1am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 25th November</span>
            A typical Sunday of not doing a lot. We walked into the centre for breakfast at McDonalds and also walked out to find the Mike Ball office where we have to be by about 6:30am tomorrow. I bought a rash vest for the trip and we went to look round a souvenir shop. Spent most of the rest of the day in the room. It is considerably warmer and more humid in Cairns than it was further South and staying in air conditioning all day was more pleasant than being outside. We also wanted to make the most of having Wi-Fi as we probably wont have for the next week. Roz booked a few more Air Asia flights for April and March meaning that all our flights are now booked up until we go home in April. We also got all our dive gear and cameras ready for tomorrow.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We finally left the room at about 7pm to go and eat at the Thai restaurant again. We had an identical meal to yesterday and it was just as good. We had a much needed night off alcohol and were back in the room again by 9:00.
