            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 30th July</span>
            Last night was the last time for a few days that we would have an apartment so we cooked the remainder of our sausages for breakfast before checking out at about 10:00. Our next stop was to be Meteora another drive of about two hours. We stopped at the supermarket on the way out of Ioannina to stock up on drinks again before heading back to the motorway we had come in on a couple of days ago. The drive was straight-forward again and we arrived at our hotel in Kastraki just after midday.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-069.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Meteora is a series of massive rock pinnacles which are fairly spectacular on their own. However, in the 14th century, monks somehow managed to build monasteries on top of 24 of them. Six of the monasteries still remain and are one of Greece's top tourist attractions. We had wanted to visit when we were traveling in 2006 but for a couple of reasons did not make it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were unable to check into our room when we arrived so went off to visit Great Meteor Monastery which is the furthest away from where we are staying and only really accessible by car. It is only 5km away but the hills are steep here and it is too hot for cycling that sort of hill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first thing that hit us as we parked the car was the number of tourists around. Everywhere we have been since leaving Russia has been relatively quiet with not that many people around. Even at Ohrid, it was easy enough to escape the crowds. As we approached the monastery, there were people, cars and buses everywhere. I think we had got there just about at peak time because a lot of the buses were leaving and it did quieten down once we were inside. The monastery itself was quite nice to wander around but it is the location of them all that makes the place so spectacular. There are stairs cut into the rock now to get up to them but when they were first built, monks were hoisted up in baskets. Walking up the steps was hard work. The fact that people were able to build anything on the rocks is incredible.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once at the top, most of our time was taken by looking at the views of the other monasteries in the area. Three of them are all close together so you got good views of the other two from where we were. When we had finished walking round there, we went back to the car stopping at viewpoints on the way. We drove round a couple more places where there are good views before driving back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our hotel, Spanias Hotel, is just outside the village of Kastraki and we have a room with a balcony overlooking plenty of the pinnacles. We had lunch on the balcony and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from listening to the thunder storms which seemed to just miss us. I went out on my bike at 5ish. I only did a few miles as every direction from where we are staying is hilly but I made it into the main town here, Kalabaka, and then back into the village of Kastraki.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into Kastraki to eat in the evening. We walked through the village and found a taverna the other side of the centre where we had probably the best meal since we got to Greece. Back in the room before 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 31st July</span>
            We were up early this morning as we wanted to get our sight-seeing started before the crowds started building. We had breakfast at 7:30 and left the hotel just after 8:00. We cycled about 1.5 miles into Kalabaka and locked up our bikes at the bottom of a walking trail that leads up the hill to another monastery - Agia Trias. It was not too hard a walk but it was already starting to get hot. We got to the monastery just after 9:00 when it opened and were inside with only a few other tourists. Once again, the monastery was reasonably interesting but it was the views of the other monasteries and the surrounding scenery that was most spectacular.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-070.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked up to the parking area on the road and from there could keep walking along the road for about 10 - 15 minutes until we got to the Agio Stefanos Monastery. This one was a lot more accessible for people who can not be bothered to walk too far, as the car park was at the same level as the entrance and there were hardly any steps. We decided not to go into this one. Unless you are really keen, the insides of the monasteries are all fairly similar and it costs â‚¬3 to get into each one. The views of the outside were better from the road and the number of buses already in the car park was also off-putting. We walked back to the first one, down the hill again and back to our bikes. We cycled back to the hotel and were in our room again by midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch on the balcony again and did not do much until 5ish when we went out in the car. We went to have a look at the Varlaam Monastery despite the fact we knew it would be closed. This is the one closest to the first one we went to yesterday. Yesterday it was packed with tourists but today at 5, it was closed so only a few people around. We were happy just to walk around the outside and up to the main gate. We drove from there along the ridge above Meteora to get the views looking down at the hills. It started raining while we were doing this so we gave up and headed back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once again in the evening, we had more wine than we had planned. We had a couple of drinks before going out. We ate in a different taverna to last night. The food was not quite as good but the wine better. Had a few more drinks on the balcony when we got back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 1st August</span>
            An uneventful morning apart from having to spend about 15 minutes trying to find our room key which we had somehow managed to carefully hide last night. We went out to buy cheese pies for lunch but spent most of the day sorting out e-mails and planning a bit more about what we will do from December onwards. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have seen just about everything we wanted to in Meteora but at about 3:00, we went out for a walk to the natural rock obelisk that stands in the centre of the area. Again, this was not too spectacular but the scenery all around it was and it was a nice enough walk. We also found four more tortoises as we walked up the hill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the taverna we had eaten at two nights ago in the evening. The food was excellent again. No wine tonight as we have a long drive tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd August</span>
            We had breakfast, loaded the car, reattached the bikes and were on our way by 8:30. We had a drive of about 200km to get to Tsagarada. We stopped at Lidl to stock up on food before leaving Kalabaka and had one more stop for petrol. Most of the distance was done in the first two hours but we then had to drive through the city of Volos and the last 22 miles was along narrow, windy, hilly roads so took over an hour. We had booked a "cottage" for five days before we left home back in April. We had to phone the owners when we arrived as the cottage was not sign-posted and just about impossible to find. They were at the property to direct us when we arrived or we would never have found the place.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-071.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The cottage is excellent. It is high on a mountain and a bit isolated but has a fully equipped kitchen, a bedroom, a lounge/dining area that is far bigger than we need and, the best bit, a large terrace that overlooks the sea. The terrace has an eating area, sun-loungers and a hot-tub. I think we will be spending most of the next five days here!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The cottage was still being cleaned when we arrived (we had arrived a lot earlier than we had said we would be there) so we went for a walk while we waited. After we had got all our stuff in, we drove back to the village to buy a couple more things we needed and returned to the terrace for lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Spent most of the rest of the day on the terrace. We had a few drinks in the evening and finally opened the the five litre keg of Ghost Ship that we had been carrying since we left home. It did not seem too badly affected by being left in the boot of the car for two months. We ate quite late and carried on drinking wine until about 1:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd August</span>
            I was woken by heavy rain just after 3:00. It was still raining when I got up at 8:15 and the glasses that we had left empty on the table on the terrace showed that over an inch of rain had fallen since we had gone to bed. Roz's iPad had also been left out on the table but had somehow survived and still seemed to be working OK. 
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-072.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go for a walk today and with the weather still being relatively cool decided to go at about 11:30. Roz changed her mind at the last minute and stayed on the terrace. I walked to Fakistra beach which is a mile or so down the hill. We thought we had been told that it was an 18 minute walk from where we were staying. This always seemed unlikely given how high up we were and it turned out to be an 18 minute walk from where the road ended. The beach did not look too appealing but this may have been due to the weather in the last 24 hours or so. From there it was a rough muddy path along the coast to a view point from where you could see a second beach at Damouchari. Then it was a very long, hot walk back up the hill. I got back to the cottage at about 2:30 and needed a good half hour in the hot tub to recover.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was another afternoon of not doing much. We are still trying to plan our itinerary for next January but the internet speeds here are not great if the connection is up at all so it is quite hard work to research anything.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Ate on the terrace again and spent an hour or so looking at and sorting out photos from earlier in the trip. Only a couple of pints of Ghost Ship tonight so a much earlier and more sober night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 4th August</span>
            We were both up to walking this morning so walked down the hill to Fakistra beach. The beach is not great and probably still does not look its best after another big storm last night. The sea was quite rough and not particularly inviting. The beach is also quite small and being a Saturday, was starting to fill up. We spent half an hour lying in the sun before walking back up to the cottage.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-073.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not leave the cottage for the rest of the day. After recovering from our walk in the hot-tub again, we listened to commentary of the last day of the first test. This ended just in time for the start of Sunderland's opening game of the season at 14:30. The internet connection here is not up to streaming games but we were able to follow what was going on as they beat Charlton 2 - 1.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started drinking before the Swansea game started at 19:30. We did attempt to watch this game but again the connection was not really fast enough to watch it properly. As with the Sunderland game, it was enough to be able to keep up with what was happening. We ate after this game had finished (Sheff Utd 1, Swansea 2) and carried on drinking on the terrace after we had eaten. The excitement of both Swansea and Sunderland winning on the opening day of the season seemed to result in us drinking too much and not really remembering going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 5th August</span>
            Hungover! Did not leave the cottage all day.
            </p>
