            Last night was the last time for a few days that we would have an apartment so we cooked the remainder of our sausages for breakfast before checking out at about 10:00. Our next stop was to be Meteora another drive of about two hours. We stopped at the supermarket on the way out of Ioannina to stock up on drinks again before heading back to the motorway we had come in on a couple of days ago. The drive was straight-forward again and we arrived at our hotel in Kastraki just after midday.

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-069.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Meteora is a series of massive rock pinnacles which are fairly spectacular on their own. However, in the 14th century, monks somehow managed to build monasteries on top of 24 of them. Six of the monasteries still remain and are one of Greece's top tourist attractions. We were unable to check into our room when we arrived so went off to visit Great Meteor Monastery which is the furthest away from where we are staying and only really accessible by car. It is only 5km away but the hills are steep here and it is too hot for cycling that sort of hill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first thing that hit us as we parked the car was the number of tourists around. Everywhere we have been since leaving Russia has been relatively quiet with not that many people around. Even at Ohrid, it was easy enough to escape the crowds. As we approached the monastery, there were people, cars and buses everywhere. I think we had got there just about at peak time because a lot of the buses were leaving and it did quieten down once we were inside. The monastery itself was quite nice to wander around but it is the location of them all that makes the place so spectacular. There are stairs cut into the rock now to get up to them but when they were first built, monks were hoisted up in baskets. Walking up the steps was hard work. The fact that people were able to build anything on the rocks is incredible.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once at the top, most of our time was taken by looking at the views of the other monasteries in the area. Three of them are all close together so you got good views of the other two from where we were. When we had finished walking round there, we went back to the car stopping at viewpoints on the way. We drove round a couple more places where there are good views before driving back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our hotel, Spanias Hotel, is just outside the village of Kastraki and we have a room with a balcony overlooking plenty of the pinnacles. We had lunch on the balcony and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon apart from listening to the thunder storms which seemed to just miss us. I went out on my bike at 5ish. I only did a few miles as every direction from where we are staying is hilly but I made it into the main town here, Kalabaka, and then back into the village of Kastraki.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into Kastraki to eat in the evening. We walked through the village and found a taverna the other side of the centre where we had probably the best meal since we got to Greece. Back in the room before 10:00.
