            We had booked a taxi for 8:30 to take us back to the airport. We checked in without any problems and the 10:30 MAS Wings flight left on time for the 30 minute flight to Tarakan. Immigration had been very slow for foreigners last time we were here but we were first off the plane this time and got close to the front of the queue despite being bused to the terminal. Once through Roz was able to get money out of the ATM first go but I had to have a few attempts and an exchange of texts with Santander before my card would work. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We sorted out our SIMs for the next coupe of weeks. I could top up my old Indonesian SIM and Roz was somehow able to top up hers despite the fact that we thought it had expired. There were seven other guests being picked up (all Spanish) so once everyone else had sorted themselves out, we were driven to the port for the three hour boat trip to Derawan. We had to wait for four more people (all French) and the boats left just after 1pm.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-238.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at Scuba Junkie just after 4 and were met on the jetty by most of the same staff that were here when we left in October. The resort is quite full again. As well as the thirteen new arrivals, there were four guests already here (also French we think).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were allowed to miss the briefing and went straight back to the room we had stayed in last time. Everything pretty much the same except for the addition of an air-con unit. We unpacked everything, took our dive stuff to the dive centre, filled out our paperwork and were sat on the balcony watching turtles before the sun had set.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out to eat at the restaurant that we had eaten here most of the time in October. The food was still quite good but the service as bad as ever. Roz's meal came about 10 - 15 minutes after mine and they totally forgot our drinks despite there being hardly anyone else in the restaurant. Back in the room by 8pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 12th February</span>
            Straight back into the same routine as when we were here before i.e. 7:00 breakfast, 7:45 on the jetty to sort out our gear and 8:00 departure. We were on the small boat today with two of the French group that were here when we arrived. We were in a group on our own led by Rocky, a new guide who was not here when we were here last time. Theresa was also on the boat leading the others. Our first two dives were at Samama Island.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-239.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had dived at Samama in October and it was not the best of the dive locations here. Again today, both dives were poor. We did see a yellow box fish on the first dive at Sama Sama, but there was hardly anything of interest on the second at Godec. On the second dive Rocky only pointed out one thing and that was too small for me to see. The first dive in a long time where I have not taken a single picture.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the second dive, we went back to Derawan and had lunch before diving one of the local sites. This was a much better dive. We saw a few good nudibranchs, an octopus, cuttle fish and our first turtles of the visit. Roz counted twelve in total. The turtles here are all bigger than the ones we have been seeing elsewhere and appear huge when you see them for the first time again. Rocky was not great on this dive either. He seems to lose interest after about 40 minutes and is very keen to get out of the water as soon as the 60 minutes is up. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate in our usual restaurant where as expected the food was good and the service slow. We had a quick walk through the village and were back in the room by 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 13th February</span>
            Three dives today at Kakaban. The French group that were on the boat with us yesterday had all departed at 5:30 this morning and were replaced with the other French group that we had traveled from Tarakan with. We were guided by Rocky again.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-240.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Meditation Wall. This was very nice. The vis was excellent, it was quite a spectacular wall and we saw a hawksbill turtle. After the first dive we had another visit to the jellyfish lake. This was very good again and we managed not to get eaten by horse-flies as we did the last time we visited. The second dive was at Barracuda Point and was by far the best dive of the day. There are always strong currents here but the currents can bring in the big fish and  today was no exception. We saw the big school of barracuda, four sharks - two white tips and two grey reef sharks - lots of bat fish and three turtles. Two of the turtles were hawksbills and one of them hit me with a flipper as he came to have a look at my camera.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was at a site we had not dived before, Kakabanana. This was nice enough without being anywhere near as good as the previous one. Once again today, we were not that impressed with Rocky as the dive times were all 60 or 61 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at Derawan by about 4:30. We washed our equipment and then managed to repair Roz's BCD.  At the start of the third dive the low pressure inflater hose had broken meaning she could not put air into it for the whole dive. This was not a big problem on the dive but a part had fallen out of it and it needs replacing. They do not have spares here but Jordon showed me what he calls the "Rubble Drawer" which contains a whole collection of random broken spare parts. Luckily, the only inflater hose in there was an exact match for Roz's and seems to be working.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I also complained to Jordon about Rocky and his dive times and general lack of enthusiasm. He thanked me for the comments but we still seem to be diving with Rocky tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate in the usual place and for once had nothing that we could complain about!
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 14th February</span>
            A much better days diving today. We were diving at Sangalaki, one of the main reasons for visiting Derawan. We saw mantas on all three dives and Rocky was much better today. I am not sure what Jordon and Theresa had said to him but he was much livelier both in and out of the water and we had dives of 66, 68 and 66 minutes. We are not really sure which dive sites we dived today. They are all fairly close together and a lot of the dives involve moving between them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">On the first dive, we went in at the big cleaning station. We waited around here for a few minutes without any luck and moved to the other cleaning stations. We stayed in that area for a while. We did not see any mantas on the cleaning stations but did see a few swimming past us. In total on the dive we reckoned that we saw about seven or eight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">On the second dive, we drifted down to the Manta Tease cleaning station. It took most of the dive to get there and we still had not seen manta by the time we got there. We found a hawksbill turtle next to the cleaning station and stayed with it a few minutes before drifting past it. We were then with the same hawksbill further down the reef when everyone started swimming back towards the cleaning station. This was quite hard work as we were going into strong current but it was worth it as there was a huge manta there for a couple of minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">On the third dive we saw at least ten. I could see one as soon as we entered the water, we saw a few as we drifted along the reef and then came to an area where there were several of them at the surface. This is not the best way to see them but was still good. We got back on the boat and the French group were not so happy as they had not seen a single manta all day which was a shame. They were very subdued on the journey back to Derawan!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz's BCD was still not working correctly today. The hose that we fitted had a free-flowing valve (probably the reason why it was in the Rubble Drawer!) meaning that the BCD kept filling with air on the first dive. We disconnected the low pressure hose for the next dives. Not ideal but will have to do until we get a more permanent solution. We have all the parts from the two hoses to make one good one but no-one here seems to know how to do that and I do not have the tools to do it myself.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Another night where we had reasonable service and good food. All the guests from Scuba Junkie seem to be eating there now but we were the first there tonight so were still served quite quickly. Back in the room just after 8:00 to listen to the Karaoke which has started up again. At least with the air-con we do not have to have our doors open which is a big improvement.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 15th February</span>
            Three dives today at Maratua. Same people on the boat as the last couple of days apart from Alain the snorkeler from the French group who was having a day off. The three dives were at Fusilier Paradise, Hanging Garden and Gusung Pal. All three dives were good although there was a disappointing number of turtles. We saw 21 in total (twelve on the first, seven on the second and two on the third) but this was the island where we saw 91 on a single dive in November so were hoping for more. We did know the numbers would be lower today as the tide is higher. Hopefully the conditions will be better when we come back next week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The visibility was very good again on all the dives. The best dive of the day was the first one. We went down to a plateau at about 24m and along the edge of this, there was a lot of big fish activity. There were a couple of sharks and eagle rays (that we didn't see) and some big schools of barracuda (that we did see). This dive also had the most turtle activity. The next two dives were good without being as spectacular as the first.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. Ate in our usual restaurant. Quick efficient service with both meals turning up at the same time within about 10 - 15 minutes of us ordering. Remarkable!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-243.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 16th February</span>
            It was back to Kakaban today. We dived Barracuda Point first and this was probably the best dive of the day. There were plenty of sharks around on the plateau including a group of three baby sharks under a table coral. The current was not so strong today and we did not see the big school of barracuda. When we left the plateau and got to the wall we found a hawksbill turtle that we were able to stay with for about ten minutes or so. This was the only turtle of the day but it was a quality one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Crack In. This was another nice enough wall dive. There are no-where near as many fish on the walls here as in Bunaken but we did have an unexpected manta on this dive. We were all looking at the wall when I thought I could hear dolphins. I turned to look into the blue to see a large manta swimming past. The third dive was at Kakaban Jetty, a site we had not dived before. Again a nice enough dive without the manta.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The same sort of evening as usual. Good service again but average food tonight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 17th February</span>
            Today was supposed to be three dives at Sangalaki but this changed because of the conditions. When we got to Sangalaki, the sea was very rough with the forecast for it to get rougher. After the first dive, it was decided that the boats would return to Derawan stopping at Samama for the second dive on the way. By the time we were at Samama, it was decided to go straight back to Derawan and two the second and third dives there as things were getting worse quicker than expected. This all meant one dive at Sangalaki and two at Derawan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive at Sangalaki was very good again with plenty of manta sightings. We saw about nine or ten in total with some coming very close to us. There were none at the feeding stations but most of them swam past us with a couple on the surface. This time, the French group also saw some which was good as this was their last chance.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dives back at Derawan were OK without being too spectacular. We dived Tortoruga and Ghost Wreck with lunch back at the resort in between. We were diving when the tide was quite high on both dives meaning not a lot of turtles. We did see two on the second dive but none at all on the third.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-244.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The tide being high means that the turtles are all eating in the shallows. As soon as we were back form the third dive, we washed our gear and went straight back in the water, this time snorkeling in the area in front of our room. I spent about half an hour looking at the turtles. Roz stayed about twice that time and counted 23 of them. We had a very nice sunset to watch from our balcony before going out to eat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The restaurant we eat in was showing a complete re-run of the Swansea v Man City game from last night. It was quite strange sitting in a small restaurant that is not much more than a wooden shack, on a tiny island off Indonesian Borneo listening to Hymns and Arias being sung at The Liberty. I had no desire to watch the match due to the way we lost but we were in there for most of the second half. Service pretty good again. We said goodbye to the French lot who leave tomorrow (as do the Spanish group) and were back in the room just after 8:00.
