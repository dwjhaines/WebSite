            As with the start of the previous trip, it was a 6:00 start with the extended dive briefing at 6:30. As there were less divers on the boat, we were put into two groups of four and two groups of two. We were on our own diving with Sofi who we dived with in Myanmar on the trip last year. We were Group 2 today but Franck's group was the other group of two, and we all went in just about together just after 7:00.

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-233.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first day of the trip was around the Surin Islands, an area we had not dived before. First dive was at Koh Cai. This was the check dives and was not great. We did see a few nudibranchs and an ornate ghost pipe fish but the vis not wonderful and the dive was pretty average.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second and third dives were a lot better. On the second at Torinla we saw bump-head parrot fish, a Napoleon wrasse, a few large rays and a hawksbill turtle. I spotted the turtle in the shallows after about 40 minutes and we spent 10 minutes with it before we had to leave it. The third dive at Yellow Rock was a submerged pinnacle and a very nice site. The pinnacle was surrounded by big boulders and the whole site was covered in fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was not great. I don't think Sofi is quite as enthusiastic about night dives as Julien was. The dive time was limited to 52 minutes and we went in slightly earlier than we had been doing. The dive was OK but there was nothing too spectacular to see. I was totally worn out by the time we had finished the night dive and was in bed not long after finishing eating.

            Today's dives were at Koh Bon and Koh Tachai, with the first dive at Koh Bon Ridge. You used to be virtually guaranteed to see manta rays here at this time of year and we have had some superb dives here. However, we have not seen mantas here since 2010 and the dives we did here last year were really poor so we were not too hopeful. We still did not see manta but it was a much better dive this year. We spent more time out on the deeper part of the ridge than last time and then headed back to that end of the ridge as we shallowed up. Last year we just continued drifting North over a lot of dead coral. Once again, there were a lot of fish all over the site despite the state of the coral.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Koh Bon Pinnacle. This is a very nice submerged pinnacle with the top at about 18m. We had 30 minutes on the pinnacle itself which was excellent. There were a lot of big schools of glass fish around and schools of bigger fish hunting amongst them. We were all getting low on bottom time after 30 minutes so attempted to cross back to the ridge. Sofi did not have a compass so we were relying on mine. We gave up after about 15 minutes and did our safety stop although we had almost made it and would have got there if we had kept going a few more minutes.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-234.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The third and fourth dives of the day were at Koh Tachai Pinnacle. We have had good dives here before but have also had some pretty poor ones. There can be very strong currents here and this has been a big problem in the past, particularly when we had less experience. Today we had examples of both the good and the bad.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the first, the conditions were good and it was a relatively easy dive. There were a lot of big travallys and tuna around and a very spectacular school of barracuda. Unfortunately my camera housing flooded again on this dive. The camera is fine but it meant I could not take photos. By the time we went in for the second, the conditions were a lot worse. The current had picked up and the visibility was getting worse as we headed towards sunset. The current was manageable and the dive was still OK but no-where near as good as the previous one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back on the boat, it was bar-b-q night again. Very similar to the one last week and another good night.

            The last three dives of the live-aboard today, all at Richelieu Rock, Thailand's best dive site. It was still dark when we went in for the first dive just after 6am. This was not the best time to see this dive site as one of the as it is better in bright sun light but it was a nice enough dive and we saw two ghost pipe fish. Flooded camera housing again on this dive but I think I have now worked out what the problem is so hopefully it wont happen again.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-235.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was one of the best we have had here as we saw two whale sharks. It is at this site that we first saw a whale shark back in 2007 and we have only seen them on one other site since. We were looking for a seahorse at about 30m when we saw the first. It was a very small one - only about 2.5m but had a school of jacks following it so was a spectacular sight. We were on our own with this one for a minute or so as we followed it up the reef. A few minutes after we had left this one, we spotted a second one. We were up to about 14m by this time and had a hard swim into strong current to keep sight of it. We were rewarded for our efforts a minute or two later when it turned round and swam around us a few times. This one was bigger, between 4 and 5m long and was close enough to touch for some of the time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was not quite as spectacular but still very nice. We gave up on the sea-horse and stayed at about 18m meaning a longer dive. The shallow parts are the best part of the dive site as the coral is very colourful and there are a lot of fish. There was a huge school of jacks together with giant travallys and barracuda circling the rock and big schools of glass fish everywhere for them to hunt. An excellent end to the live-aboard.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on the boat for lunch and then had a six and a half hour trip back to Ranong. The journey went quite quickly, sorting out our dive gear, packing, swapping photos, a couple of beers, etc. We were back in Ranong by 8pm, said our goodbyes to the crew and were all taken by taxi to our hotels. We were back in the Tinadee again for one night. We checked in at 9ish and could not be bothered to go out to eat. We were both worn out so made do with a few biscuits before having an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th March</span>
            We were up at about 7:30. We packed up all our dive gear and got a free transfer from the hotel to the bus station an hour later. We had almost an hour to wait for our the bus to Khao Lak so left our luggage at the ticket office and went for breakfast. The bus departed on time at 9:30 and the journey took just under four and a half hours. We thought we would have to get a taxi from Khao Lak bus station to where we are staying for the net two nights (Leaf on the Sands) but the bus dropped us in the centre of Khao Lak about 500m from the hotel. We walked to the hotel and checked in at exactly 14:00.
