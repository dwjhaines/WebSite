            Three days that were pretty much the same as the previous two. We moved to a different room on Monday as the one with a double bed became available but spent the days either on the terrace or on the local beach. The local beach can get too windy at times meaning that you do need to walk to the other one which is more sheltered. However, we have been lucky with the weather and it has been calm enough every day we have been here.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The evenings have also been the same. With the exception of Tuesday when Regan wasn't drinking due to morning sickness or something, we have all  done exactly the same thing every night - drinks on the terrace, a round in O&nbsp;Sophocles, a meal at Manolis before ending the night back at O&nbsp;Sophocles. Lipsi has been a very good place for eating and drinking. The food at Manolis has probably been the best we have had in Greece and O&nbsp;Sophocles an excellent place to drink
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 30th August</span>
            We left Lipsi today and also said goodbye to the others. Hoggy and Sarah are staying on Lipsi for a couple more days before flying home. We got the 10:00 ferry with Regan but he stayed on it when we got off as he is flying home tomorrow from Kos.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-090.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We got off the ferry at Leros which is only about 20 minutes from Lipsi. we got a taxi from the port to Tony's Beach Hotel at Vromolithos where we have a studio apartment booked for the next three nights. We were at the hotel by 11:00 but could not get into our room until 13:00 so had a couple of hours lying in the sun.  The hotel is in an excellent location, with sun loungers right above the beach so this was not too big a problem. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we did get into our room, it was one of the nicest we have had in Greece. It also has an excellent balcony with views of the sea and bits of the next village along at Panteli. We had lunch on the balcony before sleeping for an hour or so. There is not much in the way of shops or restaurants in Vromolithos so at 4ish, we walked about 1km to Panteli Beach to buy water, food for breakfast and to look at restaurants for tonight. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to Panteli to eat in the evening. There are plenty of restaurants there, right on the sea front around the harbour. We chose one where we could sit by the sea and had very good seafood again. First night in ages with no wine and we were back in the hotel by 22:00.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 31st August</span>
            We were up early this morning so after breakfast on the balcony, we started walking up to Panteli Castle. The castle is at about the highest point on the island and can just about be seen from our balcony. We walked back to Panteli Beach and found the road from there which leads up to the castle past a row of six windmills. The views from the road were good all the way up. We were able to see most of the towns/villages of the island, the port that we had come into yesterday and a lot of the other Dodecanese islands in the distance. The castle itself was reasonably interesting and was only €2 to get into so we did spend 30 minutes or so walking around inside. Once again though, the spectacular views were the high point.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back down into Panteli village via a set of steps. We had been looking for the steps to walk up but had been looking at the beach and not the village so were never going to find them. The village was also quite nice with a few bars and restaurants as well as a bigger supermarket than the one we had found yesterday. We stocked up on a few things and walked the mile or so back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After a few drinks on the balcony, we walked up the  hill to Dimitris Taverna. We had tried to book a table here yesterday but they were full so we booked for tonight instead. It was another excellent meal with good cheap retsina (€3 for half a litre) and superb views of the sea below. We booked a table for tomorrow night before walking back again. A few more drinks on the balcony and bed by about midnight.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st September</span>
            Had breakfast on the balcony and then spent an hour or so looking into options for later in the trip. We have planned what we are doing until about March next year but apart from a few ideas do not have anything planned after that. We will probably leave Asia, return home for a week or so before heading out to Mexico/Bonaire. Still did not really decide on anything but are starting to have a bit more of an idea.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">At 11:00 I walked up to the castle again. Probably not the best time of day to go but it was still another enjoyable walk. I was back at the hotel by 1:00 so spent an hour by the pool before lunch. Back to the pool after lunch and then up to the room for the football at 5:00. We followed the scores in the afternoon games and at 7:30 were able to watch Millwall v Swansea (an excellent game!!) on the balcony with a few glasses of wine. The internet connections in Greece have not been great but we had good enough Wi-Fi here to watch the whole game just about uninterrupted.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">As soon as the game finished, we walked back up the hill to Dimitris. We had an even better table than last night, probably one of the best we have ever had, and another very good meal. A couple of weeks ago, Roz said that she was starting to get bored of Greek food but since then, just about every meal has been excellent. We got through a few more bottles of retsina before walking back down to the hotel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd September</span>
            We had a few more hours by the pool before getting a taxi back to the port at Agia Marina at 1:45. We had tickets for The Dodeconesos Express back to Rhodes, a journey of four hours. We had lunch while we waited for the ferry which left just about on time at 2:30. This is the end of our traveling round Greek islands. Tomorrow, we fly back to Thessaloníki where we should be reunited with the car and will start heading back towards home.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived on time in Rhodes at 18:30 and walked back to the Moschos Hotel where we had stayed 13 nights ago. After showers we walked back out to the old town and went to eat at a restaurant recommended in Lonely Planet (Kostas Taverna). Nothing really wrong with the meal but no-where near as good or as cheap as the food that we have been eating in the last couple of weeks on the other islands. We were back in the hotel by 22:00.
