            We stayed in the room until check out at midday. After check-out, we left our stuff at the hotel and walked to the station to confirm the time of the train. The tickets said 2:24 but this is Moscow time meaning that it was really due to leave at 3:24 Samara time. We were fairly sure we knew the correct time but thought it a good idea to double check!

            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-051.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent 10 - 15 minutes walking round the station area and then another quarter of an hour or so walking round the football ground just up the road. Nothing too exciting to see. We returned to the hotel and spent an hour or so using their Wi-Fi. Their were quite a few people in there trying to book tickets for the semi-final. They do keep appearing on the FIFA web-site but it is a frustrating process trying to get hold of one of them. Demand is a lot higher for this game than the previous one so it is no-where near as easy to get hold of the tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">While sat here, we found out that Mark and Dave are both flying out for the semi-final (and possible final). Mark thinks he has managed to get a ticket through someone who is a friend of Steve Parish. Dave is coming out without a ticket and will try and get one out here. They are flying here separately - Mark gets here tomorrow, Dave sometime in the early hours of Wednesday. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the hotel just after two and had time at the station to get provisions for the journey. This will probably be our last Russian overnight train journey, just over 15 hours back to Moscow. The train was not quite as comfortable as the previous ones. It was a newer double decker train. Almost exactly the same as the older ones but without as much space on the upper bunk. This train was full and once again, we were sharing with a Russian couple. Uneventful journey and we were in our bunks by about 9:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 10th July</span>
            We arrived on time at 5:45 and got the Metro straight back to Sevastopalskaya for our fourth stay at the same hotel. We left our bags in reception and went for breakfast at the McDonalds just over the road. We got the metro back into town and spent another few hours sight-seeing. Roz had picked a few churches that we had not already seen and we spent most of the morning walking round them. We had another walk through Red Square and also visited Park Zaryadye. This was all a bit overgrown and not that interesting but there were good views from parts of it so still worth visiting.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got the Metro back to the hotel and checked in at midday. We checked in this time for three nights which takes us up to Friday when we are due to fly back to Skopje.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have much to do for the rest of the afternoon. Lunch in the room then a couple of hours sleep. Steve arrived back in Moscow at about 2:30 and was at the hotel by 5ish. Mark arrived at a similar time but is staying in central Moscow. We went back into the centre with Steve and Jer, who is also over for the semi-final, and returned to the craft beer pub we had been in before the Columbia game. We were joined by another of Steve's mates and eventually by Mark and we stayed in there for the France v Belgium game. Four of us returned to Sevastopolskaya when the game finished and went for a few more beers in ToDaSyo.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 11th July - 21:00 Croatia v England</span>
            Dave (Paddy) had arrived in Moscow at about 4am and had gone to Mark's hotel. He had nowhere booked for tonight so after breakfast, we booked him a room at our hotel and walked out to the Metro station to meet him and get him checked in. We met up with him again in reception just before 1:00 and headed into Moscow for the day. Steve and the rest of his lot had gone in ahead of us.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">The three of us got the Metro to the station where Free Lions were being given out and then walked a couple of miles back to Arbat. We had planned to go to the same craft beer pub we had been in before but Mark had spotted another one ("Erik the Red") about 5 minutes away and we had arranged to meet there at 2:30 instead. This was probably a better pub. There was a lot of coming and going through the afternoon. Steve turned up at about 4 but then Dave and one of Steve's mates had to go back to a hotel near Red Square to collect their tickets. Mark got stuck at a lunch somewhere while waiting for Steve Parish to turn up with his tickets. This went on for longer than expected so he did not arrive until 4:30. He was still without a ticket although his mate appeared about an hour later with it. A few other people joined us and it was an enjoyable afternoon despite the fact that we were all starting to get nervous.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We all left for the ground at about 6:30. We managed to lose most of the group on the Metro somewhere but Roz and I together with Mark and Paddy were all there about an hour later. Getting in was very easy again and we had time for a beer before Mark and Paddy headed off to their Cat 1 seats. Roz and I were in the England section again and met up with Steve at our seats.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-053.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">No need to say too much about the game! England had the chances to win the game in the first half and did not take them. From half-time onwards we were second best and were deservedly beaten. The atmosphere in the England end was not as good as it had been in previous games. A lot more people had come out for this game and it did not seem to have a positive effect. Everyone seemed more nervous, there was not as much singing and a lot more idiots who seem to think it is a good idea to throw beer over everyone had managed to get out here. Still a very exciting game but not the outcome we had hoped for. We stayed around to see the players applaud the fans after the final whistle but I was keen to get away from the ground so we did not stay long. I had no desire to stay in the ground watching the Croatians celebrate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya and went back to ToDaSyo to drown our sorrows. Paddy joined us about 10 minutes later and Steve, who we had left in the ground, arrived with his lot shortly after that. We had quite an enjoyable couple of hours in there despite the result and got back to the hotel just before 4am.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 12th July</span>
            Woke up at about 8:00 with that horrible feeling that always comes after getting knocked out of a tournament. England have done better than expected by reaching the semi-finals and the tournament itself has been superb but it is impossible not to keep thinking about how close they had come to getting into the final and wondering when they will next have a chance as good as they did yesterday. So many good chances to make it 2 - 0 and if they had just taken one of them.........
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">On a more positive note, when we had booked our flights to Moscow, we had booked to leave this Friday. We had expected to have to change this if England got knocked out early and would have booked another flight if they had made the final. However, the hotel is booked for tonight and flights booked for tomorrow so apart from a couple of cancellations for the weekend, we did not have a lot to do today. Most of the others we have been with are having to try and find flights home which is not that easy to do today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Paddy moved to a twin room at midday and we collected Mark from the Metro station at 1:00. Although we did not have to do anything with our flights, we then seemed to spend the rest of the afternoon sorting out flights for other people. Mark and Paddy came down to our room as neither of them had anything booked. Neither of them have a laptop and Paddy is not capable of booking anything himself anyway! I booked him a flight back to Dublin via Moldova while Roz sorted out Mark's flight back to Gatwick via Pisa. We were then heading out for the evening when we met Sheila in reception. One of her bookings had been canceled and Roz spent about an hour with her while she booked one replacement flight and changed another. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-054.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Eventually, six of us left the hotel just before 5:00. We got the Metro to the nearest stop to Red Square. Although we had been there a few times already, Mark had not been there on this trip and Paddy had not been there at all. We walked through the square again, adding to our collection of photos of St. Basil's Cathedral. We crossed the river and walked along the side opposite the Kremlin by which time we were about a mile away from Arbat again. We continued walking back to Arbat and by about 19:00, were back at Erik the Red. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This turned into an excellent night out. We ate in Erik the Red and had quite a few beers before getting the Metro back to Sevastopolskaya. Steve and Sheila went back to the hotel but Mark, Paddy, Roz and I carried on drinking at ToDaSyo. We had a few more beers and a couple of vodkas each. Once again, it was daylight by the time we left. ToDaSyo could not really be described as a bar, a restaurant or a night club. There is nothing quite like it at home but it was a bit of all three and was a slightly strange place. However, it had just about become our local since we first arrived in Moscow and it was sad to be leaving it for the final time. A good way to end our stay in Russia.
