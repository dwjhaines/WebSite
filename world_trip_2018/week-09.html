            We checked out of the apartment at midday and then spent an hour or so lying by the pool before driving into Ohrid to our next apartment. This one was right in the centre and was a bit trickier to get to due to the one-way system. It also has a very small car park which took a bit of effort to get into but by about 2:00 we were checked in. This apartment is not quite as nice as the previous one and the view is not as good but it is cheaper, in a better location for shops and restaurants and the balcony is much bigger. We were expecting to need a rest and a break from traveling after getting back from Russia so had booked to stay here for five nights.

            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We both fell asleep after lunch and the planned bike ride did not happen. We went for a walk along the lake in the evening and bought more stuff to cook in the apartment. We cooked tea again and ate it sat on the balcony watching the sun setting over a half built hotel.
