            We checked out of the apartment at midday and then spent an hour or so lying by the pool before driving into Ohrid to our next apartment. This one was right in the centre and was a bit trickier to get to due to the one-way system. It also has a very small car park which took a bit of effort to get into but by about 2:00 we were checked in. This apartment is not quite as nice as the previous one and the view is not as good but it is cheaper, in a better location for shops and restaurants and the balcony is much bigger. We were expecting to need a rest and a break from traveling after getting back from Russia so had booked to stay here for five nights.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We both fell asleep after lunch and the planned bike ride did not happen. We went for a walk along the lake in the evening and bought more stuff to cook in the apartment. We cooked tea again and ate it sat on the balcony watching the sun setting over a half built hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 17th July</span>
            We both had a bit more energy today so were able to go out on our bikes after breakfast. We headed South along the lake from Ohrid. The bike path was fine for the first couple of miles but then ended meaning a lot of the cycling was along a busy road. We turned round after a few miles and went North instead. Still not much in the way of cycle paths but the roads were a lot quieter. We will go further in this direction tomorrow. We did about 18 miles in total and were back at the apartment for lunch.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-057.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">A similar afternoon to yesterday. We managed to get a few places booked for when we leave here. We did not have anything booked between when we leave Ohrid on 2nd August. We have to be out of Macedonia by 24th July (the date that the Macedonian car insurance runs out) so booked three more nights further South and also somewhere for our first night in Greece.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were going to go out for a walk again at about 4:30. We got about 200m before a heavy rain shower made us turn round. We waited about an hour for it to clear and had another attempt. We went a bit further than yesterday and made it as far as Church of Sveti Jovan, a small church set on a cliff overlooking the lake which is apparently "Macedonia's most photographed structure". We walked back from there through the old town, full of cobbled streets, small churches and traditional restaurants. It is all quite nice and the rain had put a lot of people off so there were relatively few tourists around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the fourth night in a row we cooked our own evening meal and ate on our balcony.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 18th July</span>
            Another morning spent out on our bikes. We went directly North this time and cycled to Struga, the second biggest town on the lake about 10 miles away. We continued on the lake path for a couple of miles more until it ended a few miles short of the Albanian border (only half of the lake is in Macedonia, the other half is Albanian). It was quite a nice ride, passing a few small beaches along the side of the lake as we went. It was more scenic and less busy up here than when we had gone South yesterday. We did a total of just under 25 miles.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-058.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Another similar afternoon. There are still quite a few bits of the next couple of months where we do not really know what we are doing so we spent some more time planning and looking into options. We had planned to go to Spain for England's friendly in October but have almost totally ruled that out due to the limited time we have at home. We have definitely ruled out the game in Croatia a few days before that which is being played behind closed doors anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For our evening walk we went past yesterdays church and onto Saint Pantelejmon, another Eastern Orthodox Church on top of the cliff which was probably more spectacular than the yesterday's. It was just a bit of a shame about the amount of building work going on all around it. Once again, it was a nice walk back through the streets of the old town to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the first time since getting back to Macedonia, we went out to eat in the evening. We walked back into the old town and ate at a pizza restaurant overlooking the Sveta Sofija Cathedral. The most expensive places to eat here are all on the lake but there are some really nice restaurants in the old town which are more reasonably priced and with very good views. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 19th July</span>
            A similar bike ride to yesterday's to start the day. We cycled the same route North to Struga but instead of continuing round the lake, we went inland a bit and followed the main road up towards the Albanian border.... with "up" being the operative word! The border crossing is at Qafë Thanë which is a mountain pass. We got a few miles up the road but gave up before we reached the border and cycled back to Ohrid. A round trip of 31 miles.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The place we are staying (Tedi and Kiki's Apartments) is owned/managed by three generations of the same family with the grandson being the only one fluent in English. We had spoken to him last night about the car battery and when we got back from our bike ride, he said his father would come with me to somewhere they would be able to look at it for me. I drove with him to what appeared to be a bike repair shop that also sold car batteries.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-059.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The mechanic there attached some sort of tester to the battery and ran a test that came back with "Bad - Replace". There was much shaking of the head and tutting as he discovered that the battery was eight years old but they were able to replace it in about 10 minutes. It cost MKD4000, about £58, which did not seem too bad. It was good to have it sorted out as we will be leaving the car in Greece a couple of times for periods of up two weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the time we had sorted this out and eaten our leftover pizza for lunch it was about 3pm. We went for a walk round the area near the apartment but did not do much else for the rest of the afternoon, although we did start planing our route home from Greece in September
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had not had any alcohol since getting back into Macedonia but we were feeling sufficiently well again to have have a few drinks tonight. We had a few glasses of wine on the balcony and then went to a restaurant that we had seen when we had been for our walk earlier. This was more of a Taverna type place and being outside of the old town was a lot cheaper. The cheapest wine on the wine list was about £9 but Roz showed the waiter a picture of the wine we had been drinking in Skopje and he managed to produce the same wine at just over £3 a litre. We stayed there quite a while and got through two bottles before going back for another drink on the balcony.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 20th July</span>
            A bit of a later start today due to the late night yesterday. We went out on our bikes at about 11:00 and went out in the same direction as yesterday. After about 12 miles, as the road started climbing, Roz turned off and went to lie on a beach by the lake. I kept going up the hill and this time made it all the way to the border. I had to push the bike up one particularly steep part and the six mile ascent took me just over 50 minutes. It was hotter today than it has been all week and the amount of wine we had got through last night did not help but I did make it to the top. It only took about 10 minutes to get through the two sets of border controls but disappointingly, I did not get my passport stamped. Getting an Albanian stamp in my passport was one of the main reasons for cycling up the hill.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Once into Albania, I cycled another mile or so to get to the good views of the lake. I wanted to go further to look for one of the concrete bunkers that are all over the country but the road was literally going rapidly downhill and I did not think I would be able to get back up it again if I went too much further! After about half an hour in Albania, I recrossed the border and had a somewhat easier ride back down to the lake to meet Roz. I just about completed the 12 miles back again and we were back at the apartment by about 4:00. We both fell asleep after a late lunch again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to the same restaurant as last night to eat. A similar evening again but with less wine!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 21st July</span>
            We got up, had breakfast and loaded up the car by check-out time at 10:00. The five days here had gone incredibly quickly and it has been an excellent place to stay. We said our goodbyes to the owners who have been part of the reason it has been so good to stay here. They could not have been more friendly and were particularly helpful in getting the car fixed. Quite sad to be leaving again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After a quick supermarket stop, we headed South along the lake. We have three more days before we have to leave Macedonia and decided we may as well stay here as long as possible as it is a lot cheaper than Greece. We had booked another apartment in a small village on a hill overlooking the lake a couple of miles from another Albanian border crossing. We arrived at the apartment at 11:00 and were able to check in straight away. This apartment had the best view of any of the three we have stayed in at the lake but has no balcony which was a pity as the only way to see the view was to stand at the window.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-061.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">At about 3:00, we went out on our bikes again. At St Naum, which is right on the border, there is a monastery which is another of the lake's main sights. It is only two miles from where we are staying and a very easy cycle ride as it is all downhill. We spent about 30 minutes looking round the monastery, both inside and out. The inside was quite ornate with lots of paintings on the walls and although we do not usually pay to go into a lot of places, this was worth seeing. The outside was also good in a nice garden with lots of peacocks wandering around. There is a small beach either side of the monastery so we spent an hour or so lying in the sun before cycling/walking back up the hill to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This apartment was nowhere near as well equipped as the last two so cooking was a bit more of a challenge but we managed to make our usual evening meal of kebabs and salad and ate it on the terrace outside one of the other rooms.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 22nd July</span>
            We had breakfast included in the price of this apartment but the breakfast was served in a restaurant two miles away near the monastery. The family who own the apartment also own the restaurant so this makes it easier for them. Not ideal but we knew this in advance and it did not really matter today. We left the apartment on our bikes just before 9:00 and headed down to the restaurant. After about quarter of a mile, I realised we had not bought our passports which would be needed later so had to go back up the steepest part of the journey to collect them.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Breakfast was pretty good and the location was excellent. The restaurant was set over a smaller inland lake near the springs that supply the main lake. All very pleasant with the added bonus of tortoises "running" around to keep Roz entertained.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-062.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After breakfast, we went back up to the main road and continued cycling round the lake and into Albania. The border crossing was straight forward again and Roz managed to get the border police to stamp our passports this time. The road round the lake was a lot less hilly at this end and once into Albania, it was almost totally flat. We cycled about 7 or 8 miles around the lake passing a few small beaches, one large resort town....... and lots of concrete bunkers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The bunkers were built during the communist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s. Hoxha, as well as being completely mad,  was totally paranoid about Albania being invaded by foreign powers so built over 173,000 concrete bunkers to protect the country. They were built out of reinforced concrete and are just about indestructible so most of them can still be seen wherever you go in Albania. We had seen them before when traveling through the country by bus but had not had the chance to see them close up as we could today. We were able to get close for photos, climb on them and get inside one of them. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When we had finished playing with the bunkers, we recrossed the border and returned to the beach at St Naum where we had been yesterday afternoon. We stayed there for an hour or so before returning to the apartment for a late lunch. Another quiet afternoon without much to do.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Tonight was our ninth and final night at Lake Ohrid. We are no-where near any restaurants so cooked and ate in the apartment again. This has been a strange apartment. It could be superb but we have kept having to ask for things like cooking utensils, washing up things, chairs to go with the table, all things which have been provided automatically in other apartments we have stayed in. They have been very quick to bring things when we have asked but it would have been nice if we had not needed to ask. Anyway, now we finally have everything we need, it was another meal of the spicy kebabs, bread and salad. This is just about the national dish of Macedonia and has been a cheap, tasty and easy to prepare meal that we have now cooked six of the last nine nights. We had this for a final time while looking at the lake and drinking another litre of wine. 
            </p>
