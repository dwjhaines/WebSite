            The last day of diving for us in The Philippines today. We did the two morning boat dives again. We were back with Raymond and had Daniel and Tao (a typical Chinese diver!) in our group. The first dive was the Eastern side of Pescador Island. We had not dived that side on this visit. Another nice wall with plenty of fish, one of the biggest nudibranchs we have ever seen and a couple of turtles at the end. The second dive was at White Beach. This was probably the worst dive we have done since getting here. The site was not as spectacular as most of the walls here, a lot of the site was covered in sand and there was not too much to see in the way of marine life either. All a bit disappointing.

            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit unsure about whether or not to do the afternoon boat dive but eventually decided to repeat the dive we did on our own on the house reef yesterday. This was excellent again. We swam into the current to get to the sardines. We could only spend about five minutes with them by the time we got there but it was still good to have a final look at them and we had an easy drift back to the resort. Not quite as many turtles today but we still saw eleven including five right at the end. The last one was a large hawksbill that we think we have seen a few times now. A nice way to finish our diving here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent our last evening in Moalboal drinking too much rum on the balcony while looking at photos and videos from the last few weeks. We had a couple of drinks before going out to eat at The Last Filling Station again and then continued drinking when we got back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 22nd January</span>
            We checked out of the room and paid our bill just after 11:00. We had been unsure about returning to Moalboal but it has been brilliant again and we could easily have stayed longer. It has not changed that much since we were here last and the diving has been better than anywhere else we have been so far in The Philippines. Sad to be leaving again!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had considered staying somewhere else in Moalboal for one night but changed our minds as it was not worth the hassle of moving elsewhere for one night. Instead we headed back to Cebu City. Again, we thought the cost of the transfer was too high so we were back on public transport. We got a tricycle from outside reception back to the bus station in Moalboal and then straight onto an air-conditioned bus to Cebu City. The journey took about three hours and we were dropped at the Southern bus station. We got a taxi after queuing for a few minutes and by 16:00 were back in the Tsai Hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both hungry by this time as we had not had lunch so went straight over the road for a burger from McDonalds. In the evening we went back to the pizza place at Mango Mall.

            We did not have a lot to do today but wanted to visit a couple of dive shops. We got a taxi first out to Asia Divers. They supply Quo Vardis in Moalboal and we knew that they had the wet-suit that Roz wanted (hers has big holes in it). We got a couple of replacement mouth-pieces for Roz's regs while we were there but did not buy another dive bag. They did have an ideal bag but it would have cost about Â£350 which was quite a bit more than we wanted to pay. We got another taxi from there to Aquamundo to look at their selection of bags. They are cheaper as all their gear is Philippine made but they did not have anything suitable.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got another taxi back to near the hotel and went for lunch in the shopping centre before returning to the room for the rest of the afternoon. Did not do a lot apart from patching up the dive bag again with yet more cable ties. It really does need replacing now!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at the not-so-scenic pizza restaurant in the evening while having our final session on the local rum. The food and drink here have been excellent. We have had a lot of pizzas but will probably not have any for the rest of our time in Asia. It is also time for a couple of weeks off alcohol!

            Apart from me going out for a haircut, we stayed in the room until we checked out at 11:30. We got a taxi to the airport and checked in for our Air Asia flight to KL. Check-in did not go well. We had booked flights from Cebu to Krabi via KL but had decided not to use the second flight and just go as far as KL. We have changed our plans since the flights were booked and are going back to Indonesia instead of Thailand. We had assumed that this would not be an issue as the flight to Krabi is not until tomorrow morning and we thought that we would be able to collect our luggage in KL and just not turn up for the second flight. However, at check-in, they insisted on checking in our luggage all the way to Krabi. No amount of arguing would persuade them not to do this although we were told that we would still have the option of collecting our luggage in KL.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There was not a lot we could do about this so gave up and went through to departures. We  had lunch at Burger King and boarded the 13:50 flight which left about 30 minutes late.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived at KLIA2 at about 6:30 and got through immigration relatively quickly. There were still very long queues to get through but for once we chose the fastest moving queue and we were through in about 15 minutes. We had been told in Cebu that our luggage would be on the baggage carousel when we got to KL. This always seemed unlikely and there was no sign of it when we got there.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-200.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We waited a few minutes before Roz went to the Air Asia baggage office and asked if we could get our bags. The bloke in here could not have been more helpful. He said we could have our bags but it would take an hour to get them. We were expecting a lot more arguing and awkward questions about our onward flight so this was a good result for us. I waited outside the office while Roz went and checked into the Tune Hotel for the second time on this trip. It took almost exactly an hour but by 8pm, I had collected both of our bags and had met Roz in the arrivals area. I took the bags to the hotel while she stayed in the shopping centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I dropped the bags in the room and went back to meet Roz again, this time at the Indian restaurant we had eaten at in October. We had roti canai for the first time in a while and then went back into the shopping centre. The dive bag really does need replacing now. We found a luggage shop and bought an orange suitcase that is just about the same size. Not an ideal replacement but the dive bag was not going to last much longer before falling apart completely so it needed to be done. We wheeled the suitcase back to the hotel and were in bed just after 10.
