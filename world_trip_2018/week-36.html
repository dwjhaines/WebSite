            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 21st January</span>
            The last day of diving for us in The Philippines today. We did the two morning boat dives again. We were back with Raymond and had Daniel and Tao (a typical Chinese diver!) in our group. The first dive was the Eastern side of Pescador Island. We had not dived that side on this visit. Another nice wall with plenty of fish, one of the biggest nudibranchs we have ever seen and a couple of turtles at the end. The second dive was at White Beach. This was probably the worst dive we have done since getting here. The site was not as spectacular as most of the walls here, a lot of the site was covered in sand and there was not too much to see in the way of marine life either. All a bit disappointing.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-198.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit unsure about whether or not to do the afternoon boat dive but eventually decided to repeat the dive we did on our own on the house reef yesterday. This was excellent again. We swam into the current to get to the sardines. We could only spend about five minutes with them by the time we got there but it was still good to have a final look at them and we had an easy drift back to the resort. Not quite as many turtles today but we still saw eleven including five right at the end. The last one was a large hawksbill that we think we have seen a few times now. A nice way to finish our diving here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent our last evening in Moalboal drinking too much rum on the balcony while looking at photos and videos from the last few weeks. We had a couple of drinks before going out to eat at The Last Filling Station again and then continued drinking when we got back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 22nd January</span>
            We checked out of the room and paid our bill just after 11:00. We had been unsure about returning to Moalboal but it has been brilliant again and we could easily have stayed longer. It has not changed that much since we were here last and the diving has been better than anywhere else we have been so far in The Philippines. Sad to be leaving again!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had considered staying somewhere else in Moalboal for one night but changed our minds as it was not worth the hassle of moving elsewhere for one night. Instead we headed back to Cebu City. Again, we thought the cost of the transfer was too high so we were back on public transport. We got a tricycle from outside reception back to the bus station in Moalboal and then straight onto an air-conditioned bus to Cebu City. The journey took about three hours and we were dropped at the Southern bus station. We got a taxi after queuing for a few minutes and by 16:00 were back in the Tsai Hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both hungry by this time as we had not had lunch so went straight over the road for a burger from McDonalds. In the evening we went back to the pizza place at Mango Mall.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 23rd January</span>
            We did not have a lot to do today but wanted to visit a couple of dive shops. We got a taxi first out to Asia Divers. They supply Quo Vardis in Moalboal and we knew that they had the wet-suit that Roz wanted (hers has big holes in it). We got a couple of replacement mouth-pieces for Roz's regs while we were there but did not buy another dive bag. They did have an ideal bag but it would have cost about £350 which was quite a bit more than we wanted to pay. We got another taxi from there to Aquamundo to look at their selection of bags. They are cheaper as all their gear is Philippine made but they did not have anything suitable.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got another taxi back to near the hotel and went for lunch in the shopping centre before returning to the room for the rest of the afternoon. Did not do a lot apart from patching up the dive bag again with yet more cable ties. It really does need replacing now!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate out at the not-so-scenic pizza restaurant in the evening while having our final session on the local rum. The food and drink here have been excellent. We have had a lot of pizzas but will probably not have any for the rest of our time in Asia. It is also time for a couple of weeks off alcohol!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 24th January</span>
            Apart from me going out for a haircut, we stayed in the room until we checked out at 11:30. We got a taxi to the airport and checked in for our Air Asia flight to KL. Check-in did not go well. We had booked flights from Cebu to Krabi via KL but had decided not to use the second flight and just go as far as KL. We have changed our plans since the flights were booked and are going back to Indonesia instead of Thailand. We had assumed that this would not be an issue as the flight to Krabi is not until tomorrow morning and we thought that we would be able to collect our luggage in KL and just not turn up for the second flight. However, at check-in, they insisted on checking in our luggage all the way to Krabi. No amount of arguing would persuade them not to do this although we were told that we would still have the option of collecting our luggage in KL.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There was not a lot we could do about this so gave up and went through to departures. We  had lunch at Burger King and boarded the 13:50 flight which left about 30 minutes late.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived at KLIA2 at about 6:30 and got through immigration relatively quickly. There were still very long queues to get through but for once we chose the fastest moving queue and we were through in about 15 minutes. We had been told in Cebu that our luggage would be on the baggage carousel when we got to KL. This always seemed unlikely and there was no sign of it when we got there.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-200.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We waited a few minutes before Roz went to the Air Asia baggage office and asked if we could get our bags. The bloke in here could not have been more helpful. He said we could have our bags but it would take an hour to get them. We were expecting a lot more arguing and awkward questions about our onward flight so this was a good result for us. I waited outside the office while Roz went and checked into the Tune Hotel for the second time on this trip. It took almost exactly an hour but by 8pm, I had collected both of our bags and had met Roz in the arrivals area. I took the bags to the hotel while she stayed in the shopping centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I dropped the bags in the room and went back to meet Roz again, this time at the Indian restaurant we had eaten at in October. We had roti canai for the first time in a while and then went back into the shopping centre. The dive bag really does need replacing now. We found a luggage shop and bought an orange suitcase that is just about the same size. Not an ideal replacement but the dive bag was not going to last much longer before falling apart completely so it needed to be done. We wheeled the suitcase back to the hotel and were in bed just after 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 25th January</span>
            We were up by 5:00, checked out of the hotel (leaving my dive bag in the room - a sad moment) and walked across to KLIA2. The curry house at the terminal is open 24 hours a day so we were able to get our roti canai for breakfast before getting the free shuttle bus round to KLIA. We were at KLIA by 6:00 and checked in for our Silk Air flights to Manado via Singapore. There was more potential for losing our luggage today as we only had a 50 minute stop-over in Singapore. However, at least today the bags were checked in to the same place that we wanted to fly to which was an improvement on yesterday.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-201.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The flight left on time and we arrived in Singapore at 8:30. We had a bit of a trek through Changi but got to our gate with plenty of time for the 9:20 flight to Manado. This also left on time and we thought we saw my case being loaded onto the plane which was good news. The plane was only half full which was also good news as we had three seats between us so the three hour, twenty minute flight was quite comfortable. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got to Manado at 1ish, got straight through immigration and were relieved to see that both of our bags had made it. We were met outside the airport by a driver from Lembeh Dive Lodge. He waited while I took money out of the ATM and put credit on my Indonesian SIM (Roz's seems to have been disconnected). It was a one hour drive to Bitung where there should have been a boat waiting for us. Instead, we had a wait of 10 - 15 minutes for the boat and then a 15 minute journey across Lembeh straight to the dive resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive resort is a few rooms built on a hill with views of the Lembeh Straight and/or the lagoon on the other side of the hill. We unpacked our dive gear at the bottom of the hill and the rest of the luggage was carried up for us. We were given welcome drinks in the restaurant which is about a third of the way up the hill and then shown to our room. Our room is the highest one with excellent views of the lagoon and we can also just about see Lembeh Straight. It was cheaper than similar rooms further down the hill but has the longest walk up from the restaurant/beach. There is no air-con in the room but given its height, it should be cool enough. We spent what was left of the afternoon unpacking and sorting our stuff out for diving tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went down to the restaurant at 7pm for dinner. As with our previous stay in Lembeh, food is served to everyone at one big communal table. There are about eight to ten other people staying here and they seem to be mainly Dutch and mainly older than us. The food was very good but it was not a late night. Most people left when they had finished eating and we were back at the room by 8 and asleep by about 9.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 26th January</span>
            Lembeh is one of the best, if not the best, areas for muck diving in the world. Muck diving means that instead of diving over nice colourful reefs looking for turtles and lots of fish, you are diving over black sand and rubble, quite often in places where there is a lot of rubbish in the water, looking for rare, odd creatures. Because of the type of diving the groups are very small (maximum two divers per guide) and there are not many divers on each of the boats. Today it was just four of us which I think is pretty normal. Our guide for today and probably the rest of the week was Rinto.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-202.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first two dives today were excellent examples of muck diving. The first was at Monument, near a pier with plenty of rubbish in the water. We immediately saw three tiny yellow box fish in the first few metres. Also saw a Pegasus sea moth, a tiny juvenile starry puffer fish and a couple of flamboyant cuttle fish. We saw a small one diving in Mabul but one of the ones here I could only just see. The only way I knew what it was was by taking a photo and enlarging it. There were a few mandarin fish around at the end of the dive as well. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Jahir. We were specifically looking for hairy frog-fish here and were able to find two. One of them as a small dark coloured one that you could only just tell was a frog-fish. The second was bigger and an excellent specimen. There were several Ambon scorpion fish around and we also saw a coconut octopus which I don't think we have seen before. On top of all this we were shown a "Shaun the Sheep nudibranch" which we have certainly not seen before and I briefly saw a guitar shark. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz had complained about the dive time after the first dive as there is not supposed to be a maximum dive time and we were taken back to the boat after 70 minutes. The second dive lasted 83 minutes so it looks as if that is no longer an issue. We were also pleased to find that the water temperature is back up to 28°c. Although only one degree warmer than in The Philippines, this makes a huge difference.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">When photographing the second hairy frog-fish, we both ran out of bottom time and went into deco. Not the end of the world but not ideal on our first day of diving here. We had not anticipated the dives being as deep as the first two had been so had not bothered using Nitrox. We will change tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort for lunch and then Roz and I did an unguided dive on the house reef. There was not as much to see here (although that may be because we did not have a guide) but there were a few decent nudis and it was an enjoyable enough dive. Had a similar evening to last night apart from the fact that there were less people eating (the Belgian has left and the Hungarians were night diving). Back in the room before 8pm again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 27th January</span>
            Two more very good muck dives today. We were the only customers on the boat as Fred and Betty, the Dutch couple who were on the boat yesterday and who must be 10 - 15 years older than us, only dive every other day. The dive sites today were Batu Lubang Besar and Teluk Kembahu III. The first did have some quite spectacular coral in the first 15m while the second was purely over the black sand.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">On the first dive, we were looking for blue-ring octopus, something I am keen on seeing. We did not find the blue-ring but did find a small red octopus that was forcibly removed from the bottle that it was quite happily living in with a pokey stick. Roz found an ornate ghost pipe-fish and we were also shown a velvet ghost pipe-fish, another first. Two frog-fish on this dive - one white warty frog-fish and an excellent giant frog-fish up on the reef.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-203.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The highlight of the second dive was once again a hairy frog-fish. This one was in between the size of the two we saw yesterday and was happily walking across the sand. It was shallower than yesterdays and we were on nitrox anyway so could spend more time watching it. There were two incredibly small yellow box fish, a couple of mantis shrimps, flying gurnards, a fingered dragonet, three robust ghost pipe-fish and a small cuttle fish. Both dives featured a range of nudibranchs and strange looking scorpion fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a choppier than usual journey back to the resort. Because of the wind direction and the size of the waves, we were advised that it was probably not a good idea to dive the house reef again this afternoon so for the first time in a while, we had an afternoon where we were not diving, traveling or hungover. Had an enjoyable  afternoon editing photos from the last couple of days and not really doing a lot else.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Another early night. Everyone seems to be back in their rooms by 8pm as soon as dinner is finished.
