            We were up at 5:15 again this morning for an early dive on Bari Reef. This did not start well as I discovered that my torch battery was flat after I had got in the water. It is just starting to get light at this time so not the end of the world but not ideal for the first 10 - 15 minutes either. We went South again from the entry point and again it was an enjoyable start to the day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After this dive, I went and got my high pressure hose replaced. It has been leaking for a few days but I was hoping it would last until we got home but this morning the leak seemed worse. It was still just about usable but had it got worse again, it could have caused problems. They had one hose left at the dive centre and it took about 15 minutes to swap them round. We were on our way to for our next dive by about 8:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit unsure about where to do the next two dives but were keen to head for Kapata again. This time instead of going straight there, we stopped to dive 1000 Steps on the way. Normal service was resumed here and Roz counted four green turtles although I only saw three of them. As this dive was good and the sea still seemed quite rough we decided to do a second dive here and miss out on Kapata. Entry/Exit is a lot easier at 1000 Steps. For the second dive here, we went South but then continued into the Northern shallow area to end the dive. One more green turtle on what was our last dive here for this trip.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-288.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a bit more time back in the apartment this afternoon as we were back slightly earlier. At about 4:30 we headed out again and did a repeat of yesterday's dive at Something Special. The start of this dive was excellent as we had a 25 minute encounter with an octopus. We have not seen too many of these on this visit to Bonaire and this is the first one that has stayed out and let us watch it for any time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We then decided to swim quickly to the area where we have twice seen the green turtle. This proved to be a bad move as we could not find the turtle and when we were at about the furthest point from where we entered, the current picked up quite dramatically. There is never much current here but it is just after the full moon and this is just about the strongest we have ever encountered. It was still possible to swim into it but it was hard work and a relief to get back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in the apartment by 7ish. After showers we had a few drinks while doing log books, then had the other halves of the pizzas we had bought last night. We had a few more drinks while looking at the days photos and got to bed just after 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st May</span>
            Another 5:15 start and another early morning dive on Bari Reef. After the strong current yesterday we decided to be sensible and check the current before choosing which direction to go in. There was no current at all when we went in so we headed South, which was the way we both wanted to go. We made it to the rubble area and it had been an easy dive up until about the 50th minute. As we were starting to think about heading back, the current quickly picked up to about the same strength as it had been yesterday evening. This meant a not so relaxing swim back with me ending the dive on 20 bar.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-289.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had breakfast on the balcony before heading South for the next two dives. We dived the outer reef at Aquarius which was OK without being too spectacular. We headed North when we got to the outer reef and the top of the reef was at about 24m for most of the way which is a bit deeper than we would have hoped for. All nice enough but not a great dive. We continued from there to Salt Pier where we had another very good dive. Plenty of time with the turtles again and plenty of fish all over the pier. No sign of the frog-fish but we had been expecting them to have gone after Sunday's activity.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All of the dives were slightly shorter this morning due to the current on the first, the depth of the second and Roz starting with 180 bar on the third. This did mean that we were back for lunch slightly earlier than usual and had a couple of hours in the apartment before the fourth dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to dive from The Cliff back to Bari Reef for the fourth dive but because the current has been unpredictable for the last 24 hours we decided to stick with a final dive on Bari Reef. We had seen that a frog fish had been spotted on the reef and were given pretty good directions where to find it. The current was stronger than usual but not too bad and we could swim into it without any problems. We found the frog-fish in the area where we used to see the turtles. Not in the best of positions for being photographed but good to see anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in the apartment by 7:00 and had a. few drinks on the balcony again while doing log books and looking at photos

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd May</span>
            Today was our last day of diving in Bonaire and almost certainly our last day of diving for this trip. We Always choose our favourite sites for diving on the last day and this year, for the first time, that involved just diving the Southern sites. We started at Angel City just before 7:00, swam over to the second reef and along to the anchor chains of the Hilma Hooker. We crossed back over to the wreck and had twenty minutes or so on it with no other divers again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive, we returned to Vista Blue. This was a bit of a gamble as it is not really one of our favourite sites but we have had very good turtle encounters on the previous two dives here. The current was quite strong today which was not ideal but it was not as bad as a couple of days ago and was a nice enough dive. We did not see any turtles this time but I did find another frog-fish which was an unexpected bonus.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-290.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive and the last dive of the trip was at Salt Pier. I said when we left Asia that it is always good to end a dive trip on a high. We did not manage that when we left Mabul as the last days diving there was poor but this was a superb dive to finish on. The water in the shallows was calmer today meaning that the vis was better. We had about 20 - 25 minutes in the shallows with the turtles before moving onto the pier.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Almost as soon as we got to the Northernmost structure, we spotted Salt Pier Turtle. When we have seen him in the past, he has mainly stayed in one spot eating. Today could not have been better as he spent about 25 minutes swimming the length of the dive site down to the Southern end with the occasional stop on the way. Just after he got to the last part of the pier, he went up for air and disappeared, ideal timing for us to head back through the structures, back to the Northern end.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz managed to find the original (we think) frog-fish again as we swam past the area she was in before. She was sat in the same place as she was before all of Sunday's activities. We left the pier when I was down to 60 bar and returned to the shallows for a final look at the turtles. The area we went back through was as turtley as it had been on any of our dives here. We found three in about 2m which we stayed with until I was down to 30 bar. We headed for the exit point and just as we were about to surface, saw another four smaller turtles. The perfect way to end our diving here. It also added a minute to our longest dive record, this one being 125 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">That bought an end to our diving for this World trip. We have done 379 dives in eight different countries, spent 454 hours underwater and Roz has counted 1798 turtles!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had considered doing a fourth dive today but it made sense to finish earlier, get our stuff dry and give ourselves a bit more time between the last dive and our flight tomorrow. We drove back to Sand Dollar, washed all our gear and got it hanging up to dry before having yesterday's pizza leftovers for a late lunch. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Ending our diving earlier also gave us more time to enjoy our last evening here. We had a few drinks on the balcony just after 5pm before walking into Kralendijk. We stopped for one drink on the way but spent most of the evening back in the Bonaire Blond brewery. Most of the Chinese bars had closed by the time we left there but we did get one more drink on the way back and were back in the apartment sometime around midnight.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 23rd May</span>
            Did not do a lot for most of the day. We had to collect our diving voucher from the Sand Dollar office and go to the dive centre to check out but the rest of the day was spent sorting out the dive gear, packing and lying in the sun (Roz) or continuing to sort out photos (me).
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We checked out of the apartment at 4:30, returned the key to the office and said goodbye to Ilsa. We drove to the airport via Captain Don's so that Roz could buy more turtle jewelery and also had to drive via the petrol station to fill up before returning the truck. We dropped the truck back at the rental office and walked across to the airport to check in for the 19:05 KLM flight back to Amsterdam. By the time we were through immigration, we had less than an hour to wait. We boarded the plane just before 19:00 and it left on time for the nine hour flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few bottles of wine on the plane and did manage to get a few hours sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 24th May</span>
            We were woken at about 8am Dutch time and landed at Schipol on time by about 10:15. We were outside the airport with our luggage by about 11:00 and by 11:20 had been picked up and taken back to collect the car. We drove to the same supermarket that we had used three weeks ago (less than 50m from the car park) and then started heading South towards Germany.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have anywhere booked for tonight as we did not know how tired we would be and how far we would want to drive. As it was, we were not too bad and were able to do quite a lot of our journey towards Donauwörth where we are staying tomorrow. We crossed into Germany at about 1pm and stopped for petrol and to eat lunch. We continued driving through the mess of motorways around the Düsseldorf/Cologne region before deciding that we would stop at Glashütten, just West of Frankfurt. Roz phoned ahead and booked a room for tonight and we arrived at the Panorama Hotel at about 4:45. By this time we were totally worn out but the driving has been fine today and we will only have another three hours or so to go tomorrow.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-292.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had showers and sorted out some of our luggage and then went out to eat. Glashütten did not have a huge range of eating options. The first place we looked at round the corner from the hotel only had Croatian food on their menu, their was a bar that had no food, a place that looked good but only served pizza and pasta, and one expensive German restaurant. As we were both keen on German food, none of these was ideal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a beer in the pizza/pasta place while we considered what to do. This was a nice enough bar although the beer options were not great. We stopped for another beer at the bar without food which was not a great bar but did have better beer. We then returned to Bürgerklause, the Croatian restaurant which seemed about the best of the options.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This was a much better restaurant once we were inside than it had looked and had a much bigger menu than the one it displayed outside with a full range of German food. Food, beer and service was all excellent. We both had very good schnitzels and a few wheat beers before returning to the room just after 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th May</span>
            WE checked out of the hotel just after 9:00 and continued our journey towards Donauwörth. We stopped at a supermarket after about 10 minutes and then stopped again at a picnic area to eat breakfast. The journey took a bit longer than expected. There was a lot of traffic around Frankfurt and a lot of roadworks for most of the journey. Despite all this, we arrived at our hotel in Asbach-Bäumenheim, about 6km South of Donauwörth, by about 2pm.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have booked an apartment here for four nights. It is a bit out of the way for bars and restaurants but it was a lot cheaper than staying in Donauwörth, it is close to the motorway and has easy parking. It is also not badly placed as a base for a few days of cycling and relative healthiness before next weekend in Munich.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-293.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent most of the next hour getting everything in from the car and sorting out the things that we will not need for the rest of the trip so the boot can be a bit more organised. We went out on our bikes at 3:00. We had a look around the centre of Asbach-Bäumenheim which is about a mile away. Not too much here of any interest. We continued North and into the centre of Donauwörth. We locked up our bikes and spent half an hour or so wandering around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This was a much nicer old town with a couple of churches, old gates and town hall. The main street lined with brightly coloured houses in a similar way to other towns in this area. We saw all the main sights and visited tourist information to get some details of some longer bike routes in the area. We cycled back to the apartments via Mertingen as we wanted to have a look at the old brewery. We did not stop for a drink but it did look a pretty good place although at just under two miles away, it may be a bit too far for walking home from.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We decided not to eat out tonight. We drove to a supermarket and bought schnitzels to cook in the apartment. We also bought other food for the next couple of days and beer for tomorrow's play-off final. We ate after having showers and then watched the German Cup Final in the room.
