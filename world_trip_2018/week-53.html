            We were up at 5:15 again this morning for an early dive on Bari Reef. This did not start well as I discovered that my torch battery was flat after I had got in the water. It is just starting to get light at this time so not the end of the world but not ideal for the first 10 - 15 minutes either. We went South again from the entry point and again it was an enjoyable start to the day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After this dive, I went and got my high pressure hose replaced. It has been leaking for a few days but I was hoping it would last until we got home but this morning the leak seemed worse. It was still just about usable but had it got worse again, it could have caused problems. They had one hose left at the dive centgre and it took about 15 minutes to swap them round. We were on our way to for our next dive by about 8:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were a bit unsure about where to do the next two dives but were keen to head for Kapata again. This time instead of going straight there, we stopped to dive 1000 Steps on the way. Normal service was resumed here and Roz counted four green turtles although I only saw three of them. As this dive was good and the sea still seemed quite rough we decided to do a second dive here and miss out on Kapata. Entry/Exit is a lot easier at 1000 Steps. For the second dive here, we went South but then continued into the Northern shallow area to end the dive. One more green turtle on what was our last dive here for this trip.
