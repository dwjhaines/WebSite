            Three more local dives today. We were diving on our own with Simon today. He is another of the staff that we have dived with before. There were five other divers on the boat so still nice and empty with plenty of space. We went a bit further afield in the morning to a couple of dive sites around Kapali which is really just a big sand bank with a luxury resort built onto it. First dive was at Kapali Rock. There was a bit more reef here than at Mabul and the coral particularly in the shallows was very colourful.

            <p class="diary-text">
            The second site, Little Okinawa, was similar but we saw more on this dive. Roz counted seven turtles including the first hawksbill we have seen here on this trip. Simon also managed to find a weedy scorpion fish (rhinopia). These are quite rare here and it is the first time he has found one in over 8000 dives. We had only ever seen one in Ambon before so quite a good find.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were given the choice of where we wanted to go for the afternoon dive (no-one else from the boat this morning was diving) and chose Awas again. This was another very good dive. We saw another two frog fish, one of them so small it was only just possible to tell what it was. There were also a lot of turtles sleeping on the artificial reef structures at the end of the dive. Yesterday, we did not have much time to hang around the structures as we were getting low on bottom time. Today we were able to hang around them for 10 - 15 minutes.... before managing to lose our guide. We were just about back at the jetty by this point so it was not too big a problem!

            <p class="diary-text">Sipadan tomorrow so another early night.

            The diving around Mabul and Kapali is very good. However, the reason most people come here is the diving at Sipadan which is some of the best in the world and probably the best place we have ever dived. Sipadan is a sea-mount which rises up from over 1000m with the top of it forming a small island. The island is protected by the Malaysian government so there is no longer any accommodation there and there is a limit of 120 people a day that can dive there. Scuba Junkie get seven permits a day. We have booked eight days of diving with them meaning we get to go to Sipadan on two of those eight days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Sipadan days start early. There is a light breakfast served at 6:00 and we are all on the jetty by 6:15. After getting all the gear ready and having the first briefing of the day, it is a 30 minute boat ride to Sipadan. Once there, we sign in at the national park office and have another very long (too long) briefing and start diving just before 8:00. The day involves four dives, each of which is about 50 minutes with food provided between dives. We were diving with Simon again in a group with a Japanese couple and an instructor who was learning the sites.

            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Barracuda Point. This is regularly voted as one of the best dive sites in the world and we have had some of our best ever dives here. This was a very good dive again although not one of the best we have had here. The vis was not great and we did not see a couple of the usual attractions here like the bump heads and the barracuda but we did still see six turtles and about 22 sharks so could not really complain!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Dive number two was at Drop Off but continues along to the site of the first dive. This was by far the best dive of the day. We saw lots of turtles swimming from Drop Off to Barracuda Point and Roz counted 40 in total on the dive. There were turtles everywhere you looked at one point. The big school of jacks was in the usual place and we did get to see the bump heads as they swam above us in the opposite direction. Right at the end of the dive Simon managed to find the big school of barracuda. We did not see them in their tornado formation but did get to two big groups of them.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Dives 3 & 4 were at South Point and Hanging Gardens. On both dives we spent time in the blue looking for hammerheads without success. Both dive sites had very nice coral in the shadows and both featured plenty more turtles. In total Roz counted 85 bring her turtle count for the trip so far to 108 so far.
