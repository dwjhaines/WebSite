            Three more local dives today. We were diving on our own with Simon today. He is another of the staff that we have dived with before. There were five other divers on the boat so still nice and empty with plenty of space. We went a bit further afield in the morning to a couple of dive sites around Kapali which is really just a big sand bank with a luxury resort built onto it. First dive was at Kapali Rock. There was a bit more reef here than at Mabul and the coral particularly in the shallows was very colourful.
            </p>  
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-117.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            The second site, Little Okinawa, was similar but we saw more on this dive. Roz counted seven turtles including the first hawksbill we have seen here on this trip. Simon also managed to find a weedy scorpion fish (rhinopia). These are quite rare here and it is the first time he has found one in over 8000 dives. We had only ever seen one in Ambon before so quite a good find.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were given the choice of where we wanted to go for the afternoon dive (no-one else from the boat this morning was diving) and chose Awas again. This was another very good dive. We saw another two frog fish, one of them so small it was only just possible to tell what it was. There were also a lot of turtles sleeping on the artificial reef structures at the end of the dive. Yesterday, we did not have much time to hang around the structures as we were getting low on bottom time. Today we were able to hang around them for 10 - 15 minutes.... before managing to lose our guide. We were just about back at the jetty by this point so it was not too big a problem!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Sipadan tomorrow so another early night.

            The diving around Mabul and Kapali is very good. However, the reason most people come here is the diving at Sipadan which is some of the best in the world and probably the best place we have ever dived. Sipadan is a sea-mount which rises up from over 1000m with the top of it forming a small island. The island is protected by the Malaysian government so there is no longer any accommodation there and there is a limit of 120 people a day that can dive there. Scuba Junkie get seven permits a day. We have booked eight days of diving with them meaning we get to go to Sipadan on two of those eight days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Sipadan days start early. There is a light breakfast served at 6:00 and we are all on the jetty by 6:15. After getting all the gear ready and having the first briefing of the day, it is a 30 minute boat ride to Sipadan. Once there, we sign in at the national park office and have another very long (too long) briefing and start diving just before 8:00. The day involves four dives, each of which is about 50 minutes with food provided between dives. We were diving with Simon again in a group with a couple from Singapore and an instructor who was learning the sites.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-118.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Barracuda Point. This is regularly voted as one of the best dive sites in the world and we have had some of our best ever dives here. This was a very good dive again although not one of the best we have had here. The vis was not great and we did not see a couple of the usual attractions here like the bump heads and the barracuda but we did still see six turtles and about 22 sharks so could not really complain!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Dive number two was at Drop Off but continued along to Barracuda Point. This was by far the best dive of the day. We saw lots of turtles swimming from Drop Off to Barracuda Point and Roz counted 40 in total on the dive. There were turtles everywhere you looked at one point. The big school of jacks was in the usual place and we did get to see the bump heads as they swam above us in the opposite direction. Right at the end of the dive Simon managed to find the big school of barracuda. We did not see them in their tornado formation but did get to two big groups of them. This sort of dive is the reason we come to Sipadan!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Dives 3 & 4 were at South Point and Hanging Gardens. On both dives we spent time in the blue looking for hammerheads without success. Both dive sites had very nice coral in the shadows and both featured plenty more turtles. In total Roz counted 85 bring her turtle count for the trip so far to 108 so far.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the evening for the first time since getting to Malaysia. We had a couple of beers in the resort bar either side of the evening meal and then sat on our balcony and drank rather more of our duty free rum than we had planned to.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 24th October</span>
            Two dives at Kapali this morning - Kapali House Reef and Cleaning Station. We were diving with Asim and had Richard, a particularly clueless American, diving with us. The dives were both very enjoyable again. Kapali House Reef does not seem to have as much on it as it had when first dived it but there was still plenty to see. As well as a frog fish there was an ornate ghost pipe fish, a flamboyant cuttle fish (or flambo as they seem to be called now) and a leaf scorpion fish, none of which we had seen so far on this trip. The second dive was along a reef. Not too spectacular but there were a couple of huge turtles lying on the reef at the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived Eel Garden in the afternoon. This was another reef dive with nine more green turtles mainly sleeping on the reef (Roz's Turtle Count = 121).
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were both worn out after todays diving (and too much alcohol last night) so it was straight back to the room after tea and another early night.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 25th October</span>
            The first two dives today were at South Mabul. The boat was fuller this morning as there were a few snorkelers with us but we had a guide to ourselves again. It was back to Eel Garden for the first dive. This was not a great dive. We only saw two turtles but they were both hawksbills which was a bonus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Artificial Reef. This is a whole load of man made structures that have been placed in the water to form a reef. It was a nice enough dive site but we did not see many of the things that we were expecting to see there. As with some of the other macro sites here, there seems to be less interesting stuff about. We don't know if there are less things there or if the guides are just not as good at finding them this year. We did see an ornate ghost pipe fish but it was me that found that.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-120.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was the best dive of the day. Our guide was keen to dive at Awas but this time, we jumped in at Nudi Nook and swam all the way back. Nudi Nook was a bit sad. When we started diving there six or seven years ago, it was full of colourful nudibranchs, hence the name of the site. Now there is not a lot apart from sand and dead coral and we did not see a single one. We did see a turtle as soon as we got in and the dive improved as we got back towards Awas. We saw a flying gurnard and had a brief view of another eagle ray. I found the flamboyant cuttle fish and there was another small yellow frog fish near the one we had seen a couple of times already. We ended by the structures that always seem to have the sleeping turtles on it before swimming back to the jetty. All the dives today were over 65 minutes so we can have no complaints about the dive times.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the third dive we ventured outside the resort for the first time on this trip and walked round the island. It is not that big and only takes 10 - 15 minutes to go all the way round if you did it non-stop. Not too much to see apart from the local village with a few food and souvenir shops and a few 1.5m long monitor lizards wandering around. Apart from this, it was another uneventful early night.

            A much better days diving today! Firstly, the conditions are getting better. We had rain on the day we came out to Mabul which affected the visibility. It has been dry since and today the vis was a lot better. Secondly, we were led by Khai today. He is a guide who we have dived with when we have previously dived with Scuba Junkie. He is probably their best guide. He is a lot more enthusiastic about the diving than some of the others and he is able to find a lot more for us to look at. We would have been diving with him earlier but he has had a broken finger and has been out of the water since we arrived. We were joined in our group by Kate, who we later discovered will be staying in Derawan for the same two weeks as us when we leave Mabul.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-121.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Second Wall which was a much better site than some of the ones around Mabul. It was a proper wall drift dive with quite strong currents at times. It was a lot more spectacular than some of the sloping reefs we have been diving here. The second was back to muck diving at Paradise, just in front of the resort. A very nice dive with three frog fish and a couple more flamboyant cuttle fish. There is also a reasonable size wreck which has been put there in the last few years so quite a variety of stuff to see.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Khai was very keen to do a long dive at Awas for the third dive of the day and we were happy to dive there again despite having been there three times already. This was a 93 minute dive. A lot of the things we saw were the same as on our previous dives but in addition, there was a tiny flamboyant cuttle fish (as well as the normal size one we saw yesterday), nudibranches and a juvenile ornate ghost pipe fish. Just the one large green turtle at the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Tomorrow is our second trip to Sipadan so it was another early night.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 27th October</span>
            Our second (and last) trip to Sipadan so another early start. Today there were only three other customers diving - three Swedes who will also be traveling to Derawan with us on Monday. There were also two DMT's on the boat who are just finishing their course so get to go to Sipadan for one day. The boat was led by Katrine (from Ghent) with two guides, Man and Khai. We were told on Sipadan that we would be guided by Man but he seemed just to tag along at the back as Khai led us and the DMT's
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-122.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Another very good days diving. We started the day at South Point. This was not the best dive of the day. This year, there seems to be more emphasis than in the past on staying out in the blue looking for bigger things like hammerheads. This is all OK if you see something but we think we have been unlucky here and have hardly ever had any success. This just means that a lot of the dive is wasted when we would probably rather just stay on the reef. Once we were back on the reef, it was a very good dive with all the usual turtles and sharks. Dive 2 was at Hanging Garden. Again, we had 15 - 20 minutes out in the blue but a very enjoyable dive along the reef when we got back to it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The best two dives of the day were 3 and 4 at Barracuda Point and Drop Off. At Barracuda Point, I had lost count of the turtles within two minutes of being in the water. We briefly saw the big school of jacks before moving into the shallows to concentrate on the bump-head parrot fish. After this, we got swept along the reef by strong currents and it was quite hard work to stay together and close to the reef. We were still flying past sharks and turtles, through schools of red-tooth trigger fish and although a bit more challenging, there was still plenty to see.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Things had calmed down a bit by the time we dived Drop Off. We still covered a similar distance and ended the dive at turtle rock but the current was less and it was all a bit more controlled. We started by going into Turtle Cave further than you are supposed to and had another brief look at the jacks as we went past Barracuda Point. Roz counted 31 turtles on this dive bring the total for the day to 70. (Roz's Turtle Count = 206)
