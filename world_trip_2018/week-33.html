            We were up at 4:45 (slightly earlier than yesterday), checked out of the hotel and got a taxi back to Pier 1. It was all a bit chaotic at the pier but we checked in, left our luggage and got on the Weesam ferry for Maasin. The ferry was full but we were in an air-conditioned section and it was comfortable enough. At 6:00, we finally left Cebu City! The stay in Cebu has not been too bad. The first day and a half were not great but once we had accepted that we were staying until Monday and moved to the Tsai Hotel, it has been fine. Still good to be on our way again.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-178.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The ferry journey to Maasin took about three hours. We were met there, together with three others by a minibus from Peter's Dive Resort. The journey to the resort on Sogod Bay took about 45 minutes. We checked in and were taken to a bungalow right on the beach. The room is basic but has plenty of space and a really nice balcony. We put our names down for the 2:30 dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch at the resort's restaurant, we both started taking amoxicillin in an attempt to get rid of our infections. On both of us, the cuts are healing and the infection is getting less but we would like to get them cleared up completely. We usually carry amoxicillin when traveling so will give it a go for a few days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The 2:30 dive got changed to being a 2:00 dive so we left the room in a bit of a rush just before 2:00. The dive boats are the traditional Philippine bangkas and are moored just in front of the resort. Getting out to them is a bit of an effort as the sea is quite rough and there are plenty of rocks in the shallows. As Roz's initial minor cut that led to the infection was caused by such a rock, we were particularly cautious going in. The first dive site was the house reef, right in front of the resort so only took a minute to get to. We dived in a group of three with Eli and were led by a French guide, Flo. The dive was not great as the vis was poor and we did not see a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">They normally do two dives in the morning here and one in the afternoon but we were offered the chance to do a night dive this evening at Padre Burgos Pier. This is a small town a couple of miles away and we had read about the night dive before we had got here. We did not know if we would get a chance to do it again so agreed to go. We left the dive centre at 5:30ish and were getting in the water as it was getting dark just before 6. We dived with Eli again but this dive was led by Titing,a local guide. As with other town pier dives we have done, there was a lot of rubbish to wade through to get to the pier and a lot of rubbish around the pier itself but also a lot of interesting stuff living amongst it all. We saw quite a few small cuttle fish, a frog fish and a sea-horse so definitely better than a lot of night dives. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, we cleaned our gear, showered and ate in the restaurant. There was not a lot going on in the way of New Year's Eve celebrations but we had a couple of beers with our meal and then a couple more drinks on the balcony. If we had arrived here when we were meant to, we would have had a break from diving tomorrow and had a few more drinks tonight. Instead, we were quite keen to do the morning dives tomorrow so had a quieter night.  It was still an enjoyable evening but we did not bother staying up until midnight.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 1st January, 2019</span>
            We were on the 8:30 dive boat this morning. We went South of the resort to Limasawa Island today for two dives. Again, we were with Eli and Titing. Both the dives were quite similar and featured steep walls with spectacular hard coral. The sites were excellent but the dives were not as good as they could have been as the vis was once again pretty poor. We saw two frog fish on the first dive but it was the coral that should have been the highlight had the vis been better.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to do the afternoon dive as well but the sea was rougher again when we got back. Getting back to the beach from the boat was hard work again and we decided to have the afternoon off. Our injuries are getting a lot better but we really do not want to aggravate them by falling onto rocks again. We will probably do this quite a lot here as the local sites are not as good as the ones they visit in the mornings.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch and amended our reservation so that we will leave here next Monday. The original plan was for seven nights here so that has not been altered by the delay in Cebu. The diving here has not been as good as we had expected so far, mainly because of the bad weather and we could have left earlier. However, it is a very nice place to stay and if the diving does not improve it will still be very easy to spend the week here. Had a lazy afternoon in the room or on the balcony.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, there was a party by the pool to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the opening of the dive resort. This involved a buffet meal including the traditional spit roasted pig, a few beers, karaoke and party games. All the guests as well as the staff and their families were there and it was a reasonably entertaining evening. We were still back in the room by 9:00 so not too late a night.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 2nd January</span>
            A similar morning to yesterday - two dives from the boat which left at 8:30. The dives today were at Napantao which is on the opposite side of Sogod Bay to where we are staying. The dives were very good again but as with yesterday, could have been a lot better with decent vis. On the first at the Northern part of the site, we saw a couple of turtles. A large hawksbill swam through the centre of us all not long after we had gone down and then Roz spotted another one at the top of the wall during the dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">On the second dive on the Southern section, we saw another hawksbill as soon as we descended. We also saw another very nicely positioned frog-fish. Lots of nudis and other small fish all over both dive sites. There were a lot of big waves around when we got back so we again decided not to do the afternoon dive. No-one else was doing it today as the people who did dive yesterday afternoon said that the dive had been poor with 2m visibility. With the weather the same, it was unlikely that todays dive would have been any better. Had a similar afternoon to yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we were told that there was a problem with one of the two dive boats. The boat may be fixed by 8:30 but this seems unlikely. One of the boats is doing a whale shark trip tomorrow that we are not interested in meaning that we we will have to do shore diving. This is not ideal but we plan to give it a go and see what happens. We will probably leave a day or two early if it happens again when the next whale shark trip is due on Saturday. We ate in the resort restaurant again where the food is very good.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 3rd January</span>
            Surprisingly, the boat was repaired by the time we got up and the trip went ahead as normal. We were diving with Eli for the last time (he leaves tomorrow) and were led by Arnel. (We had been due to be guided by Flo but Roz told them we did want to dive with him again and we wanted a Philippine guide).
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-181.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive sites today were to the North of the resort. The first was reasonably enjoyable despite the vis being crap again. Arnel was a lot better at pointing things out to us and we saw two ornate ghost pipe fish, the first we have seen since Derawan. The second at Maltibog Lembeh was a very good muck dive if not quite up to Lembeh standards. Loads to see here - two more ornates as well as two robust ghost pipe fish, four Pegasus sea-moths, a sea-horse and a juvenile frog-fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The boat broke down again on the way back with a problem not related to the original one. We were later told that the captain had reversed over a rope which had wrapped around the propeller and broken the drive shaft. We were close to the coast so got dropped off and had to wait for a van to come and pick us all up. Probably a quicker and easier way of getting back to the resort in the end. Spent most of the afternoon in the room. When I did try and go and sit on the balcony, it was too cold and wet. The boat got towed back at about 5 but then got taken away for repair. It will be out of action for a few more days apparently.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Another quiet night with a meal in the resort restaurant and an early night.

            Woke up to heavy rain. The weather has not been great since we got here and it has been raining just about constantly since yesterday afternoon. The wind is coming from the East and the rain has been coming just about vertically onto our balcony. Perfect weather to go diving in! When we had looked at the board last night, there were 19 or 20 divers due to be on the boat. Usually they would take two boats with this number of divers but with one boat still out of action, we were all due to be on the same boat. As it was, the weather put a few people off diving so the boat was not too crowded. Roz has a bit of a cold and was considering not going as well but decided to dive as there is not a lot else to do here.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did the same two dive sites as two days ago - Napantao North and South. We were diving with Titing again today and were joined by an Australian couple, Brandon and Emilie. Again the dive sites were good but the vis was worse than two days ago so again, the dives were not great. We saw the same giant frog-fish on the second dive as we had seen last time and a couple of white-tip reef sharks sleeping under table coral but not too much else. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It rained heavily just about the whole morning and was still raining when we got back to the resort. We did consider changing our plans again and leaving early but it seems the whole region is affected by the bad weather and we would not gain a lot by moving anywhere else. Spent the afternoon in the room as it is still not possible to sit on our balcony. Ate in the restaurant again in the evening. Roz's cold getting worse. Another early night.

            A brighter start to the day. Still very windy but the rain had finally stopped. It was a 7:30 departure today as they still only have one working boat and they wanted to do the dive trip and a whale shark trip. The two dives today were at Medicare South and Medicare North, two sites so named because of their proximity to the local medical centre. We were guided today by Jordon and were joined by Diane and Sebastian. Predictably, after 36 hours of rain the visibility was terrible. The coral was still good and we saw turtles on both dives, two on the first and one on the second. Saw quite a few nudibranches as well so not too bad without being too memorable either.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the dive centre by 11:30 so that the whale shark trip could depart at midday. The scheduling of the trips has not been ideal for us. We leave on Monday so an early finish tomorrow would have given us the afternoon to dry our gear. Instead, tomorrow will be a three tank trip to Limasawa Island meaning a later than usual end to the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. The balcony was usable again so spent the afternoon either there or in the room. We did not eat until about 8:30 in the evening. We had a couple of beers with our meal and then a few drinks on the balcony while following the football. We did not stay up for the second half but went to bed before midnight.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 6th January</span>
            Three dives at Limasawa Island today. All very similar to the first time we were here on Tuesday. The first two dives were at Gunter's wall but in different directions and the third was at Adrian's Cove. We saw the same small red frog-fish on the first dive that we had seen before and two giant frog-fish on the second. Everyone but me saw a hawksbill turtle on the second dive and Roz found a green sea turtle that appeared to be nesting on the third. As with most of our dives here, they were all enjoyable enough dives but the poor vis meant that they were not as good as they could have been.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort by 4pm. We washed our gear and hung up BCD's and wet-suits in the hope that they will be dry by 6am tomorrow. We had a few drinks in the evening. We had the end of our duty free Bacardi and some Sang Som left over from Thailand that we did not want to take with us. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before eating, a couple of beers with our meal and then we finished the bottles on the balcony again. Still a relatively early night.
