            Neither me nor Roz felt that well today. It did not feel like a hangover and we had not had that much to drink last night but the combination of drinks we had consumed probably did not help. We spent most of the day sleeping and neither of us felt like eating. We did make it to the pool for a few hours but even then, I had to lie in the shade.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did make it out to eat in the evening as we were both starting to feel better. We went back to the taverna with Hoggy and Sarah and were able to eat a meal. We returned to the hotel early leaving Hoggy to drink the four complimentary ouzos we had been given.

            Both feeling just about 100% better this morning and were able to eat a proper breakfast. We were at the pool by 10:00 and were able to lie in the sun again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I checked out at 11:30 and walked across the harbour to wait for the 12:10 ferry to Alonnisos (Hoggy and Sarah were to follow on the 16:20). The boat was just about on time and by 1:00 we had arrived at the port of Patitiri. Our hotel was only a few minutes walk away from the harbour again. This time, we had probably the best balcony of the trip with a superb view of the harbour. The harbour itself is picturesque with the small town right above it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a walk round the town and bought things for lunch which we ate on the balcony. At 4ish, we went down to the small beach which is in the harbour itself. It is a stony beach but is only a few minutes walk away and is nice enough. Very calm, clear water again so good to swim in. We met the others just after 5:00 as we walked back to the hotel and they checked into the room next door to ours so we have adjacent balconies.
