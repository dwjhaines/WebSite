            Neither me nor Roz felt that well today. It did not feel like a hangover and we had not had that much to drink last night but the combination of drinks we had consumed probably did not help. We spent most of the day sleeping and neither of us felt like eating. We did make it to the pool for a few hours but even then, I had to lie in the shade.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did make it out to eat in the evening as we were both starting to feel better. We went back to the taverna with Hoggy and Sarah and were able to eat a meal. We returned to the hotel early leaving Hoggy to drink the four complimentary ouzos we had been given.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 14th August</span>
            Both feeling just about 100% better this morning and were able to eat a proper breakfast. We were at the pool by 10:00 and were able to lie in the sun again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I checked out at 11:30 and walked across to the harbour to wait for the 12:10 ferry to Alonnisos (Hoggy and Sarah were to follow on the 16:20). The boat was just about on time and by 1:00 we had arrived at the port of Patitiri. Our hotel (Hotel Kavos) was only a few minutes walk away from the harbour again. This time, we had probably the best balcony of the trip with a superb view of the harbour. The harbour itself is picturesque with the small town right above it.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

                src="images/WT2018-081.JPG">
            </div><p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a walk round the town and bought things for lunch which we ate on the balcony. At 4ish, we went down to the small beach which is in the harbour itself. It is a stony beach but is only a few minutes walk away and is nice enough. Very calm, clear water again so good to swim in. We met the others just after 5:00 as we were walking back from the beach and they were getting off their ferry. We walked back to the hotel and they checked into the room next door to ours so we have adjacent balconies.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We just about managed to fit all four of us onto our balcony for drinks before we went out. We had a bit of indecision about where to eat and ended up in a cafe type place where we stopped for a drink and starters before where deciding where to go. Ended up drinking a lot in there, ordering more food and not really remembering leaving. A good night out!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th August</span>
            A couple of trips to the beach today and not much else until the evening. Roz and I went to the same beach as yesterday in the morning and we all went to Rousoumi beach in the afternoon. Rousoumi was a bigger beach about ten minutes walk away on the other side of the ridge that our hotel is on.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Had a similar evening to yesterday starting with drinks on the balcony. We ate at a taverna by the harbour. It was not quite as nice a setting as yesterday but there was a lot more options on the menu. We had an excellent meal with a few litres of wine before returning to the hotel slightly more sober than we had been last night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th August</span>
            Did not make it to the beach until about midday. The amount of food we ate last night combined with the amount of wine we have consumed in the last week or so meant another morning recovering! We made it to the local beach for a couple of hours at midday and spent quite a bit of the afternoon sat on the balcony watching the yachts coming and going. Roz and I went to watch a twenty minute video about the monk seals that live in this area but apart from that, did not do a lot all day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were having a quieter evening tonight as Hoggy and Sarah are on an early ferry tomorrow. Instead of drinks on the balcony at 7:00, we went to have a look at the old town of Alonnisos. The old town is at the top of a hill a couple of miles away. Hoggy, Roz and I walked  up there and Sarah got the bus. We spent 10 minutes or so walking around the town which was nicer than I was expecting then all walked back down to Patitiri. We got back just before 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we went back to the taverna we had eaten in last night and had another very good meal. There was a lot less wine consumed by everyone, (I had none at all - I decided I need a few days off) and we were back in the room by 11:00 to watch most of the second half of Sunderland v Sheff Wed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 17th August</span>
            Hoggy and Sarah had left by the time we got up as they were on a 7:30 ferry to Skiathos. We will meet up with them again next week. Our ferry was not until 12:30 so we were able to have an hour or so on the beach before checking out of the hotel at midday. We walked down to the harbour after checking out and had about 45 minutes to wait before the ferry came in. We were on the Hellenic Seaways Skiathos Express, the same boat we arrived on three days ago. It eventually departed almost an hour late at 13:25.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">The ferry was a lot more crowded than the previous ones we had been on but we found seats in the air-conditioned bit and it was a reasonably comfortable journey again. We were due to get in at 16:15 but docked just over an hour late. It seemed to take forever to get off the ferry but was probably about 20 minutes. It was all a bit chaotic at the port but we walked outside and saw someone getting out of a taxi. We were in the right place to jump straight into it and by 6pm, we were back at Hotel Stella. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a walk along the beach and to buy a few things from the supermarket. Also checked that the car was OK. It was a bit dusty but all intact with the bikes still attached and it started first time which was good news. The Macedonian battery still seems to be working!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had another quiet evening. We went out to eat at one of the restaurants along the beach. Although the beach here is not that good, the restaurants have superb locations spread out along the front so it is a lot cooler eating here than in the more crowded restaurants on the islands. Although neither of us were that keen on eating much, we ended up having another really good meal. We walked back to the hotel by 10:00 to watch the Birmingham v Swansea game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 18th August</span>
            We had breakfast on our balcony (not quite as scenic as the one in Alonnisos!) and checked out of the hotel at 9:15. Today we had a drive of about 150 miles to Agia Triada, a beach resort about 10 miles the other side of Thessaloniki. This is not the greatest beach in Greece and is not somewhere we would go out of our way to visit but we are flying out of Thessaloniki airport on Monday and it is only a few miles away. It is a convenient place to stop for a couple of nights and will make it easy to get to the airport on Monday. We had one stop on the way to clean the car's windows as the back one in particular was difficult to see through. Apart from the temperature at one point hitting 40°c and the car's air-conditioning still not working, it was another easy journey. Most of the journey was on the main Athens - Thessaloniki toll motorway which even on a Saturday in August, had very little traffic on it.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived at the hotel at Agia Triada at about 12:30. We were told we would have an hour to wait while our room was being cleaned so we walked round the area and bought stuff for lunch while we waited. We checked into a room overlooking the sea and had lunch on the balcony again. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-082.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out on our bikes at 5ish. Neither Swansea or Sunderland were playing today so we did not have much interest in the football. The beach stretches for a few miles in each direction so we followed the road as far as we could both ways, a round trip of just over ten miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We watched the sun setting from our balcony with a glass of wine. Although we have had some excellent views from rooms since getting to Greece, this is the first place where we have really been able to see the sun setting from. We chose to eat at a taverna a block or so back from the beach. We had seen a group of them opposite each other when we had been walking around at lunchtime. Although the ones on the seafront looked good again, these were also nice places and the food and wine were quite a bit cheaper. Had a very good meal again with a litre of the local wine. We returned to the balcony after eating and finished the last of the bottles we had bought from Macedonia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 19th August</span>
            We had breakfast on the balcony and then went in to have a look around Thessaloniki. We had thought about cycling in as it is only about 10 - 12 miles away but when driving to the hotel yesterday, we realised that the road that we would have to have used is certainly not suitable for cycling. Fortunately there is a pier just outside our hotel from where boats depart five or six times a day. The boats go along the coast to the other beaches we cycled past yesterday and then take about 50 minutes to get into Thessaloniki.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">We got the 10:00 boat and were dropped by the White Tower which is one of Thessaloniki's main sights. Thessaloniki is another city where there are quite a few things to see but none of them are that spectacular. Although it is the second biggest city in Greece, it does not come close to Athens for sightseeing. It was an enjoyable enough few hours, however. We were able to take our bikes on the boat so first of all cycled along the waterfront towards the port. We went as far as the hotel I had stayed in when I first visited the city while doing Inter-Rail in 1984 with Dave and Regan (Hotel Vergina - we were easily amused when we were younger!). We then cycled back to the White Tower, locked up our bikes and continued with the rest of our tour on foot.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-083.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked up to the old city walls passing a few churches and arches along the way. The walls were probably the highlight of the tour, or more specifically, the views from the area around the walls. We spent a while up there looking at the views (and recovering from the walk up) before walking along to a monastery nearby. We headed back down to the White Tower passing a few more churches along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We had planned to end the walk at a restaurant that was recommended in Lonely Planet but this was closed when we got to it so we resorted to a Dominoes pizza for lunch. Not quite as authentically Greek as planned but a very enjoyable change from Greek food anyway. We did a few more miles the other way along the waterfront on our bikes while waiting for the 15:50 boat back to Agia Triada and were at our hotel by 17:00
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at the same place as last night and had a very similar evening.
