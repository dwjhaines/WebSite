            Neither me nor Roz felt that well today. It did not feel like a hangover and we had not had that much to drink last night but the combination of drinks we had consumed probably did not help. We spent most of the day sleeping and neither of us felt like eating. We did make it to the pool for a few hours but even then, I had to lie in the shade.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We did make it out to eat in the evening as we were both starting to feel better. We went back to the taverna with Hoggy and Sarah and were able to eat a meal. We returned to the hotel early leaving Hoggy to drink the four complimentary ouzos we had been given.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 14th August</span>
            Both feeling just about 100% better this morning and were able to eat a proper breakfast. We were at the pool by 10:00 and were able to lie in the sun again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I checked out at 11:30 and walked across to the harbour to wait for the 12:10 ferry to Alonnisos (Hoggy and Sarah were to follow on the 16:20). The boat was just about on time and by 1:00 we had arrived at the port of Patitiri. Our hotel (Hotel Kavos) was only a few minutes walk away from the harbour again. This time, we had probably the best balcony of the trip with a superb view of the harbour. The harbour itself is picturesque with the small town right above it.
            </p>

            </div><p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a walk round the town and bought things for lunch which we ate on the balcony. At 4ish, we went down to the small beach which is in the harbour itself. It is a stony beach but is only a few minutes walk away and is nice enough. Very calm, clear water again so good to swim in. We met the others just after 5:00 as we were walking back from the beach and they were getting off their ferry. We walked back to the hotel and they checked into the room next door to ours so we have adjacent balconies.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We just about managed to fit all four of us onto our balcony for drinks before we went out. We had a bit of indecision about where to eat and ended up in a cafe type place where we stopped for a drink and starters before where deciding where to go. Ended up drinking a lot in there, ordering more food and not really remembering leaving. A good night out!
            </p>

            A couple of trips to the beach today and not much else until the evening. Roz and I went to the same beach as yesterday in the morning and we all went to Rousoumi beach in the afternoon. Rousoumi was a bigger beach about ten minutes walk away on the other side of the ridge that our hotel is on.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Had a similar evening to yesterday starting with drinks on the balcony. We ate at a taverna by the harbour. It was not quite as nice a setting as yesterday but there was a lot more options on the menu. We had an excellent meal with a few litres of wine before returning to the hotel slightly more sober than we had been last night.
            </p>

            Did not make it to the beach until about midday. The amount of food we ate last night combined with the amount of wine we have consumed in the last week or so meant another morning recovering! We made it to the local beach for a couple of hours at midday and spent quite a bit of the afternoon sat on the balcony watching the yachts coming and going. Roz and I went to watch a twenty minute video about the monk seals that live in this area but apart from that, did not do a lot all day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were having a quieter evening tonight as Hoggy and Sarah are on an early ferry tomorrow. Instead of drinks on the balcony at 7:00, we went to have a look at the old town of Alonnisos. The old town is at the top of a hill a couple of miles away. Hoggy, Roz and I walked  up there and Sarah got the bus. We spent 10 minutes or so walking around the town which was nicer than I was expecting then all walked back down to Patitiri. We got back just before 9:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we went back to the taverna we had eaten in last night and had another very good meal. There was a lot less wine consumed by everyone, (I had none at all - I decided I need a few days off) and we were back in the room by 11:00 to watch most of the second half of Sunderland v Sheff Wed.
            </p>

            Hoggy and Sarah had left by the time we got up as they were on a 7:30 ferry to Skiathos. We will meet up with them again next week. Our ferry was not until 12:30 so we were able to have an hour or so on the beach before checking out of the hotel at midday. We walked down to the harbour after checking out and had about 45 minutes to wait before the ferry came in. We were on the Hellenic Seaways Skiathos Express, the same boat we arrived on three days ago. It eventually departed almost an hour late at 13:25.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">The ferry was a lot more crowded than the previous ones we had been on but we found seats in the air-conditioned bit and it was a reasonably comfortable journey again. We were due to get in at 16:15 but docked just over an hour late. It seemed to take forever to get off the ferry but was probably about 20 minutes. It was all a bit chaotic at the port but we walked outside and saw someone getting out of a taxi. We were in the right place to jump straight into it and by 6pm, we were back at Hotel Stella. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out for a walk along the beach and to buy a few things from the supermarket. Also checked that the car was OK. It was a bit dusty but still in tact and it started first time which was good news.
