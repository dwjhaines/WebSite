            We checked out of the hotel at 6:00 and were taken by Uber to Mike Ball's office. There we filled in our paperwork for the trip and waited around with everyone else until we were driven to the airport. There are 27 customers on the one week liveaboard. There is us, together with a group of 21 from The States. Two of the remaining four are from Australia, one from Switzerland with the last "customer" being Mike Ball himself. Two buses took us to the airport where we were given our boarding passes for the scenic flight to Lizard Island. We were split into three groups and put into three 10-seater planes.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The trip we are doing is the "Turtle Spectacular" which heads North from Lizard Island and goes up as far as Raine Island.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Raine Island is the largest and most important green sea turtle nesting area in the world, with up to 18,000 females nesting on the small coral sand cay in one season. We saw a documentary about the island about four years ago and Roz has been keen to go there ever since. There are only a couple of operators who come to this part of the Great Barrier Reef and Mike Ball only comes here twice a year in November. Roz found the dates of this trip in March of last year and booked it straight away. The rest of the trip has been planned around it. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a one hour, low altitude flight over the Barrier Reef which, as advertised, was very scenic. We waited around at LIzard Island for all three planes to get in then had a twenty minute walk to the other side of the island from where we were taken out to "Spoilsport" the boat that we will be on for the next week. The boat is really nice, certainly a step up in terms of luxury from the live-aboard boats we have dived from in the last few years. We have one of the only two "budget" cabins meaning that our cabin has no windows and no bathroom. However, this is not a big issue and it was a big saving compared to the en-suite rooms. There is a huge in-door seating and dining area and loads of space on the dive deck. We were given snacks, a selection of briefings before getting our gear set up and having lunch. Food looks as if it is going to be very good! First dive was just before 3pm.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-149.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first two dives of the trip were at Cod Hole. This site is famous for the giant potato cod that live there. Most of the diving on this trip will be unguided but there is always the option of diving with a guide. During the briefing, everyone was asked if they wanted to go down to 33m to see pygmy sea-horses. We were the only ones interested so we had a guide to ourselves for this dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The dive was OK. We did just about see the sea-horses and we did see some potato cod as well as a few white tips. However, it was not as good as the second which we did on our own. This time we were first in the water and saw a lot of the cod. One of them swam with us for about 15 - 20 minutes and was close enough to touch most of that time. It was quite unnerving having such a large fish swimming alongside you seemingly as interested in us as we were in him. There also a few bumpheads around the end of the dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Both of us had a few issues with our cameras on the first dive. The old ones were set up for diving about six years ago so we never needed to change the settings. There were a few things not set up correctly but most of these had been sorted out by the second dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The evening meal was very good again and we were back in the cabin by 8ish as we begun the long overnight journey North.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 27th November</span>
            We were woken for breakfast at 6:30 but had still not arrived at the next dive site. Someone's luggage had been left in Cairns when we left yesterday. It had been flown out to Lizard Island but we had to return to the island to collect it before heading North. This put the whole day behind schedule and eventually meant that we did one less dive.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-150.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">There was a presentation from one of the crew about coral spawning while we continued towards the dive site where we finally arrived at about 8:00. There was then a lot of messing about due to currents and winds and so we did not get into the water until just after 9:00. Once we did get in, the dive site was very good. We did the first two dives at Erehwon. The first was a drift dive. We were dropped off and picked up by the zodiacs and went with the current along the reef. By the time of the second dive, the current had dropped and they were able to moor the boat meaning we could dive from the boat and return to it at the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Both dives were very enjoyable with plenty to see. We dived on our own again and saw sharks on both dives. Both dives had interesting coral formations and plenty of fish but we are still waiting to see our fist turtle. After another very good lunch (Mexican), they announced that due to being behind schedule, there would only be three dives today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive of the day was at Aladin's Wall, an "exploratory dive" as they have never dived here before. This was very nice in places with more sharks and we finally saw our first turtle of the trip. A similar evening to yesterday - good food followed by an early night and another long overnight journey North.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 28th November</span>
            A slightly earlier start today. There was still a delay of 45 minutes or so while the boat was put into position but we were in the water just before 8am. We did two dives at Vertigo Dream which were both excellent. The boat was moored on the reef so for the first dive, we jumped from the boat and swam out to the reef. We had to swim into a reasonably strong current at the start of the dive and the site did not look great despite there being a few sharks around.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After about 20 minutes, there seemed to be a lot of activity at around 5m at the top of the reef. It was a bit early to go up to that depth but we went anyway and it was really spectacular. Coral spawning is due to start about now and this may (or may not) have been responsible for a huge feeding frenzy of jacks, giant travally, rainbow runners, etc. This was all going on on top of a colourful reef with plenty of reef fish all over it as well. We stayed in almost the same spot for most of the dive. The current was too strong to go further along the reef and we did not want to get swept back so we stuck our sticks into the reef and clung on while we watched the display.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">By the second dive, the current had dropped a lot but they took us by dinghy along the reef so that we could spend the dive drifting back along the reef to the boat. This was very good again. We saw lots more sharks, the big schools of fish again and had the bonus of seeing two rather startled looking hawksbill turtles (they are not used to divers up here).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Third dive was at Eel Bay. This was another very good dive. The vis was not great and it was a bit dark but the hard coral was incredible. People are getting quite excited about it starting to spawn in the next couple of days and it did appear to be starting to happen on this dive. Either way, it was really spectacular to look at particularly in the shallows. Roz managed to find an epaulette shark. We are not sure whether or not we have ever seen one of these before but we have certainly not seen very many. The final dive of the day was a night dive in the same place as the previous dive. We got in the water just as it was getting dark and spent an hour looking at a few crabs, shrimps and a couple of octopus. Not a great night dive but the coral was still spectacular and more interesting than anything else on the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 29th November</span>
            First dive of the day was at a site called Epic. Epic was certainly not a word that could be used to describe the dive! We were moored by 6am so were in the water on time for a change. Roz and I were first in. There was quite a strong current and getting round to the line was a bit of a challenge but once at the line, it was easy enough to go down. The site was a large submerged bommie and the plan was to get down and swim around it however many times. The current made this just about impossible. We got to a plateau on one side of the bommie that was sheltered from the current and spent most of the dive there before drifting off to be collected by the dinghy. Most other divers tried to stick to the plan and had to abort the dive early. The vis was very poor and there was not a lot to see so overall, not great.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive two was at Raine Island. This turned out to be the most disappointing dive we have ever done. The reason we booked this trip and the main reason we have come to Australia is to see the turtles at Raine Island. We have read that you can regularly see 250 in an hour underwater here. We fully expected the total of 92 we saw on a single dive in Maratua to be well beaten. I saw two and Roz saw three.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-152.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">There had been a few comments from the boat crew during the last few days which had implied that the numbers may be down this year but neither of us were expecting this. In Sipadan and Maratua, as soon as you get in the water you start seeing turtles and know there are going to be a lot during the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the first five minutes of this dive, we had not seen any. The vis was terrible and both of us soon realised that the dive was going to be poor. I saw one turtle in the distance, we both saw another turtle for a minute or two before it swan off and then Roz had brief sightings of another two. After four years of looking into this trip and having booked it 20 months ago, Roz was pretty devastated by it all. The dive itself was not that bad. The reef was in good condition and there were a lot of fish but this is not what we had come all this way to see.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">No-one is sure why they are not here. The winds have been different to usual for the last week or so and the temperatures a lot higher than normal. The visibility has been poor and diving conditions no-where near what they should be but still no-one knows which of these reasons if any have affected the turtles. It does not make a lot of difference to us anyway, the turtles that we had come to see are not there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive three was similar to the second one. I saw one turtle. Roz saw the same one and briefly saw another two. The whole dive was very sad as it was hard to concentrate on what was there as opposed to thinking about what we had been expecting it to be like.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Fourth dive was probably the best of the day. A steep wall with a few caves and nice coral at the top of the reef. Had almost too close a view of a couple of grey reef sharks, lots of big fish around and our first wobbegong of this trip. Also saw a turtle at the end of the dive. The fifth dive of the day was a night dive after the evening meal. We do not like doing night dives this way round but two days ago a few people had voted to dive after eating. Most of them did not do the dive! We dived with one of the guides this time and it was a reasonable dive with a few crabs and shrimps to look at. We had a couple of glasses of wine when we had showered after the dive and did not get to bed until after 11.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 30th November</span>
            A better start to today with two dives on Wishbone Reef. We were in the water by 7:30 and it was a huge improvement on yesterdays dives. We had clear blue water meaning the best vis of the trip so far. The dives were at different locations along the reef but both sites featured spectacular walls with a lot of shark activity. There were white-tips, silver-tips and grey reef sharks all circling around beneath us particularly at the deeper parts of the dives. The tops of the reefs were healthy with coral and teaming with reef fish. Nothing will make up for yesterday but at least we had a couple of decent dives that we could both enjoy. We also saw a hawksbill turtle on the second dive but again, it was very nervous of divers and soon swam off when we went too close.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive three was not until 4pm. This was at Mantis Reef South. This was similar to the first two dives but not quite as good. We had to swim into quite strong current for the first 30 minutes or so. There were still sharks and fish around, just not as many. The wall and coral were spectacular but not as good as at Wishbone Reef. Still an enjoyable dive. The night dive was at the same site..... before the evening meal!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st December</span>
            First two dives of the day were at Bijou Reef. Again, it was a slightly late start as it took more than an hour to get the boat moored up. For the first dive there was a bit of current so we were taken by dinghy to a point up the reef and had a drift dive back. This was OK but not as good as yesterday's dives. The vis was not as good and we did not see as much. We did see one shark but on every dive here we have seen a few sharks and yesterday we lost count. There were fish around but again, not as many as yesterday.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-154.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">By the second dive, the current had dropped completely so we could dive from the back of the big boat. We were just about the first in and dropped straight onto a large school of barracuda. This was a spectacular sight as they formed a tornado and swam around us. After they had dropped below 30m, we managed to find the reef and continued our dive. There was a lot more light by the time of this dive and a lot more reef fish as well as another hawksbill turtle. The whole dive was a lot more enjoyable than the first.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed North again after the second dive for some reason and did two dives at Cat Reef. The boat was moored right above the reef this time so probably the easiest dive so far for entry/exit. We had been told there were two cuttle fish at 7m near the mooring line and we went straight to these when we got in the water. There were actually three there, two of which were laying eggs. After photographing these for a while we continued along the reef and had quite a nice dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the fourth, the boat was not moving so we had the option of late afternoon or night dive. We jumped back in as soon as we could at about 5:30 and an excellent dive. We saw the same cuttle fish again but then went the other way on the reef. The amount of fish activity at this time as the sun was setting was incredible. There were big schools moving about all over the place. We did not need to move far along the reef but could just hang in about 6 - 7m and watch it all going on around us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Doing the late afternoon dive meant an earlier finish than the last couple of nights. Had another very good meal and were back in the cabin by 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd December</span>
            The last diving day of the trip. We were moored at Wilson's Reef by the time we had breakfast so the first dive was just after 7:00. Between 10:00 and 13:30, there was an "open deck" meaning you could do one or two dives at whatever time you wanted as long as you were back on the surface by 13:30. We chose to dive at 10:00 and again at 12:10 to get in the third dive of the day
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was to and from the back of the boat. We swam with the current for the first part of the dive and had to come back to the boat into it. Not the best way of doing things but there seemed to be more fish on that side of the site. The area round where the boat was moored was about the best part of the site with lots of caves and swim-throughs. The second and third dives were with the dinghys. The second was a fast drift but by the time of the third, the current had dropped and it was more of a gentle swim.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-155.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">All three dives were very good and it was a nice way to end the trip. Loads of bumpheads throughout the dives and several Napoleon wrasse swimming around in the shallows. We saw sharks on the first and third and Roz saw another turtle on the first.The coral through out the site was once again excellent with large table coral all over it and spectacular coral structures in the top 10m.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once the third dive was over, we washed our gear and hung it up on the sun deck to dry. I spent most of the rest of the afternoon editing photos. The boat stopped at an island on the way back South where we had the option to go ashore and look at Aboriginal paintings. Roz went, I could not be bothered.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At 6pm it was the start of the last night bar-b-q/party. We were all given glasses of sparkling wine on the outside seating area while one of the crew got the bar-b-q going. We had a couple more drinks while the captain entertained us with his guitar before we moved inside to eat. After eating, we had the results of the photo competition. I won the compact camera competition with my photo of a cuttle fish laying eggs!! We had another couple of drinks while watching the trip DVD but were still back in the cabin before 11. It was a nice evening and a good way to end the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Overall, this has been a very good trip. We are still very disappointed about the turtles but everything else has been brilliant. Both the dive crew and the rest of the boat crew have been excellent and very friendly. The food has been better than on any live-aboard we have ever been on and although we were in a budget room, it was comfortable enough with good air-con. The other guests were all good to talk to despite being mainly American! The turtles were our main reason for coming here but the whole trip has still been very enjoyable.
