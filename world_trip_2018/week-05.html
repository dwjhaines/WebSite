            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 18th June - 21:00 Tunisia v England</span>
            By now, I probably should not get over excited about watching England play but I was wide awake by 6:30 and could not get back to sleep. Apart from breakfast and a trip to the supermarket over the road, we spent the morning in the room sorting out e-mails, photos, etc
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 12:30 and walked back into the centre. We had a walk around the main square which is still being rebuilt and then went for lunch and our first beer of the day. After eating we went into the Fan Fest. We normally avoid these where-ever possible but there were not that many bars in the area and the setting of this one made it worth visiting. There is a huge wide set of steps leading up form the river to the town. They have set up the big screen by the river so people can sit on the steps to watch games. Most of the Fan Fests have no seating so this is a big improvement. Also, the beer was reasonably priced so we stayed in there for most of the Sweden v South Korea game.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-030.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from the Fan Fest to the Irish pub where Mick and Thomas were but they had moved on by the time we arrived. We had one in there and then spent about an hour in a kebab restaurant near the station. We had only called in for a drink but the food looked good and it was a lot cheaper than trying to get anything at the ground.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The atmosphere around the centre was good although England fans were probably outnumbered by Tunisians by about 10 to 1. We knew that there were not going to be that many of our fans out here as it is the hardest place to get to out of the three venues we play at but were still quite surprised how few there were around. It was even easy to get served in the Irish Bar!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed to the ground earlier than usual. There have been a lot of reports of strict security checks at the turnstiles and we did not leave it to the last minute as we usually do. There were free buses from the station that dropped us about a mile from the ground. We got through the security reasonably quickly and had time to walk completely round the ground before taking our seats about 30 minutes before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game was very enjoyable. There was a good atmosphere and no sign of any trouble despite there being a lot of Russians and Tunisians in the England end. Scoring the winner in injury time was the perfect way to win the game and the ideal end to what had been a very good day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed in the ground to applaud the players and then walked back to the hotel. We were back in the hotel about an hour after the final whistle.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-031.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th June</span>
            We were up by 8:00, had breakfast and went over to the supermarket again for provisions for our next train journey. We checked out of the hotel at 9:00 and got a taxi to the train station. We have a 24 hour journey back to Moscow and will then spend a lot of tomorrow traveling to Suzdal, where we will stay for three nights (Suzdal is just about en-route to Nizhny Novgorad where England play their next game on Sunday). The train left on time at 10:20. We have an identical compartment to last time, this time sharing with a Russian couple.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">The journey back to Moscow was three hours longer than the first journey and this appears to be due to long stops at some of the stations for no apparent reason. The air-con was turned off at all these stops which was not ideal but apart from that it was a comfortable enough journey again. This was one of the free football trains (probably the only time we will use these) so just about everyone on the train had been to the game last night. Most passengers were Russian but there were quite a few English and Tunisian fans as well so a few more people to talk to than on the way down. This train had a restaurant car that did look as if it was likely to have all night vodka drinking sessions in it but it was not air-conditioned and not particularly pleasant.  We stayed mainly in and around our compartment and made do with takeaway food from Volgograd and a supply of pot noodles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Again the day passed reasonably quickly. The only real disadvantage to traveling on the trains is that we don't get to watch the football. We missed Portugal v Spain on the way down and missed Russia winning against Egypt tonight. Most of the train, including the Tunisians seemed to get quite excited about this result!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th June</span>
            Woke at about 7:30 after another good night's sleep. The train arrived on time back in Moscow Paveleckaia at 10:38. All Russian trains run on time. The drivers and staff lose money if they don't!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had to get the metro to Moscow Kurskaia which was only a couple of stops away. Again we had a bit of confusion with the Cyrillic alphabet but still got there without too many problems. We got to Kurskaia by 11:30 so had a two and a half hour wait for the train to Vladimir. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch and took it in turn to wander round the souvenir shops. World Cup merchandise is a lot cheaper if bought in small shops or supermarkets compared to the overpriced stuff in the official FIFA shops. We were on the platform by 13:20 and the train pulled in as usual exactly 30 minutes before departure and left on time at 14:00. Our train's final destination was Nizhny Novgorad where Argentina play tomorrow night so it was full of their fans. However we had reserved seats so once again it was a comfortable journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Vladimir (on time) at 15:38. We walked across the road to the bus station and bought tickets for the 16:30 bus to Suzdal (about ₽100 each). The journey took about 45 minutes. We had to pay another ₽17 to stay on the same bus to get from the bus station into the centre of Suzdal and then had a 10 minute walk to the Panorama Guest House.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Suzdal is one of the "Golden Ring" of cities North East of Moscow. The cities have been described as open-air museums with plenty of churches and monuments to visit and we have a room booked here for the next three nights. As the name of our guest house suggests, we have a balcony with a view of the area. Mainly trees but we have a great view of the Kremlin and we can see quite a few of the churches.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a beer on our balcony while the Uruguay v Saudi Arabia game was on before it got too cold and we had to move into the room. We were about to go out when we discovered a photo of us had made it onto the front page of The Times website. We had been chatting to the photographer on the train while he took photos but were not really expecting to see the photo, let alone see it on the front page of their site. This delayed going out for a while as we made sure that everyone was told about it! (full article: <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/in-pictures-fans-take-the-slow-train-to-moscow-tnv79d50q" target="_blank">Fans take the slow train to Moscow</a>)
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

                src="images/WT2018-032.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into the centre of Suzdal for the Spain v Iran game. The first place we found brewed its own German style beers and was showing the football. The food was not great but the beer was excellent (and cheaper if you bought it by the litre!) so we stayed there until the end of the game. We got back to the hotel and sat on the balcony with another drink. As we are so far North and getting towards the longest day, it never really got completely dark and at midnight, the sky behind the Kremlin was still lit up by the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st June</span>
            Started the day with a huge breakfast at the hotel. We were given more food than we could have possibly eaten including traditional Russian breakfast items such as porridge and pancakes as well as bread, meat and cheese.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-033.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot all morning apart from washing clothes and looking into options for later in the tournament. It is quite difficult to sort anything out as we need totally different plans for England finishing first or second in the group or of course getting knocked out. Starting to realise that finishing second would make our lives a lot easier but still can not really book anything until we know for sure.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We went out to look around Suzdal at about midday. Again, the sights here are not too spectacular but it is a really nice place to walk round. We went to the Kremlin and the nearby market place. Quite a lot of tourists around but mainly Russians. The World Cup does not seem to have had too big an impact on Suzdal! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We watched the Australia v Denmark game in the room at 3:00 and then had a very similar evening to yesterday. We sat on our balcony with a couple of beers instead of watching France v Peru and returned to the same bar as yesterday for Argentina v Croatia. Another poor meal compensated for by the excellent beer. Had a final beer of the day sat on the balcony again looking at the night sky above the Kremlin
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd June</span>
            Another big breakfast followed by a couple of hours sight-seeing. The two biggest sights here after the Kremlin are a monastery and a convent, both about a mile or so from where we are staying. We walked to the monastery first. We only saw this from the outside as the ticket price had gone up from about ₽70 wen our guide book was written to ₽400 now. Previously you had been able to buy a cheap ticket to get inside the walls to walk around the various buildings. Now you have to buy an all-inclusive that includes entry into the museums that we did not really have any interest in.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-034.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from there to the convent. We got inside the walls of this one (free entry) but were both in shorts so did not go into any of churches. Plenty of onion domed buildings to photograph so all nice enough to walk around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the hotel to find a plumber doing minor repairs that had involved dismantling half of our bathroom. We waited on the balcony while he finished. The only things that appeared to be fixed are the towel rail and a minor leak from the cistern so still not really sure what he was doing for so long. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch on our balcony again before watching Brazil v Costa Rica in the room although I fell asleep through a lot of this. Had another similar evening. We sat on our balcony with a couple of drinks and did not see much of Nigeria v Iceland. We returned to Max Brau for the Serbia v Switzerland game. This time, we both had good meals but they had no draught beer. Their bottled beer was no-where as good and was more expensive so we left at half time and watched the second half back in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23nd June</span>
            A slightly earlier start today. We were up by 7:30, had breakfast at 8:00 and left the hotel at 8:30. It has been excellent staying here for a few days. The view from the balcony, although not that impressive when we arrived, has been superb at night with the lit up buildings and the still light sky. We had planned to walk into Suzdal and get a bus out to the bus station to get back to Vladimir but the woman who owned or managed the hotel seemed to think a taxi to the bus station was a better idea. She has also been brilliant during our stay. She must be in her late sixties and does not speak a word of English but she runs the place on her own and is constantly talking into her smart phone which translates what she is saying into English for us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The taxi turned up 15 minutes late at 8:45. The driver was given a torrent of abuse from the owner for the late arrival but got us out the bus station in time for the 9:00 bus to Vladimir. The seats had sold out by the time we got there but we were able to get tickets to stand and Roz somehow managed to get a seat anyway in the end. By 9:45 we were back at Vladimir train station with a 90 minute wait for the train to Nizhny Novgorod where England play their second game tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The train left on time at 11:16. We met up with Steve on the train. He arrived in Moscow yesterday so had got on the train there. We had booked three seats from Vladimir and he had been able to book the same seat all the way from Moscow. The train arrived in Nizhny at about 1:40.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had had problems getting anywhere to stay in Nizhny Novgorod and had ended up at some sort of sports complex about ten miles out of town. Despite the cost of the taxis, this worked out a lot cheaper than staying in a more central location. We got a taxi out there from the station for about £6. I had installed a Russian taxi app on my phone which we had seen other people using. We were a bit unsure whether or not it would work but the first attempt went relatively smoothly. It means taxis are a lot cheaper than if we get them from taxi ranks and is a lot easier than trying to phone up to get  one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The sports complex was a strange place. It seems like some sort of activity centre for teenagers so there is  a lot going on such as paint-balling, assault courses, etc. The accommodation is very basic and does not have air-con (temperature when we arrived about 35°c) but should be fine for a couple of nights. As usual, everything is spotlessly clean and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-035.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the restaurant while watching the first half of the Belgium v Tunisia game and watched the second half in the bar (the restaurant was taken over by a "graduation disco" at 4:00 and we were advised to move somewhere quieter!). As soon as this game had finished, we got another taxi into town. We were all very impressed with the taxi app. Taxis appear within a couple of minutes of being ordered and cost very little money.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were dropped by the river near the Kremlin and spent an hour or so climbing up to it and walking around inside it. It is  bigger and more spectacular than the one in Suzdal and also had excellent views of the city and the football stadium. We walked down to the river again and found a restaurant to watch the Mexico v South Korea game (the craft beer place that we had planned to go to did not have a television and did not look that good anyway). We did not eat there but got another taxi straight after the game to an Italian restaurant that was recommended in Lonely Planet and Free Lions.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went from there to another bar in the main pedestrian area to watch the third game of the day, Germany v Sweden. We had a few problems with the taxi app on the way home. The taxi driver could not find us so rang me to see where we were. That conversation did not go well but I handed my phone to a group of Russians standing near us and they told the driver where we were and he appeared about a minute later. Once again, people her are all incredibly helpful and friendly. Back at the complex, there is a large balcony/terrace type thing near the rooms with good views of the city. We had a final beer there and got to bed at about 1:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 24th June - 15:00 England v Panama</span>
            Not the best of starts to the day. We had a poor breakfast in the restaurant and then tried to get a taxi into town. My app could not find any taxis. It kept saying there was high demand and not enough taxis. There were other fans staying in the same place so there about seven of us trying to get in. Uber, which other people were using, was having the same problem as my app. Eventually one of the girls who works here and speaks perfect English managed to phone up and get two taxis and we were all in the centre by about 11:00. We sat in the park at Gorky Square eating take-aways and then walked the length of the pedestrianised area to pick up our Free Lions from outside the fan fest.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">It was time for a beer by now and we got a table in one of the first bars we came to back in the pedestrianised street. However, it took 30 minutes for the waitress to bring us the wrong drinks and try and overcharge us. I don't think she was deliberately trying to rip us off, they were just struggling to cope with the number of people around. We gave up, left and headed to the ground.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-036.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to walk to the ground but the bridge we would have walked over was closed to pedestrians which just about forced us onto the shuttle buses. It was only a five minute walk to where the buses left from and there were no queues this early so we were near the ground before 1:00. The day started to get better after this!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of beers before kick-off. Although the beer is over-priced Budwiser it was very hot again and we needed something to drink. The game went better than we could have hoped for. Very nice to be in the position of having qualified with a game to spare so we can relax for a few days while watching other teams trying to qualify.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had no desire to queue to get on the free transport to get back into the centre straight after the game. On the way to the ground we had seen a craft beer bar about 5 minutes away. It was not that obvious from the outside that it was a bar so there were not that many people in it considering its location. It was crowded and did eventually run out of beer but we were able to get a table and have a couple of beers while the crowds dispersed a bit.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got straight onto a shuttle bus when we left the bar and returned to the place we had ended up in last night. We ate in there and stayed for the 9:00 game, Poland v Columbia. We got a taxi back to the hotel (the app worked perfectly again this time) and went for another drink on the terrace. Tonight, there was an English bloke there with his Russian wife and her family. They had bought too much beer and vodka and were keen on us helping them finish it all! Got to bed sometime after 2:00.
