            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 18th June - 21:00 Tunisia v England</span>
            By now, I probably should not get over excited about watching England play but I was wide awake by 6:30 and could not get back to sleep. Apart from breakfast and a trip to the supermarket over the road, we spent the morning in the room sorting out e-mails, photos, etc
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at about 12:30 and walked back into the centre. We had a walk around the main square which is still being rebuilt and then went for lunch and our first beer of the day. After eating we went into the Fan Fest. We normally avoid these where-ever possible but there were not that many bars in the area and the setting of this one made it worth visiting. There is a huge wide set of steps leading up form the river to the town. They have set up the big screen by the river so people can sit on the steps to watch games. Most of the Fan Fests have no seating so this is a big improvement. Also, the beer was reasonably priced so we stayed in there for most of the Sweden v South Korea game.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-030.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from the Fan Fest to the Irish pub where Mick and Thomas were but they had moved on by the time we arrived. We had one in there and then spent about an hour in a kebab restaurant near the station. We had only called in for a drink but the food looked good and it was a lot cheaper than trying to get anything at the ground.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The atmosphere around the centre was good although England fans were probably outnumbered by Tunisians by about 10 to 1. We knew that there were not going to be that many of our fans out here as it is the hardest place to get to out of the three venues we play at but were still quite surprised how few there were around. It was even easy to get served in the Irish Bar!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed to the ground earlier than usual. There have been a lot of reports of strict security checks at the turnstiles and we did not leave it to the last minute as we usually do. There were free buses from the station that dropped us about a mile from the ground. We got through the security reasonably quickly and had time to walk completely round the ground before taking our seats about 30 minutes before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game was very enjoyable. There was a good atmosphere and no sign of any trouble despite there being a lot of Russians and Tunisians in the England end. Scoring the winner in injury time was the perfect way to win the game and the ideal end to what had been a very good day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed in the ground to applaud the players and then walked back to the hotel. We were back in the hotel about an hour after the final whistle.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-031.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th June</span>
            We were up by 8:00, had breakfast and went over to the supermarket again for provisions for our next train journey. We checked out of the hotel at 9:00 and got a taxi to the train station. We have a 24 hour journey back to Moscow and will then spend a lot of tomorrow traveling to Suzdal, where we will stay for three nights (Suzdal is just about en-route to Nizhny Novgorad where England play their next game on Sunday). The train left on time at 10:20. We have an identical compartment to last time, this time sharing with a Russian couple.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">The journey back to Moscow was three hours longer than the first journey and this appears to be due to long stops at some of the stations for no apparent reason. The air-con was turned off at all these stops which was not ideal but apart from that it was a comfortable enough journey again. This was one of the free football trains (probably the only time we will use these) so just about everyone on the train had been to the game last night. Most passengers were Russian but there were quite a few English and Tunisian fans as well so a few more people to talk to than on the way down. This train had a restaurant car that did look as if it was likely to have all night vodka drinking sessions in it but it was not air-conditioned and not particularly pleasant.  We stayed mainly in and around our compartment and made do with takeaway food from Volgograd and a supply of pot noodles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Again the day passed reasonably quickly. The only real disadvantage to traveling on the trains is that we don't get to watch the football. We missed Portugal v Spain on the way down and missed Russia winning against Egypt tonight. Most of the train, including the Tunisians seemed to get quite excited about this result!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th June</span>
            Woke at about 7:30 after another good night's sleep. The train arrived on time back in Moscow Paveleckaia at 10:38. All Russian trains run on time. The drivers and staff lose money if they don't!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had to get the metro to Moscow Kurskaia which was only a couple of stops away. Again we had a bit of confusion with the Cyrillic alphabet but still got there without too many problems. We got to Kurskaia by 11:30 so had a two and a half hour wait for the train to Vladimir. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch and took it in turn to wander round the souvenir shops. World Cup merchandise is a lot cheaper if bought in small shops or supermarkets compared to the overpriced stuff in the official FiFA shops. We were on the platform by 13:20 and the train pulled in as usual exactly 30 minutes before departure and left on time at 14:00. Our train's final destination was Nizhny Novgorad where Argentina play tomorrow night so it was full of their fans. However we had reserved seats so once again it was a comfortable journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Vladimir (on time) at 15:38. We walked across the road to the bus station and bought tickets for the 16:30 bus to Suzdal (about ₽100 each). The journey took about 45 minutes. We had to pay another ₽17 to stay on the same bus to get from the bus station into the centre of Suzdal and then had a 10 minute walk to the Panorama Guest House.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Suzdal is one of the "Golden Ring" of cities North East of Moscow. The cities have been described as open-air museums with plenty of churches and monuments to visit and we have a room booked here for the next three nights. As the name of our guest house suggests, we have balcony with a view of the area. Mainly trees but we have a great view of the Kremlin and can see quite a few of the churches.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a beer on our balcony while the Uruguay v Saudi Arabia game was on before it got too cold and we had to move into the room. We were about to go out when we discovered a photo of us had made it onto the front page of The Times website. We had been chatting to the photographer on the train while he took photos but were not really expecting to see the photo, let alone see it on the front page of their site. This delayed going out for a while as we made sure that everyone was told about it!

            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We walked back into the centre of Suzdal for the Spain v Iran game. The first place we found brewed its own German style beers and was showing the football. The food was not great but the beer was excellent (and cheaper if you bought it by the litre!) so we stayed there until the end of the game. We got back to the hotel and sat on the balcony with another drink. As we are so far North and getting towards the longest day, it never really got completely dark and at midnight, the sky behind the Kremlin was still lit up by the sun.
