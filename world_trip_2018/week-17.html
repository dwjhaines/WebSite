            Out on the bikes again this morning after breakfast. We went south again and did just over ten miles. The bike route South of Rovinj is very scenic as it goes right along the coast but is also very slow. A lot of it is not surfaced and you are also sharing the path with pedestrians making it impossible to go to quickly. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When we got back, we were taken to look at another apartment just round the corner from here we are staying. This belongs to a friend of the owner of the apartment we are currently in and is available for three nights from Wednesday. The apartment looked as nice as the one we are in and is the same price so we will move there on Wednesday morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an early lunch and walked down to the dive centre just after 1:00. We have dived in Croatia before and as with previous times, it was a very laid back dive operation. There were no forms to fill in and not too much in the way of information, we were just given our equipment, put it together and got on the boat. There was a short briefing before jumping into the water and that was it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive was not great. The water was not as clear as when we have dived here before and there was not a lot to see. However, the equipment was all OK, it was not too cold and it was good to be diving again. The dive was only 46 minutes and the site not far away so we were back at the dive centre not long after 3:00. We washed out our equipment and walked back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we walked into the old town and bought take-away kebabs.
