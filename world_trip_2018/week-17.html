            Out on the bikes again this morning after breakfast. We went south again and did just over ten miles. The bike route South of Rovinj is very scenic as it goes right along the coast but is also very slow. A lot of it is not surfaced and you are also sharing the path with pedestrians making it impossible to go to quickly. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When we got back, we were taken to look at another apartment just round the corner from here we are staying. This belongs to a friend of the owner of the apartment we are currently in and is available for three nights from Wednesday. The apartment looked as nice as the one we are in and is the same price so we will move there on Wednesday morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an early lunch and walked down to the dive centre just after 1:00. We have dived in Croatia before and as with previous times, it was a very laid back dive operation. There were no forms to fill in and not too much in the way of information, we were just given our equipment, put it together and got on the boat. There was a short briefing before jumping into the water and that was it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dive was not great. The water was not as clear as when we have dived in Croatia before and there was not a lot to see. However, the equipment was all OK, it was not too cold and it was good to be diving again. The dive was only 46 minutes and the site not far away so we were back at the dive centre not long after 3:00. We washed out our equipment and walked back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">In the evening, we walked into the old town and bought take-away kebabs.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 11th September</span>
            We were at the dive centre by 9:00 for todays dive at the Baron Gautsch wreck, one of Croatia's most famous dives. We got our gear sorted out again and were on our way by 9:30. It took about 30 minutes to get to the dive site and we were in the water not long after 10:00
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Once again, it was a slightly disappointing dive. I had read that the visibility was not as good in this part of the Adriatic as it is further South but I was not expecting it to be so much worse. As well as the poor vis, the top of the wreck is at 28m so by the time you are down to it, you only have about 16 - 17 minutes of bottom time left. There is nothing to see once you start the ascent so for all the effort of getting there, we only really had a 16 minute dive in poor vis.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-101.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The wreck itself was very good and it was all an enjoyable enough way of spending the morning. It was just not really worth the time and money involved for the amount of time underwater. We had considered doing five or six dives here but were both in agreement that we should stop after this one. If this was the best dive site, we were not really interested in paying to see the others. We will have much better diving to come starting from next month!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I cycled to Lidl to get bread for lunch and after eating, we both cycled out to one of the "beaches" South of the old town. There are plenty of places along the coast which are not really beaches but areas where the rocks are flat enough for sun-bathing and it is easy to get in the water. I stayed for just over an hour before returning to the apartment to listen to the end of the final test. Roz stayed for about another hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had not planned on drinking anything in the evening but ended up having a few glasses of wine on our terrace. We ate at Pizzeria Leone again. Got back to the apartment and carried on drinking while watching England v Switzerland on the tablet.

            We had to move apartments this morning. We packed up our stuff and drove about 50m to where we will be staying for the next three days. Not quite as much space as where we have just come from but still more than enough and we have a bigger terrace. We spent the rest of the morning booking a couple of places to stay in Germany and Belgium for our journey home. Had leftover pizza on the terrace for lunch.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, we went out on our bikes again. Roz went to the beach and cycled 13 miles. I cycled to Bale, about 12 miles away. It is small town with a castle and a couple of churches that were reasonably interesting to wander around for 20 minutes or so.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Had another evening like yesterdays. i.e. a few glasses of wine on the balcony (and my first beer for over five weeks) before walking into the old town for another pizza.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th September</span>
            Spent a couple of hours wandering round the old town again in the morning. We went up to look around the cathedral at the top of the hill and also spent a bit of time wandering round the souvenir shops that fill the old town.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After pizza leftovers for lunch, I joined Roz on a repeat of her 13 mile bike ride down the coast, ending up at the same place we had stopped two days ago. We spent an hour or so in the sun before cycling back to the apartment. Another very similar evening. We had a few drinks on the terrace before walking back into town. We had been looking at restaurants earlier and found one just on the edge of the old town that was cheaper than the ones in the old town itself. We had a pretty good meal before walking back for a few more drinks in the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 14th September</span>
            We spent most of the morning lazing around on the terrace. I went out on my bike at midday mainly to get bread for lunch which was also eaten on the terrace. After lunch, I cycled to Bale again before joining Roz back at the usual spot on the beach. It meant that I cycled over 40 miles today, more than on any day since the World Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were relatively late getting back to the apartment. We did not have drinks before going out tonight but went straight into the Old Town. We had our final pizza at Pizzeria Leone with half a litre of wine before walking back to the apartment for an early night
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th September</span>
            I was wide awake by 7:00 so went out and did another 20 miles on my bike. The cycling round here has been very enjoyable. Although there are no dedicated cycle paths, the roads are not too busy, motorists seem quite considerate towards cyclists (mainly because a lot of them are German or Austrian) and the hills are not too steep. It is also starting to get cooler which makes things a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We packed up the car and left the apartment just before 11:00. We have both really enjoyed the week in Rovinj despite not doing as much diving as we had planned to. The accommodation in both apartments has been really good, the food has been excellent and the wine from the supermarket good and cheap. Having our bikes here has meant that it has been easy to get out to some of the better places to sunbathe and to get around without having to use the car. All in all, a very good week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The drive to Pula was easy enough and took less than an hour with a stop at Lidl on the way to stock up on wine. We found Villa Gregovica without any problems and although we had been told that we could not check in until 14:00, the apartment was ready about 10 minutes after we arrived. It took about half an hour for the owners to go into great deal about what there was to see and do in the area but by 13:00 they had taken our money and left us alone. It is another nice place with three bedrooms (Aleks and Andi fly out from England later) and a small swimming pool in the back garden.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After finishing the end of last nights pizza, we went out to have a quick look at the old town and to visit the Pula aquarium. We are staying about 1.4 miles from the main sight here, the Roman amphitheatre. I think it is the sixth biggest Roman arena in the world and one of the most complete. We only had a quick look at it as we cycled past - we will revisit it properly later in our stay here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued from there another 3.5 miles to the aquarium. This does not have the reputation of being one of the best aquariums in the world but we had wanted to visit it when we discovered there was a turtle rehabilitation centre there. As it was the turtle section was a bit sad with just two injured and not very happy looking turtles swimming around in quite small containers. The rest of the aquarium was better than expected, particularly the seahorses and the juvenile cuttle fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We cycled back to the apartment in time for the afternoon's football and found that some Eastern European channel was showing Swansea v Forest so we were able to watch it on my tablet. It was a poor 0 - 0 draw that we watched while following Sunderland's defeat at Burton. A thrilling couple of hours!
