            We arrived on time at Heathrow at about 05:30. We had a bit of a delay waiting for my luggage as it was one of the last things to appear but we were through the airport about an hour later. Aleks and Andi were waiting to meet us when we came through and drove us back to Farnborough. After breakfast, I collected my car and we drove back to Kingsclere.

            Visited Aunty Jean in the morning. I went out on my bike again from there and did another 18 miles. We drove to Harrogate after lunch and checked into The Cairn Hotel for two nights. After cycling out to a couple of pubs, we went for a Wetherspoons curry followed by a Cask Marque pub crawl.

            11:00 train from Harrogate to Newcastle via York. We had a few beers in Newcastle before getting another train down to Sunderland for the Sunderland v Doncaster game at 5:30. A few problems with late trains on the way back ending up with Northern Rail getting us a taxi from York to Harrogate as we had missed our connection. Back in Harrogate just before midnight.
