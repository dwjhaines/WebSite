            In many ways, a similar Christmas Eve to ones at home. We started by walking to Tesco to stock up on alcohol, Christmas lights (reduced to 50p), chocolate and other junk food. Bangkok Tesco not quite as busy as Newbury Tesco on Christmas Eve! Next stop was Boots to get more antibiotic cream. The pharmacist seemed to think we needed somthing stronger than the cream we had bought in Bali. We were then in the MBK shopping centre for an hour or so trying to find things to buy as last minute presents. This all seemed to take most of the day but by 4pm we were back in the apartment with lights up and presents wrapped.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Bangkok is a lot more Christmassy than Amed and Tulamben. There are decorations up in all the shops and Christmas music playing just about everywhere you go. We had considered spending Christmas in Amed or Tulamben and were a bit unsure about coming to Bangkok but it has been a good move. There were hardly any people staying in either of those places which was fine when we were diving but it would have meant a very quiet Christmas. At least here it does feel like Christmas, albeit a bit hotter than normal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At MBK, I managed to buy Love Actually on DVD and we watched that with a few glasses of wine before going out for the evening. We went out at about 8:00 and stopped first at Feat Lab for a drink. This is a craft beer bar that had opened the last time we were in Bangkok but we had not really paid much attention to it for some reason. It turned out to be an excellent place and we had the best beer we have had since leaving home in October. Will be back for happy hour tomorrow!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from there to Siam Square and Ban Khun Mae, one of our favourite restaurants anywhere. We had an excellent meal there with a bobble of Sang Som and got back to the hotel just before midnight.
