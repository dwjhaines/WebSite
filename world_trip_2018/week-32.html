            In many ways, a similar Christmas Eve to ones at home. We started by walking to Tesco to stock up on alcohol, Christmas lights (reduced to 50p), chocolate and other junk food. Bangkok Tesco not quite as busy as Newbury Tesco on Christmas Eve! Next stop was Boots to get more antibiotic cream. The pharmacist seemed to think we needed somthing stronger than the cream we had bought in Bali. We were then in the MBK shopping centre for an hour or so trying to find things to buy as last minute presents. This all seemed to take most of the day but by 4pm we were back in the apartment with lights up and presents wrapped.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Bangkok is a lot more Christmassy than Amed and Tulamben. There are decorations up in all the shops and Christmas music playing just about everywhere you go. We had considered spending Christmas in Amed or Tulamben and were a bit unsure about coming to Bangkok but it has been a good move. There were hardly any people staying in either of those places which was fine when we were diving but it would have meant a very quiet Christmas. At least here it does feel like Christmas, albeit a bit hotter than normal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At MBK, I managed to buy Love Actually on DVD and we watched that with a few glasses of wine before going out for the evening. We went out at about 8:00 and stopped first at Feat Lab for a drink. This is a craft beer bar that had opened the last time we were in Bangkok but we had not really paid much attention to it for some reason. It turned out to be an excellent place and we had the best beer we have had since leaving home in October. Will be back for happy hour tomorrow!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from there to Siam Square and Ban Khun Mae, one of our favourite restaurants anywhere. We had an excellent meal there with a bobble of Sang Som and got back to the hotel just before midnight.

            We did not do a lot all morning. We have breakfast included with our room so did not need to go out to eat. We had an hour or so by the pool at midday and then walked down to MBK for lunch. We had joked when we first started thinking about Bangkok for Christmas that it would mean Christmas lunch at MBK. MBK is a shopping centre with a food court on the sixth floor and we eat lunch there just about every day we are in Bangkok. Our Christmas lunch consisted of seafood fried rice and banana milkshakes. An excellent if slightly un-traditional Christmas meal.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the apartment, we made our phone calls home at about 4ish and then started on the wine wile we opened our presents. Things didn't really go to plan after that. We had planned to go to Feat Lab for one or two before walking to Ban Khun Mae to eat. We were then due to meet Kevin in a British pub a few stops away on the sky train at 9pm. However, Feat Lab was having some sort of party which involved an all night happy hour and prize draws with every drink purchase. The beer I was drinking last night was not on but they had a 6.9% IPA which went down far too smoothly. One or two turned into quite a lot more and we ended up deciding not to bother going to eat. With every drink you won either a free half pint, a glass or a portion of chips so we just about had enough food to keep us going. Kevin came and joined us at about 8:45 and we stayed there until it closed at 11:00. Neither of us clearly remember leaving or walking back to the hotel. Excellent session!

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th December</span>
            Woke up regretting drinking so much of the 6.9% IPA and remained hungover for the rest of the day. Having one or two pints of beer that strong would have been OK but drinking it all night was probably not a good idea. We mad it down to breakfast but spent the rest of the morning in bed. We went out at about 3. We had a few things we wanted to buy and also needed to post another parcel of things home. Everything seemed to take a long time and we were not helped by the fact that Roz had to go back to the hotel for her passport before we could post the parcel. We did not feel like eating Thai food so had burgers for lunch before walking back to the hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had arranged to meet Kevin again in a rooftop bar for sunset but it was getting late by the time we were back and neither of us were too enthusiastic about going out, and drinking again certainly did not appeal. We canceled that and had another couple of hours recovering before going out to eat. We did make it out to Ban Khun Mae this time and managed to stay away from Feat Lab and were back in the apartment by 9pm.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th December</span>
            We checked out of Evergreen Apartments just before 8:00 and got a taxi out to the airport. Traffic was a lot better this morning and we at the airport in about 30 minutes. Check-in and immigration was not too bad and we were at the gate with abut an hour to spare for our 10:30 flight to Manila. The flight left about half an hour late which did not really matter as we have a six hour stop-over in Manila before another flight to Cebu this evening.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We landed in Manila at 3ish local time. We cleared immigration and then had to collect our luggage, carry it through customs and then drop it off again the other side. Before going back through to departures, we bought another SIM card as we had a few things to sort out and the WiFi was not great. While we were waiting to go through, we got an email saying that the ferry that we were planning to catch tomorrow morning was possibly going to be canceled due to the weather. Apparently, there is a Signal 1 Typhoon warning for the Southern Leyte region whatever that means. We exchanged a few e-mails some of which were not very clear but we eventually established that all ferries to Southern Leyte were likely to be canceled tomorrow so it is looking like an extra night in Cebu. This is not ideal but probably not the end of the world either. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All this plus making a couple of payments for our February diving meant that the time at the airport went fairly quickly. Our flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 but again was about 30 minutes late. We arrived in Cebu City at about 10pm and were relieved to get our luggage fairly quickly. Getting a meter taxi was also straightforward and and we were in our hotel just after 11. The hotel is very basic compared to the last but we had anticipated only being in it for about 6 hours as we were planning on getting a ferry at 6am tomorrow.

            A frustrating day! We still did not really know what was going on with the ferries so checked out of the hotel at about 9:30 and got a taxi to the port. We were fairly sure we needed to go to Pier 3 to enquire about a midday ferry to Bohol (which would at least get us part of the way to Leyte) but the hotel receptionist told us to go to Pier 1. He was wrong. We then had a 500m walk with all our luggage which is not that easy to carry any great distance. About half way along we decided it would be easier if Roz went ahead to find ticket information while I waited with the luggage. She came back 20 minutes or so later with the news that there was no midday ferry to Bohol. Most places we travel now, it is very easy to get transport schedules and up-to-date information from the internet but Philippine ferries do not seem to have caught up with that yet. After a bit more research, we gave up on the Bohol idea and I went off to find out about the 12:00 Roble ferry tomorrow. I was told at the office that it was "50-50" whether or not this would be going. It appears that once a signal 1 warning is in place, ships are not allowed into the area until the signal is "lifted" by the coastguard and no-one knows yet when this will happen.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Once we had established that we were not going anywhere today, we looked at a few places on Booking.com and got a taxi out to a tower block that has a few apartments listed. We got there and were offered one for the night on the 52nd floor for under £30. This seemed a very good deal as the tower block was a modern, quite smart looking building. The apartment was not ready for us but we were told we could put our luggage in there and wait for it to be cleaned. Inside it was a bit disappointing. For such a modern building, the apartment looked like something from Eastern Europe in the early nineties and is about a quarter of the size of the one we had in Bangkok. Fine again for one night though.

            <p class="diary-text">We went out for a couple of hours while the apartment was cleaned. We went to Burger King for a late breakfast/lunch and wandered round a couple of shopping malls. Cebu City has absolutely nothing to offer for the tourist and is not an ideal place to get stuck. We returned to the apartment to find that the WiFi does not work. At least the views are good and we were able to look out of the window and watch ferries departing for everywhere other than Southern Leyte. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We exchanged a few more e-mails with Peter's Dive Resort and found out that there will be no ferries going tomorrow either. We spent the rest of the afternoon looking for alternative plans but there are not too many other options. We could change our plans completely and go to Leyte later but most of the other places we could get to are fully booked. We booked what looks to be a better hotel slightly out of town for tomorrow night and will try and go at midday on Sunday. We gave up on this by about 7pm and went out for a pizza. We found a place recommended on the internet and had a really good meal. Back in the room by about 9:00.
