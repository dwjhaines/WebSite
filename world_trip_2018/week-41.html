            All the dives today were at Black Rock, Myanmar's most famous and probably best dive site. Noi did not dive today so it was me Roz and Marshall for the first three dives, although Camile joined us half way through the first of these.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-223.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first three dives were excellent. We had dived here last year and we had seen mantas on all three dives. When we had not been looking at mantas, we had been looking into the blue hoping to see mantas. We had commented at the time that although the mantas were superb, and the highlight of the trip, we were aware that there was a very good dive site with plenty of other things to look at that we were completely ignoring. Today, we did not see any mantas at all so were able to concentrate entirely on the rest of the site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Before we jumped, you could tell that the visibility was going to be better today but we were still surprised at just how clear the water was when we went down. We must have been able to see for about 40 - 50m. The topography of site itself would make dives spectacular here even if there were no fish. One half of the island has a dramatic wall, the other half was sloping after about 20m with huge underwater boulders on the sand. However, once again the whole site was covered in fish. This time as well as all the smaller stuff, there were hunting jacks, travallys and barracuda. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We saw pretty much the same things on all three dives with the highlight being a large school of jacks. We were able to get right in amongst these, particularly on the first dive when they came and completely surrounded us. Julien was looking for more of the smaller stuff on the third dive but we were still able to drift along looking at the fish. Huge schools of bait fish all round the site with plenty of the predators constantly hunting. We saw lots of different species of moray eels and lots of huge scorpion fish all over the site as well as all the usual reef fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was also very good. A lot of the other divers, including Marshall opted to do a sunset dive instead of the night dive. Usually we would do the same but Julien is very keen on night dives so we thought we may as well go in at the usual time. This was our one hundredth night dive and was very good. It was a 71 minute dive along a very colourful wall. There was more crabs and shrimps than usual on night dives as well as all the morays, etc and it was a good end to an excellent days diving. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 26th February</span>
            Another good days diving. We dived three sites all in the same area. It was just me and Roz with Julien for the first dive. For some reason, Marshall has moved to another group and Noi was still not diving. Camille now seems to be diving with Anjie who has left the group that Marshall has joined.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was at Shark Cave. The vis was no-where near as good as yesterday but also no-where near as bad as it was on the first day of the trip. We did actually see a shark in the cave which is quite rare apparently. The main cave was a long swim-through which was a bit narrow but quite spectacular. Plenty of fish throughout the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Submarine. Noi rejoined us for this dive. We were looking for sea-horses on this dive but did not manage to find any. We did find a pineapple fish, the first we had seen since the one at the same site last year. Noi was low on air after about 32 minutes so Roz and I were left on our own to continue the second half of the dive. We did not have enough bottom time to continue our search for sea-horses so drifted along the wall for 30 minutes or so. All nice enough. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-228.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Noi was with us again on the third dive at Square Rock. Julien had a list of things that he was looking for on this dive. He failed to find the frog fish but did find the harlequin shrimps - the first of these that we have seen for a while. He also found a juvenile sea-horse, two ornate ghost pipe-fish and led us to a sleeping hawksbill turtle before taking Noi to the surface. Her air consumption was a lot better on this dive and they were only ten minutes or so ahead of us. Again, there were large amounts of fish all over this site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was definitely one of our better night dives! We dived at Square Rock again and followed the same route as the third dive meaning we saw a lot of the same things. However, this time we did manage to find the small frog-fish at the start of the dive. It was a small yellow frog-fish and quite well blended into the fan it was on meaning that even when we were looking at it, it was hard to tell it was a frog-fish. We saw the harlequin shrimps again and the two ornate ghost pipe fish but also saw three other sea-horses and a starry night octopus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks with dinner for the first time since getting on the boat but it was still a relatively early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 27th February</span>
            This trip is similar to the one we did last year but the one difference is that this year we get to spend a day diving at Burma Banks. This is further West than the Mergui Archipelago where we have been diving and is not somewhere that we have dived before. We had been told that we may not be able to get out there if the weather got bad but after sheltering for a few hours near South Twin, we started traveling West at about 3am.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-229.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived at the dive area just after 6:30. We were the last group to dive today. Noi did not dive at all today so it was just me, Roz and Julien for all four dives. The sea in this area is about 300 - 400m deep with a series of large sandy banks or plateaus rising up to a maximum of about 10m. The depth of the fist bank we dived, Heckford Bank was about 25m. It was another negative entry and straight down to the plateau. The dive was quite enjoyable without being brilliant. The vis was very good but there was not too much to see. It is mainly exploratory diving here again as it is not an area that has been dived much. We did see four sleeping nurse sharks - three under one coral bommie and a fourth under another. Also saw two pairs of long-nose hawk fish. The depth and the fact that we were only on 27% nitrox meant that we were out of bottom time after about 40 minutes. We did drift above the reef for another 10 minutes or so but again there was not too much to see.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at Roe Bank was similar to the first but a couple of metres shallower. It was a nicer dive as there were more fish around. For most of the first half hour we were surrounded by a large school of colourful fusiliers that seemed to be following us. We saw another large nurse shark, this time it was swimming and we also saw another long-nose hawk fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive of the day at "Smiling Seahorse" Bank was the best of the day. It was a shallower site (about 15 - 23m) meaning that we did not have to worry about bottom time or air consumption as much. There were huge schools of fish all over the site. As well as the snapper and fusiliers, there were big schools of butterfly fish as well as the usual reef fish. The current had dropped almost completely so we could just gently drift over the coral watching the fish. I had wondered if it had been worth coming all the way out here for four dives but this dive definitively made it worthwhile.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The fourth dive of the day was in the same place as the third. We went in a bit earlier tonight so it was a sunset/night dive. A few fish around at the start and a few crabs and shrimps at the end but not the best dive of the day and certainly no-where near as good as yesterday's night dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in the evening again. At about 9pm, Everyone went up to the sun deck and Franck turned off all the power on the boat. We then had a perfect view of the night sky totally uninterrupted by any lights. It was a clear night so we had excellent views of the stars and milky way. All very nice. After about 30 minutes of that, we finished our drinks and returned to the cabin
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 28th February</span>
            We were back in The Mergui Archipelago  by the time we woke up. First dive was a Sea Fan Forest. Once again, it was just me, Roz and Julien diving in our group. This was another excellent dive. The site gets its name from the large number of Gorgonian sea fans on the pinnacle. We did not see the main area of sea fans but dived the other side. We saw two big octopus at the start of the dive down at about 30m and then worked our way up the wall. The whole dive was nice but the highlight was probably towards the end in the shallows where again, we could just hang and watch all the fish. There were large schools of small fish being chased by the bigger jacks and travallys.and we spent the last ten minutes of the dive watching it all.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-230.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Second dive was at Eagle Rock and we were joined again by Noi. This was the site where we saw a hawksbill turtle last year, the only one we did see on that trip. Within the first minute of this dive, as we were descending, I spotted the same turtle. We went straight to it and spent about ten minutes watching it. We moved on as she started going up for air but she did not go all the way up. Something changed her mind and she came back and rejoined us hitting Roz on the leg as she came back down. She did eventually go up for air but still came back to us and stayed with us for the first 25 minutes of the dive. The rest of the dive was also very good. I don't know if it is more sunny or if the vis is better but today's sites in particular have been a lot more colourful than I remember them last year and the shallow area at the end of this dive was really nice again. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There are two sites here and half the divers from the boat dived at Western Rocky for their second dive. Franck's group saw a five metre whale shark when they came out of the cave on their dive. When we got back from ours, we went straight back in the water with snorkels for 30 minutes or so but there was no sign of it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived Western Rocky for our third dive. This was very nice again. We swam through the tunnel under the island. Plenty of fish and nudis as well as another sea-horse. More colourful coral and a couple of cuttle fish as we started our safety stop. On both the second and third dives, Julien took Noi up when she was low on air leaving us to complete the dives on our own. We did the night dive in the same place although we just swan round the island and did not go through the tunnel. We gained Dennis on this dive which was a shame. He is Italian and a complete pain both on the boat and underwater. It was still a good night dive with plenty of nudis and a couple of small yellow box fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back on the boat it was bar-b-q night and the last night of the trip. This meant a slightly later night than usual with a few more drinks. A very good evening.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-231.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 1st March</span>
            Up at the usual time for the final dive of the trip. We dived at a site called Volcano. Last year the same site was called Sea-horse City but all the sea-horses have gone so the site has been renamed. Noi joined us for this dive which started in the centre of a lagoon surrounded by a volcanic rim with a small outlet to the sea. Last year, the dive was pretty poor apart from the sea-horses. This time it was a better dive. Not the most spectacular dive of the trip but an easy dive to end on. Saw a few more nudis and a brief sighting of what I thought was an eagle ray right at the end.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We are coming back on the boat on Sunday for a three day trip to Thai dive sites. This meant that we were able to leave all our dive gear in place and leave a lot of our luggage in the cabin. Spent the morning sorting out the remainder of our luggage and downloading photos, videos, etc. We arrived back in Kawthaung at about 1:30. We went to buy a few bottles of Myanmar Rum which is cheaper than alcohol in Thailand and then went to Smile Bar where, as with the previous trip, we had an hour of unlimited beer paid for by Franck. Slightly pissed getting back on the boat!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It took half an hour to get back across to Ranong. It then took a couple of hours to get everyone off the boat and into the taxi, drive to the immigration  office and get all our passports stamped. Once this was done it was back onto the bus and we were driven to the Tinidee hotel. Thankfully, our hotel was the first one that the taxi stopped at and we were in our room just after 5pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out by the time we arrived but decided to carry on drinking anyway. We started on the Myanmar Rum before going out to eat. Some of the people from the boat were meeting for a drink at The Farmhouse but we could not be bothered to walk over there. It was mainly the French people from the boat who were going to be there and we had not really spoken to them much during the trip. We found a restaurant closer to the hotel and ate there before returning to the room and drinking a lot more of the rum than we had planned to.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-232.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 2nd March</span>
            We did not have much to do today. We were late getting up and wandered into the centre of Ranong for breakfast at about midday. We bought plasters and a few things from Tesco and walked back to the hotel. Roz spent the afternoon by the pool while I carried on sorting out photos from the live-aboard.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a similar evening to yesterday. We had a few glasses of our Myanmar Rum before going out to eat. We went back to the same restaurant that we ate in last night and then returned to the room to carry on drinking. We had a couple of hours of following the football and don't clearly remember going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 3rd March</span>
            Another day without a lot to do as we were not due to be picked up by Smiling Seahorse until 5pm. We stayed in the room until checkout at midday, had lunch by the pool and stayed there for the rest of the afternoon. The swimming pool here is quite nice and they also have pools that are fed from the local hot springs so it was not too bad a way of spending the afternoon.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We left the hotel at 3:45 and walked back to The Farmhouse, stopping for roti canai on the way. We had about 10 - 15 minutes to wait outside The Farmhouse before the taxi/bus from Smiling Seahorse came to pick us all up. We did not need to go via immigration this time as all the diving will be within Thailand. We were driven straight to the pier and by 5:30 were back on the boat. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This live-aboard is shorter than the last one - just three days and three nights. We had the same boat briefing that we had been given last week and returned to the same cabin. The boat was totally full on the last trip but there are a few spaces on this one. We started with eleven guests but picked up two more from an island a few hours away bringing the total up to thirteen. One of them is only snorkeling meaning just twelve divers. There were sixteen plus Camille on the last trip and the boat does feel a lot emptier. The majority of them are not French speakers this time which is also an improvement!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had the traditional fire crackers and staff introductions before eating. Dinner was quite late but we were still back in the cabin before 10.
            </p>
