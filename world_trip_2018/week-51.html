            We had planned to do three dives again today but ended up squeezing in a short fourth one. We had an early start and were in the water at The Hilma Hooker by 7:10. There were three other divers who arrived just after us but we only saw them once briefly underwater so it did not really matter. The dive was very good as usual. The wreck is just over 70m lying at a depth of 30m. Not the most spectacular wreck in the world but getting there early and having the dive site to yourself makes it a very enjoyable dive. Plenty of tarpon in attendance as usual.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-275.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had wanted to dive Salt Pier again for the second dive but found that it was closed to divers due to ongoing maintenence work. We continued South to Pink Beach, another site noted for it's easy entry and exit in rough conditions. This dive was OK without being too memorable but as we got back to the truck, we were told about a big bait ball of fish in the shallows. We had not known about it so had totally missed it. We did not have any more full tanks so we swapped the tanks that we had just come out with and got straight back in again for a shallow (less than 5m) 30 minute dive. The bait ball was very spectacular with thousands of fish tightly grouped together being watched by bigger predators. It was possible to get right into the middle of the ball and be completely surrounded by the fish. A much more memorable experience than anything we had seen on the main site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few hours back at the apartment before the fourth dive. I walked into Kralendijk as I wanted to buy a replacement for the compass I lost in Malaysia. I could not find the one I wanted but did buy a pair of booties to match the ones that Roz bought yesterday. They are much better suited to the beach diving here than the ones we already owned. I also bought antacid tablets to try and sort out the heartburn that I always seem to suffer from when diving in Bonaire for some reason.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The last dive of the day was a 100 minute dive on Bari Reef again. This was very good with thousands of creole wrasse again. We also had two turtle sightings - one hawksbill that we briefly saw swimming out away from the reef and one three-flippered green turtle swimming along the reef towards the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had washed our gear, and sorted out the cameras, I drove to Captain Don's again for take-away pizzas.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th May</span>
            An excellent day's diving today. We were up early and in the water on Bari Reef before 6:00 again. Still no sign of Turtle 1 but we did find the same hawksbill that we have seen here twice already. This time we were able to stay with her for about 40 minutes. We think we may have found her in the area where she sleeps and we were able to swim with her as she started heading South for the day. It was very similar to the early morning experiences we used to have with Turtle 1.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the apartment for breakfast and then drove back South to Salt Pier. This was a very good dive again. The vis was better in the shallows than it was a couple of days ago and Roz counted ten green turtles - seven on the way out and three on the way back. The school of jacks on the pier was a lot bigger than it had been before and we were able to find the frog fish. We knew that one had been spotted here a a day or two ago but we had no idea where it was. I had been looking for it on most of the dive and spotted it as we came back through the Southern section of the pier.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-276.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">For the third dive, we went looking for the bait ball again. We could not see it from Pink Beach so drove North to Tory's Reef. We thought we could see it although it looked a lot smaller than it had done yesterday. We swan out towards it but just as we spotted it, something frightened the fish and they all moved off. We spent another ten minutes or so looking for it but were not able to find it again. We headed out onto the reef and continued the dive anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After about 70 minutes as we were heading back to the mooring buoy, Roz spotted a small eagle ray. It was a brief sighting but she spotted it again a minute or two later. This time we were able to watch it for about 15 minutes. Usually, you can not get close to them as they swim away quickly as soon as they see divers but this one let us get right up to it as it looked for food in the sand. It did not seem put off by us at all and carried on eating as we took photos. It also took us right to the mooring line which was handy as we had not seen it on the way out and were not sure what depth it was at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch back at the apartment and then went back to Bari Reef again for our late afternoon dive. Not quite as spectacular as the other dives today and we did not see any turtles but still a nice enough dive. We ate in the apartment again in the evening and it was another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 8th May</span>
            Just the three dives today. Things got off to a bad start. We had decided to go South again and got almost to the first dive site before realising that we had not loaded the gear into the truck. We had put the tanks in yesterday but had happily driven off without our gear. We returned to Sand Dollar, collected our gear and headed off again delaying our first dive by about 25 minutes.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-277.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were still in the water by just after 7:30. We went in at Angel City, swam out to the outer reef and along the top until we came to the anchor chains of the Hilma Hooker. We came back across to the wreck, had 20 minutes or so on the wreck before going back to the entry point. This is always a good dive and today was no exception. No other divers on the wreck and the bonus of a green turtle on the outer reef.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive, we were back at Salt Pier for an almost identical dive to the one we did here yesterday. This is currently our favourite site here and it can not be dived when there are ships being loaded so we may as well dive it when we can. The dive was just as good as yesterdays with a similar number of turtles and the frog-fish still in the same place. After a few hours back in the apartment, we did our third dive at Buddy's Reef. This was nice enough again with plenty of fish but nothing too remarkable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an earlier finish than usual to our diving as we wanted to go to the presentation by Sea Turtle Conservation Bonaire. This was at 8pm at the Dive Friends Yellow Submarine location. We walked there after eating. The presentations are held every two weeks but we have always managed to miss them previously. It was all reasonably interesting and it was good to be able to talk to the staff about some of our turtle sightings. We have been in touch with them before by e-mail and they have used our photos on their Facebook page so it was nice to actually meet some of them. The presentation lasted about an hour and after ten minutes or so of chatting, we walked back to the apartment.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 9th May</span>
            We did our early morning dive on Bari Reef again today so were up at 5:15 and in the water 30 minutes later. We found the hawksbill after 20 minutes or so in the usual area. We were able to spend a few minutes with her but unfortunately, after going up for air, she went down to 35m. We went down for a few more minutes with her before having to head back shallower. This was the deepest we have ever been in Bonaire and Despite diving Bari Reef over 90 times, I was not really aware that it went as deep as 35m. We continued Southwards and did see her again later in the dive as she came up shallower before disappearing into the distance.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had breakfast on the balcony and then headed North to 1000 steps, managing not to forget anything this time. We dived the Southern section of the site first, had our surface interval on the beach while watching the cruise ship passengers and then went back in to do the Northern part. Both dives were very good although there still do not seem to be any turtles around here anymore. On the first dive we saw a Southern sting-ray and saw another (or the same one?) on the second. On the second dive we had another close encounter with an eagle ray. This one was swimming along the top of the reef but again, allowed us to get quite close and stay with it before it eventually changed direction and swam off. Strange behaviour again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Apart from a walk to the Chinese supermarket, the rest of the afternoon was spent at Sand Dollar editing photos (me), lying in the sun (Roz) and watching the Europa League football on the tablet. Just after 7pm, we went back into Bari Reef for a night dive. I am never that bothered about doing night dives here but Roz was keen. The dive was OK without being quite up to the standard of our last night dive. We were unable to find where the turtle sleeps but did see a couple of huge lobsters walking about and had tarpon swimming around us for most of the dive. The highlight of night dives here used to be getting the tarpon to hunt using the light from your torch although this is now not really encouraged. The tarpon do not seem to have got that message yet! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Cheese on toast on the balcony when we got back and another early night.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 10th May</span>
            It was down South again this morning. We started at Angel City but this time, instead of going North towards the wreck, went to the outside of the second reef and headed South. This had been recommended to us by one of the turtle conservation people and it was a nice dive. We came back along the top of the second reef which was shallower here than at other sites meaning that we could have a longer dive.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We continued driving South from here to Vista Blue. This is another site with easy entry/exit and is also in an area where there is apparently a chance of seeing loggerhead turtles at this time of year. We did not see any loggerheads but did have another 20 minutes or so with another hawksbill. This turtle was also deep but came up to about 10m after a few minutes meaning that we could stay with her. Rest of dive uneventful. Third dive was back at Salt Pier and was the same as usual apart from the fact that the frog-fish had gone. We spent a while looking for it with no luck. The jacks were very good again and we had another half an hour in the shallows with the turtles. We were underwater for nearly two hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an hour or so surface interval back at the apartment and did our usual evening dive on Bari Reef just after 5pm. Enjoyable dive as always but once again, no turtles. We cooked pasta again for tea and it was another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 11th May</span>
            A change to our usual schedule today as it was Sunderland v Portsmouth in the first leg of the play-off semi-final at 2:30 local time. We still managed to get three dives in but stayed local and just did three of the house reefs. We started with an early dive on Bari Reef. This is an excellent time to dive here and although we did not manage to find the turtle this morning it was a very enjoyable 102 minute dive.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-280.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After breakfast we drove to Something Special which is only a few minutes away. We were unable to find the frog-fish this time (they all seem to have left) but again, it is a really nice reef so another enjoyable dive of just over 100 minutes. We had a short stop back at Sand Dollar before going the other direction to The Cliff for the third dive. This was a similar dive to the previous two - all nice enough without seeing anything too remarkable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove back to Sand Dollar, washed our gear and were back in the apartment by 1:30, an hour before kick-off. We had lunch on the balcony while watching the game. We were able to get a pretty good stream of the game so were able to watch the whole match just about uninterrupted.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We also started on the beer during the first half - our first alcohol since arriving in Bonaire. We continued drinking after the game had finished before walking to Captain Don's at 8ish. We had a couple of cocktails with our pizzas and continued drinking until about 12:30 back in the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th May</span>
            A day off diving today. We are here for 20 days and have paid for 18 days of diving so we get to have two days off during our stay. After the amount of time we have spent underwater in the last nine days and the amount of alcohol we had consumed last night, we were in need of a day of not doing a lot.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-281.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have breakfast until after midday and I then went back to sleep until about 2pm. I was not too badly hungover considering the amount we drank yesterday but was in need of catching up on sleep after a lot of early starts.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not have a lot that we needed to do today but did go out in the car at 3ish. We discovered as we were about to go out that we had somehow managed to change the combination of the safe last night and so now can not get anything out of it. No-one in the office was around to sort this out as it is a Sunday so we will have to wait until tomorrow to get access to our money. We did have a credit card and $4 that were not in the safe so not the end of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove into Kralendijk and spent the $4 on ice-creams and then drove down to the area near Salt Pier to take photos of the mountains of salt and the salt flats. We returned via Warehouse to get food for the next week but did not do a lot else for the rest of the day. We had leftover pizza for tea and spent the evening editing photos from the last week.
