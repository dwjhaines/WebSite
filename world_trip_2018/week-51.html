            We had planned to do three dives again today but ended up squeezing in a short fourth one. We had an early start and were in the water at The Hilma Hooker by 7:10. There were three other divers who arrived just after us but we only saw them once briefly underwater so it did not really matter. The dive was very good as usual. The wreck is just over 70m lying at a depth of 30m. Not the most spectacular wreck in the world but getting there early and having the dive site to yourself makes it a very enjoyable dive. Plenty of tarpon in attendance as usual.

            <p class="diary-text">We had wanted to dive Salt Pier again for the second dive but found that it was closed to divers due to ongoing maintenence work. We continued South to Pink Beach, another site noted for it's easy entry and exit in rough conditions. This dive was OK without being too memorable but as we got back to the truck, we were told about a big bait ball of fish in the shallows. We had not known about it so had totally missed it. We did not have any more full tanks so we swapped the tanks that we had just come out with and got straight back in again for a shallow (less than 5m) 30 minute dive. The bait ball was very spectacular with thousands of fish tightly grouped together being watched by bigger predators. It was possible to get right into the middle of the ball and be completely surrounded by the fish. A much more memorable experience than anything we had seen on the main site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few hours back at the apartment before the fourth dive. I walked into Kralendijk as I wanted to buy a replacement for the compass I lost in Malaysia. I could not find the one I wanted but did buy a pair of booties to match the ones that Roz bought yesterday. They are much better suited to the beach diving here than the ones we already owned. I also bought antacid tablets to try and sort out the heartburn that I always seem to suffer from when diving in Bonaire for some reason.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The last dive of the day was a 100 minute dive on Bari Reef again. This was very good with thousands of creole wrasse again. We also had two turtle sightings - one hawksbill that we briefly saw swimming out away from the reef and one three-flippered green turtle swimming along the reef towards the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had washed our gear, and sorted out the cameras, I drove to Captain Don's again for take-away pizzas.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 7th May</span>
            An excellent day's diving today. We were up early and in the water on Bari Reef before 6:00 again. Still no sign of Turtle 1 but we did find the same hawksbill that we have seen here twice already. This time we were able to stay with her for about 40 minutes. We think we may have found her in the area where she sleeps and we were able to swim with her as she started heading South for the day. It was very similar to the early morning experiences we used to have with Turtle 1.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the apartment for breakfast and then drove back South to Salt Pier. This was a very good dive again. The vis was better in the shallows than it was a couple of days ago and Roz counted ten green turtles - seven on the way out and three on the way back. The school of jacks on the pier was a lot bigger than it had been before and we were able to find the frog fish. We knew that one had been spotted here a a day or two ago but we had no idea where it was. I had been looking for it on most of the dive and spotted it as we came back through the Southern section of the pier.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-276.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">For the third dive, we went looking for the bait ball again. We could not see it from Pink Beach so drove North to Tory's Reef. We thought we could see it although it looked a lot smaller than it had done yesterday. We swan out towards it but just as we spotted it, something frightened the fish and they all moved off. We spent another ten minutes or so looking for it but were not able to find it again. We headed out onto the reef and continued the dive anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After about 70 minutes as we were heading back to the mooring buoy, Roz spotted a small eagle ray. It was a brief sighting but she spotted it again a minute or two later. This time we were able to watch it for about 15 minutes. Usually, you can not get close to them as they swim away quickly as soon as they see divers but this one let us get right up to it as it looked for food in the sand. It did not seem put off by us at all and carried on eating as we took photos. It also took us right to the mooring line which was handy as we had not seen it on the way out and were not sure what depth it was at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch back at the apartment and then went back to Bari Reef again for our late afternoon dive. Not quite as spectacular as the other dives today and we did not see any turtles but still a nice enough dive. We ate in the apartment again in the evening and it was another early night.
            </p>
