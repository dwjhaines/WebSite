            We had another change of hotels this morning. We checked out of the B&B Hotel just after 10:00 and had a drive of 30 minutes or so to The Regentpark Hotel near the airport. Here they do a "Sleep, Park & Fly" deal similar to the one we had in Amsterdam. We will stay with them tonight and then leave the car with them while we are in Portugal.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We checked into the hotel when we arrived but could not have the room until 15:00 so went out on our bikes again. The hotel is a mile or so from the Isar radweg so we cycled out there and headed North along it. The cycling was harder work today as it was a lot hotter than last week and most of the path was unsurfaced. However, it was flat most of the way and this path did stick closer to the river than the Danube one had done so was a bit more scenic. I kept going until Moosberg, Roz turned round a few miles before then and went into Friesling instead. We were both worn out and dehydrated by the time we got back to the hotel having done 45 and 32 miles respectively inevitably with no-where near enough water for the higher temperatures.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had showered and recovered, we sorted out what we needed to take to Portugal, put everything else back in the car and then had to drive it to the hotel's car park a mile or so away. We were taken back to the hotel by shuttle bus and went straight out to eat at the hotel restaurant. Had a final schnitzel and wheat beer and were back in the room just after 8:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th June</span>
            We were up at 5:50, had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and were taken on the 6:30 hotel shuttle bus to Munich airport. By the time we had got to the airport, gone through security and got to the gates, we had about an hour to wait for the 8:20 Lufthansa flight to Porto. The flight left a few minutes late and we landed in Porto slightly late at about 11:45 local time. It did not take long to get through the airport as we only had hand luggage and we were traveling between two countries in the Schengen area so no immigration/passport checks.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We  had a wait of about 15 minutes for the metro in to the centre and about 40 minutes later we arrived at Bolhão metro station. The apartment we had booked was about 30 seconds walk from the station. We easily found the entrance and were let in by Steve who had arrived yesterday evening and stayed here last night.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-301.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We sat around in the apartment (which is very nice and an ideal base for the next six days)  for a couple of hours and went out at about 2pm. We were quite keen to visit the port area before it filled up with football fans and headed for the Taylors Port Lodge. Taylors was recommended in Lonely Planet for the views looking back over Porto. The walk to the lodge was spectacular, walking through the old town and over the higher level of the Luís I bridge with good views all along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            When we got to Taylors, we decided not to bother with the tour and went straight to the tasting room. It was a bit more upmarket than some of the lodges apart from the fact that Adrian Durham and Darren Gough were broadcasting live for Talk Sport from the corner of the room for some reason. We had a couple of glasses of port in there before walking down to the other lodges by the riverside.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent an hour or so outside one of the restaurants sampling a few more glasses of port which was all very pleasant before walking back across the lower level of the bridge. We wandered through the area where most of the England fans (and the local riot police) seemed to be gathering and started walking back up the hill in the general direction of the apartment. We stopped at a burger restaurant for tea and then walked up to Armazém da Cerveja, a craft beer bar just round the corner from where we are staying. I had read about this place on the internet and it was another superb bar with a huge range of bottled beers and a decent selection of cheap local draft beer. We spent a few hours in here and were joined by Sheila who we had met in Moscow. We walked from there back to the apartment sometime around 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th June</span>
            Yesterday we had been undecided about whether to go to the Portugal v Switzerland game tonight but when we woke up, there were "restricted view" tickets available for €25 each so we bought two. Steve had already got his.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-302.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            Steve went out to buy stuff for breakfast which we were eating when Sheila turned up with Rich who we had also met in Russia, Sharon and a few others. Steve went out sight-seeing with them but sight seeing in a large group did not really appeal so we made our excuses and stayed in the apartment. We went out on our own an hour or so later and continued to do bits of the Lonely Planet walking tour. We walked down to the São Bento railway station which has some of the best examples of the blue and white azulejo tiles that this area is famous for. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from there to the Igreja dos Clérigos church and tower that has excellent views of the town. We were told that there was a 30 minute queue to get up the tower so we did not bother. We had a look round the church instead and then walked round the big square that hosts the fan park. This was about all we wanted to do and were going to walk back to the apartment and then go and meet the others when we found the Nortada microbrewery. This was another good bar and we went in for our first beer of the day. We got in touch with Steve who had managed to find a bar that had sold out of beer and wine. We sat there for a while and then took everyone back to the microbrewery where four of us had lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The others all headed back to their hotel from the microbrewery. We walked back to the apartment and went out again about 15 minutes later.We walked towards the bar we had been in last night but stopped at another craft beer bar that was on the way. This had another very good range of beers and a nice beer garden that was just about warm enough to sit in. We had a couple in there before walking to the ground that was a couple of miles away. We stopped for a couple more drinks on the way and got to the ground at about 7pm, 45 minutes before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We all managed to get in without any problems despite being slightly concerned about the new paperless, bluetooth ticketing system. It all worked better than expected and we were in the ground with plenty of time to spare. We swapped seats with a couple of English blokes, one of whom was on crutches and did not want to have to walk up steps so ended up with very good seats with an excellent view. Although we do not usually bother with games that do not involve England, this was all quite entertaining and we both enjoyed it. Good value for our €25!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the game, Roz and I walked back towards the apartment when we got a message from Steve saying that he had met up with Jer and his mates in another good beer bar on the way (Porto does seem very good for beer!). We stayed in there until it closed at midnight before continuing our walk back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th June - Netherlands v England</span>
            We were up by 9:00 feeling slightly rough from last night. Roz and I went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the room before walking down to the main square at Aliados where we were due to catch the bus to Guimarães. Steve had booked us all onto one of the six buses taking England fans to and from the venue of tonight's game. We were at the pick-up point by 10:35 and met up with Sheila, etc. Our bus departed just after 11:00 for the one hour journey
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were dropped in the coach drop off/pick up point which was just outside the old town and about a mile from the ground. The three of us walked into the old town and had a look round some of the buildings there. The weather forecast for today had not been great and it was cold and grey as we walked around. After half an hour or so, it started to rain. We realised that we need to find somewhere to sit as soon as possible as Guimarães was unlikely to have enough cafes or bars for the amount of people arriving. Most people would have been expecting to drink outside but with the rain getting heavier places were starting to fill up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found a cafe on the edge of the old town which did not seem ideal initially but did not work out too badly. We got the last table in there and spent four hours in there while watching the constant heavy rain. It did mean having to drink Super Bock for four hours but it was full of England fans and the atmosphere was good. We would have liked to move around gone to a few different places but the rain was torrential at times and there was no way we were going to give up our chairs.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-303.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">At about 5:00, with the rain finally easing, Steve went and found a table in a restaurant just down the road. We ate in there with a few more drinks before walking the half a mile or so to the ground. Slightly longer queues than last night but we were still in the ground and in our seats by 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was OK but ultimately, ended in disappointment again. The fact that we had come so close to winning it and then had given it away with stupid mistakes made the result particularly hard to take. It also means having to come back to Guimarães on Sunday for the third place play-off instead of being able to remain in Porto for the final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We made our way back to the buses as soon as the final whistle went. There was some confusion at the pick-up point but we were just about back on the bus by the time the rain started getting heavy again. We were dropped back in Porto just after midnight, walked back to the apartment and went straight to bed.
