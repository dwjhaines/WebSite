            We left the apartment at 9ish and drove down to the lake for breakfast. We left there by about 10 and started driving towards our next destination, Bitola. We are stopping there as it is on our way to Greece, about 10 miles from the border. We decided to take the scenic route and drive through the National Park Galičica which meant driving over the Galičica Mountain which dominates one side of the lake. The mountain is between Macedonia's two biggest lakes, Ohrid and Lake Prespa. The 27km road goes through the Galičica Pass which is almost 1000m above the lakes. The drive up on the Ohrid side was particularly spectacular with hairpin bends and plenty of scenic viewpoints. We had several stops to add to the collection of Ohrid photos we have built up over the last week or so. The drive down on the other side was a more gentle incline without the views as the road was bordered by trees.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When we reached the road round Lake Prespa, it was only 45km to Bitola. We found our hotel on the road into town and checked in for the night. We went out to look around the town at 2ish, just as it started to rain. We sheltered for about 10 minutes during the heaviest part before continuing our walk. The main sights here are a couple of mosques and the old shopping bazaar, none of which were particularly impressive. We bought a few things from a supermarket and returned to the hotel to eat lunch. It rained for most of the rest of the afternoon so we stayed in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The rain had stopped by the time we went out in the evening. We walked through the newer part of Bitola which was a lot nicer than the part we had seen at lunchtime. We headed to "Pub Bourbon Street", another craft beer pub. This was very good. Although it was done up like an Irish pub inside, it had a good semi outdoor seating area and did 660ml bottles of its own beer for £2. We had several of their wheat beers and also had our final meal of kebabs and salad in there. We left when it closed at about 12:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 24th July</span>
            We left the hotel at about 10:00, stocked up on Macedonian wine, filled up with petrol and headed for the Greek border. The border was straight-forward again and by about midday, we had crossed over into Greece.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-064.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first place we were stopping was Nymfaio, a small village in the mountains about an hours drive from the border. We were hearing the reports of the fires in Southern Greece caused by the heat this morning but as we arrived at Nymfaio it was grey, wet and about 17°c. It took us a while to get into our hotel as it seemed completely locked up and deserted but eventually someone turned up and we checked into a very nice room with excellent views of the surrounding area.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The reason for visiting Nymfaio is the Arcturos Bear Sanctuary. Brown bears are native to this area of Greece and the sanctuary takes in bears that have been held in captivity and are unable to be released back into the wild. They used to take in a lot of the former "dancing bears" although this practice died out in Greece during the 1990's. A lot of them now come from zoos and circuses.The bears stay there for the rest of their lives in conditions as close as possible to their natural habitat. We went on the 25 minute tour where we were told about the sanctuary and were able to walk past some of the enclosures where the bears live. We were able to see about half of the 14 bears that they currently have at there. It was all very well done and we were pleasantly surprised at the number of bears we were able to see. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to the hotel via the village. The sun had come out by this time and it was all looking a bit more inviting than when we had arrived but still not too warm. We did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We ate at the restaurant at the hotel as we could not be bothered to walk back down to the village. For the first time since leaving home in May, I had to wear shoes, socks and jeans in the evening due to the cold!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 25th July</span>
            After breakfast, we packed the car, left the key at reception and walked down to the centre of the village. The old school here is now used as an information centre for Arcturos, the people who run the bear sanctuary. The price of our ticket yesterday included a one hour guided tour of the centre with more details about the bears and what Arcturos are doing, not only for the bears but other animals and the environment in general. We were the only ones on our tour and it was all quite interesting and informative and we were glad that we had made the effort to visit the centre.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-065.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Our next destination was Kastoria about 50 miles away. We are in another hotel with excellent views but again, it is up a very steep hill, this time probably too long and steep for cycling. Although slightly warmer than yesterday when we arrived at the hotel, the weather was similarly grey and wet. It was warm and very nice in between the showers but it was wet for most of the day. This was a shame as we have one of the nicest balconies we have had on the trip so far and we had chosen the hotels for the views.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We managed to eat lunch on the balcony without getting too wet. Roz did go to the pool for an hour so to swim but it was not sun-bathing weather so I stayed in the room. We went for a walk around the village at 5ish - perfectly timed to ensure we were at the furthest point from the hotel when the heaviest shower of the afternoon started! We did, however, establish that there is a taverna in the village and it is open this evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">As we are here for two nights and the weather forecast for tomorrow was similar to today's, we decided we may as well have a few drinks this evening. We had one of the bottles we had bought from Macedonia on our balcony before walking back down to the taverna. We had an excellent meal here including the local wild mushrooms and a few jugs of the local white wine before returning to the hotel. Got to bed sometime after midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 26th July</span>
            Had an excellent breakfast in the hotel restaurant followed by about ten minutes of playing with the five kittens that live here. Did not do a lot else for the rest of the morning. The weather was better than expected so at about midday we went to have a look round Kastoria. Neither of us fancied cycling up the hill that our hotel is on so we drove down to the bottom, parked the car and continued on our bikes from there.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-066.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Kastoria is built on a peninsular that juts into Lake Orestiada. We did not see much of the town itself but cycled round the peninsular. It was a quiet, flat road with little traffic so ideal for cycling. We were by the lake all the way round and there were a few small churches to look at on the way as well as pelicans and white ducks. We went briefly into the town to find a cash-point and a supermarket (for lunch and cat treats) before cycling back round in the other direction. Although the weather was good for most of our ride, we got totally soaked again in a heavy shower as we rode the last two miles back to the car. It was sunny again by the time we were back at the hotel so we were able to have lunch on our balcony.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, we had to decide on our plans for tomorrow. We have places booked for Saturday onwards but were unsure about where we were going to stay tomorrow. The weather forecast for where we were thinking of going to was a lot worse than it is for here so after a bit of dithering we decided just to stay here for a third night instead. Our evening was pretty much the same as last night i.e. wine on the balcony and then a trip to the taverna in the village before returning to the balcony for another bottle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 27th July</span>
            A similar day to yesterday. We went for our bike ride a bit earlier today to try and avoid the rain which seems to start regularly in mid afternoon. We drove down the hill again and cycled just about the same route as yesterday but did lock up bikes and go for a walk around part of the old town which was not too exciting. We did have some rain towards the end of our ride but no-where near as heavy as yesterday.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-067.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Both journeys up and down the hill today needed stops to help tortoises cross the road. There are a lot of wild tortoises wandering about here and if they get frightened by approaching cars when crossing the road, they just stop and go into their shells which is probably not the most sensible thing to do. Roz moved one to the side of the road on the way down and had to do the same with two that were sat in the road on the way back up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch on the balcony again. It rained intermittently all afternoon. While the UK seems to be having its best summer ever, we are in Greece and having to stay in our room to shelter from the rain! It was just about warm enough to sit in the sun in between showers but hopefully we will see an improvement after we leave here tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a night off the wine tonight so we ate in the hotel restaurant. Slightly more expensive than the taverna but it does have the good views of the lake. Had to eat inside as it was too cold to sit outside. I stayed up until about 11:00 trying to photograph the blood moon. For the first time since we arrived here, the clouds did clear and we were able to see it briefly.
