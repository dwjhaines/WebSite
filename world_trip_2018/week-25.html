            Not too any people around today. Monday is "changeover day" here. The cheapest way of getting to or from Derawan is to get the boat which goes back and fore to Tarakan once a week. Staffan, Peo, Lucas, Florian Steve and Clare left on the boat at 5:30 and most of the new guests did not arrive until the boat returned late afternoon.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">This meant that it was just Aleks, Kate, Roz and me diving today. We dived in one group led by Wan, one of the three Indonesian guides that work here. We did three local dives again at Derawan but it was a much better day's diving than it was last Tuesday. The first two sites were the same, Macro Mania and Tortoruga (previously called Ghost Wreck) with the third being at Snapper Point.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-131.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive started badly. We saw a turtle as soon as we descended to the bottom. I was going to take a photo but noticed some condensation in my camera housing. I considered aborting the dive but it did not look too serious so I continued. After about 30 minutes a light came on on the camera which should not have happened so it was obvious that water was in it. The dive itself was very good with a mixture of interesting macro and a few big sleepy turtles in the shallows.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, I tried to dry out the camera but it is not looking good. I have had the camera a long time and it has done about 800 dives so I have definitely had my moneys worth from it. I had considered upgrading it before the start of this trip but it did everything I wanted and was very easy to use so I had decided to keep it. It is inevitable that underwater cameras flood eventually but still quite upsetting when it happens.  
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was very good again. The dive site was in the same place as the second dive we did here last week but seemed to have changed its name today. There was not so much macro on this dive as the current had picked up but it was low tide so there were a lot of turtles about. Roz counted 18 in total. The third dive was at a site we had not been to before. This was a submerged pinnacle and was a very good dive. Following on from my frog fish spot the other day, I managed to find a tiny baby cuttle fish on this dive. We saw bump-heads twice on the dive and another hawksbill turtle. Very nice coral in the shallows at the end.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort early again. For the first time since we have been there, there was a very high tide in the late afternoon. At high tide the turtles come up into the shallows to feed. We went out with our snorkels and spent about 30 minutes swimming with them. We knew they were there but were not expecting to be able to get so close to them and were not expecting so many. There must have been 12 - 15 of them in the shallow area in front of the balconies and we could see five at the same time at one point. A very nice way to end the day!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Usual restaurant for tea and another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 6th November</span>
            It was back to Maratua today. Only six divers on the boat as a lot of the people staying here have gone on a day trip to snorkel with whale sharks, something we were not really bothered about. We dived in two groups of three. We were joined by Nick from Alaska and were led by Igo.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-132.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive of the day was at Turtle Traffic. Theresa is aware that Roz likes turtles so did this dive at low tide when most of them are off the top of the reef. We had seen 18 here when we dived it last week but Roz counted 44 on this dive. Only once have we we seen more on a single dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive 2 was at lighthouse. This did not really go to plan. We were supposed to drift to the Northern tip of the island and swim round a corner where there is a lot of big fish activity. I don't know whose fault it was but we were dropped so that we had to fight strong current to get towards the corner. Igo is not the most experienced of guides and seemed unable to decide whether to keep swimming into the current or change the plan and just swim the other way (which is what the other group did). In the end we had a couple of half-hearted attempts to get to the corner but spent most of the dive hanging around in the same place apparently hoping the current would change direction. We did see some of the biggest barrel sponges we have ever seen on the dive but certainly not the best dive of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive 3 was at Gorgonzola. This was a slightly more conventional dive. We drifted with the current along a wall. Plenty of fish without seeing anything too spectacular. When the current dropped completely, we swan back to the starting point along the top of the reef which was very nice.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort a bit later tonight. Roz went snorkeling with the turtles again but I could not be bothered. No chicken sate or squid in the restaurant so two plates of particularly unappetizing fried noodles before going back to listen to the karaoke.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 7th November</span>
            Our third trip to Sangalaki today and probably the best days diving.... despite it being another day of not seeing mantas. It was the same people on the boat as yesterday with the addition of another group of three. We were in the same group as yesterday with Nick and had Igo guiding again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at The Wall again. This dive was OK, but again there was little current and no sign of any mantas. By the second dive, we had just about accepted that we would not see mantas and concentrated on the reef. This was an excellent dive. Igo finally found something to show us - a hairy octopus not long after we had gone down to the reef. Only ever seen one of these before and were not expecting to see one here. We also saw two hawksbill turtles
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-133.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After this, the dive went away from the plan again as the current picked up and took us down Manta Run. We drifted over the reef for about 45 minutes seeing a couple of hawksbills along the way. The reef along here was very nice and it was probably the fishiest dive we have done here. Big schools of butterfly fish, red-tooths, fusiliers and snapper made the whole dive very enjoyable. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was almost as good. Once again it was a drift along the reef from Manta Tease. We were joined by a hawksbill for about four or five minutes as we drifted and again, there were plenty of fish along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was raining heavily by the time we were back at the resort so neither of us could be bothered to go snorkeling. It was still a very high tide so we were instead able to sit on the balcony watching the turtles coming up for air just beneath us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once again, there was not a lot available at our usual restaurant so we tried somewhere different. Food was OK again without being anything special. Both getting tired after diving 17 of the last 18 days so another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th November</span>
            It was back to Kakaban for our three dives today. We had exactly the same people on the boat as yesterday with everyone in the same groups.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The dive sites today were the same as when we came here six days ago, Meditation Point, Barracuda Point and Crack In. All three dives were good without being anything too remarkable. Two hawksbills and a white tip on the second dive probably the highlights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not bother going back to the jellyfish lake between the first two dives this time as we were huddled in the front of the boat with Kate and Alex trying to keep warm. The weather today was terrible. We had torrential rain from about 4am and I woke to find water dripping onto my laptop. Fortunately, it was not too much water. I don't think I would have been able to cope with losing the laptop and my camera in the same week! The rain had eased off by the time we left the jetty but returned again halfway through the journey to Kakuban. It rained constantly through the rest of the day until about the end of the last dive meaning that we never really warmed up between dives. Despite the weather, it was still a good days diving.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">We both went out snorkeling when we got back and again, there were about 10 - 15 large turtles swimming around in the sea grass in the shallows by the bungalows. After much needed hot showers, it was a return to the usual restaurant and a karaoke free evening for a change. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 9th November</span>
            We had our third trip to Maratua today. There were the same number of people on the boat with a couple of changes. We lost Nick from our group - he moved to the other boat - and gained Laura. Led by Igo again. Much better weather than yesterday.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">It was another bad start to the day. Since my camera died, we had been taking it in turns to use Roz's. On the way to Maratua, there were dolphins swimming beside the boat. Roz tried to take photos but when she tried to turn the camera on, it just said "lens error" and shut itself down. This is an issue that Canon cameras have had for years and is not something that is going to get fixed in Derawan. I have seen it on a camera 12 years ago and the camera never recovered. We may be able to get this fixed eventually but we have now lost both of our underwater cameras in the space of three days. We still have a GoPro which is OK for video but does not take great photos underwater.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was not a lot we could do about this so had to get on with the days diving and try not to think about it. As it turned out, we had one of the best days diving we have ever had. The first dive was at Fusilier Paradise again. Quite strong currents on this dive including both up and down currents at various times. We knew there was a low tide which meant a good chance of seeing turtles but were not expecting anywhere near as many as we did see. Roz counted a total of 41 including more hawksbills than we have ever seen on a single dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-135.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">However, this figure was well beaten by the second dive at Turtle Traffic. We were in the water just after low tide and there were turtles everywhere. We counted more than 50 in the first thirty minutes of the dive which already meant that we had seen more than on any dive before. In the end, I had counted 87, Roz's total was 91 and Igo reckoned he had seen 105. We also saw turtles mating underwater for the first time ever. Turtley Terrific!!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive Gusung Pal was a bit of an anti-climax after the first two but we still saw one green turtle and had a good five minutes with a hawksbill so another good dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at Derawan we went snorkeling again. Not as many turtles tonight but I did see a guitar shark, which was another first. Did not do a lot for the rest of the evening apart from using our limited internet access to try and work out how to get our cameras fixed or replaced. Ate in the usual restaurant and another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 10th November</span>
            Our last day of diving from Derawan and a final trip to Sangalaki. Boat and groups were the same as yesterday.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had not been that impressed with the diving at Sangalaki on our previous three visits. The diving had been very good but probably not quite up to the expectations that we had when we got here. Today was unbelievable!!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had seen mantas at the surface before the first dive so knew they were around. First dive was at The Wall as usual. We got in and swam straight to the biggest cleaning station where we saw our first manta. This cleaning station is quite large and we were all at the bottom of it so although we had a good view of the manta, it was quite a way away. After five minutes or so here, we moved to another cleaning station, Manta Tease. We saw another manta here which we were much closer to it. As we were all moving away, another appeared and stayed on the cleaning station for about 15 minutes. We had perfect views of this one and another couple that came and tried to move in unsuccessfully. This was more the sort of dive we were expecting in Sangalaki.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-136.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was also very good. We saw a manta and a hawksbill turtle as we were descending. We had a few minutes with the hawksbill before continuing to more cleaning stations. We saw a few more manta and also a baby white tip reef shark under some table coral. Towards the end of the dive, there were suddenly mantas all over the place. I lost count but Igo reckoned that we saw about 15 in total on the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was during lunch after the second dive that there suddenly seemed to be mantas everywhere. We had just been given our lunch when manta were spotted again. Most of us on the boat jumped in with snorkels and drifted along Manta Run. In the space of about 15 minutes, we went the length of the dive site and had about 35 - 40 mantas swimming past us in the opposite direction. You are supposed to remain at least 3m from mantas but this was impossible as they came close enough to us to be able to touch them. When we got to the end of the dive site, the boat picked us up, returned us to our starting point and we repeated the drift. Again, there was a constant flow of mantas swimming towards and past us. Roz counted 32 this time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were hoping that there would still be some around when we went in for the third dive. This time we drifted along Manta Run about 6m below the surface and still the mantas continued to come. We occasionally hooked onto the reef to stop and watch them but we did not really need to do this as there were mantas wherever we went. By the time we got to the end of the dive, Roz had counted 70 mantas (and one hawksbill turtle) an incredible number for a single dive. We spoke to Jordon, one of the managers here when we got back to Derawan and he told us that today was exceptional. Since Scuba Junkie opened in Derawan two years ago, they have never had a day when there have been so many mantas. They have had dives where they have seen up to 50 but never as many as today. Not a bad way to finish our diving here!
            </p>
                       
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of beers with with everyone before going out to eat. There were a lot of manta photos and videos to look at! We ate at our usual restaurant with a couple more beers and then returned to our balcony to finish our orange vodka while following the football. Just about managed to stay awake until full time just before 1am.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 11th November</span>
            For the first time in a while, a day of not doing much. We could have dived this morning but we have dived 20 of the last 21 days so decided we needed a day off before flying tomorrow. We were up for breakfast at 8:00 and then spent almost an hour snorkeling with the turtles for a final time. Once again, there were at least 10 of them in the shallows so an enjoyable start to the day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Quite a few people were leaving today. Alex and Kate left at 11:00 together with the group of three from France. Two others, also from France, left later in the day. It was very hot today. This was good news for getting our gear dry but meant that doing anything was quite an effort. Spent a lot of the day sorting out photos and gradually packing our gear as it dried but did not do a lot else. We did go out for a walk in the evening and saw the baby guitar sharks that live just about on the beach at the end of the island.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had our last meal in our usual restaurant but were in bed by about 9:30. Thankfully no karaoke!
