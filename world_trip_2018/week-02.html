			Left the hotel at 10:30 and got the tram with Regan and Annette to Hackerbrucke S-Bahn station where we met Cathy. We got the S-Bahn out to Herrshing and from there, a bus up to the monastery/brewery at Andechs. Gary, Hoggy Dave and Ed had walked up from Herrshing - something they looked as if they regretted by the time they got there. We had 
			been keen to come here but Regan had wanted to go to a beer garden at Tutzing so we had a few at the monastery and then got a bus to Tutzing. Regan's beer garden in Tutzing was closed when we got there but we found somewhere else for a couple of beers before getting the 17:00 train back into Munich.
			</p>
      <p class="diary-text">
			We all went to the Lowenbrau Haus for a couple before going to eat at the Union Brau Haus. We split up again here as not everyone wanted to eat. After eating once again, half of us went to the Schneider Weiss pub before meeting up with the others at the pig pub (apart from Cathy who had got a taxi home at 9ish). Slightly more sober than on previous nights, we made it for a final beer at the Hofbrauhaus before getting the U-Bahn home.</p>
      <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 5th June</span>
			We checked out of the Ibis just before midday and while everyone else was flying home, we had a two hour drive down to Fussen, the last town at the Southern end of the Romantic Road. We had planned to camp for three days here but as the weather has been so bad, we had booked a "holiday house" about 2km out of the town. It was not easy to find the house&nbsp; but once there, it was very nice - better than it had looked in the pictures when we booked it. We emptied the car and could finally dry the camping equipment that had been wet since last Friday.&nbsp; After eating lunch, We cycled into Fussen to have a look round the town and get information about what we want to do for the next couple of days.</p>
			
      <p class="diary-text">
			Fussen was another really nice place to visit - all the usual buildings to walk round but with the Alps in the background making it more spectacular than some of the other places on our route. We visited tourist information for details of how to get to the two castles that we will visit tomorrow and also got cycle route information. Spent the rest of the afternoon wandering round the town before heading back to the house. We were both pretty knackered after the last three days' drinking and could not be bothered to go out to eat so we bought pizzas from a supermarket and had an early night.</p>

      <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 6th June</span>
			We were awake fairly early so headed off by about 8 towards the two castles that this area is famous for. We cycled the 3-4 miles to Hohenschwangau and left our bikes near the ticket office. Schloss Hohenschwangau was first on our list and was only about a 30 minute walk up the hill from where we parked our bikes. This was quite a nice building but it is Schloss Neuschwanstein that is the more famous and most spectacular. This was another 30 minute walk away. It looked as we were climbing that most of this was covered by scaffolding but as we approached, it was just one side that was covered and most of it was unaffected. We walked round the part of the castle that was free to enter but did not pay the €12 entrance fees to do the guided tour. (we decided not to pay this in either castle). From the castle we continued walking to the Marienbrüke , a high bridge behind the castle which gave the best views of the whole area.

      <p class="diary-text">  We cycled back to the house for lunch and after an hours sleep, we headed off on our bikes again. This time just a short ride round Hopfen-See and the surrounding towns - about 15 miles in total. This was again very scenic but it rained for a lot of the trip which was not ideal.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			Had a couple of beers in the house in the evening before going out to eat. The house has been ideal given that the weather has been so poor. There is plenty of space to get everything dry and a shed to keep our bikes locked&nbsp; up in. It has also saved us money on food and drinks as we can buy both from the local supermarket and consume them in the dining area. Adding to the Alpine atmosphere, and one of the things we will remember most about the place is the constant sound of cow bells from the four cows that live in the field next to the house!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			The weather was still bad when we did go out so we walked to the nearest restaurant. This happened to be an Italian so we had pizza for the second night in a row. </p>
			

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img bsrc="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LWiVc_gbOaM/T9N26xfLeyI/AAAAAAAAELw/sgqR38LF3Oc/s320/IMG_0922.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday, 7th June</span>
			For the first time in the last week we woke up to good weather. Still plenty of cloud around but the sun was shining and it had stopped raining. We spent the morning cycling round Forggensee - the biggest lake in the area - a round trip of about 25 miles. The weather got even better in the afternoon so we were able to spend a few hours sitting in the sun on the terrace of the house. At 5ish, we returned to Hopfen am See one of the places we cycled through yesterday in the rain. It did look a lot better in the sun! We had a beer in the Paulaner Beer Garden - one of the most scenic locations for a beer garden we have ever seen - before cycling back to the house again. 
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It was still warm enough to sit outside when we got back so we had a couple of drinks on our terrace before cycling into the centre of Fussen to eat. We both had schnitzels in a Bavarian restaurant. It started raining again as we cycled home so we called into a bar for another drink. By the time it came to leaving here, the rain was a lot worse and we got totally soaked cycling home the last mile in the dark.</p>
			

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HgZRUCYVhBY/T9N3ALBFn9I/AAAAAAAAEMA/5jRYHYfWP1s/s320/IMG_0933.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 8th June</span>We were both slightly hung-over when we got up but we managed to get everything packed into the car again and were on our way back to Munich by about 10:00. We had decided to call in at a couple more towns en-route. The first being Oberammergau. This was another really picturesque little town famous for the paintings on the facades of the buildings. We spent an hour or so wandering around before driving to Bad T<font face="Times New Roman">ö</font>lz, another very nice town, although by this time, I think we had seen enough picturesque German towns. It was not as spectacular as some of the other places we have been in the last week and after walking up and down the main drag, we walked back to the car and continued on to Munich.
			
<p class="diary-text">
			It was only a 40 minute drive from Bad Tölz 
			to Munich and again we found the hotel very easily. We had booked a 
			Mercure Hotel some way out of town as it has free car parking (in 
			the street outside the hotel) and we will 
			leave the car here for two weeks while we are at Euro 2012 in 
			Ukraine. We had checked in by about 3:30 and after checking e-mail 
			and sorting out our luggage for the trip to Ukraine, we headed out 
			to try and find somewhere to watch the first game of the tournament 
			- Poland v Greece.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">
			There was nothing at all in the area around the hotel but we had 
			been recommended a restaurant about 30 minutes walk away. We could 
			not find the restaurant when we got there but found a Turkish bar 
			with a tele where we watched the first half. We found the restaurant 
			at half time but there was no tele there so we returned to the same 
			bar for the second half. We did then return to the restaurant which 
			turned out to be one of the best places we have eaten at in Munich. 
			- huge portions of Bavarian food in a really nice traditional 
			restaurant. We missed the first half of the Russia v Czech Republic 
			game but walked back to the hotel (getting soaked again on the way) 
			and watched the second half in the bar.</p>
			
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday 9th June</span>We left all the 
			stuff that we do not need for Ukraine in the car and checked out of 
			the hotel by about 11:30. We got a bus and the U-bahn to Munich Hbf 
			where we had just under two hours to kill&nbsp; before getting on 
			the 13:27 train to Vienna. We have flights booked to Donetsk from 
			Vienna and although we had originally planned to drive to Vienna, 
			the train was a cheaper and easier option. The train left on time 
			and arrived punctually in Vienna at 17:44. It was a pretty good 
			journey on a modern fast train with very few other passengers.
			</p>
<p class="diary-text">
			We walked from the station to an Ibis just across the road and 
			checked in just in time to watch the Holland v Denmark game in the 
			room. As soon as this game had finished we had about a one mile walk 
			to "7 Stern Brau" a brewery that we have visited a few times before 
			when we have been in Vienna. We were keen to go there but were also 
			keen to watch the Germany v Portugal game. Fortunately, they had 
			installed a tv in there since we were last there so we were able to 
			stay in there for the evening while watching football. Walked back 
			to the hotel as soon as the game finished.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YyIfg0eHWos/T9hFdCW8FSI/AAAAAAAAEdE/9LsQ7RaoduY/s320/IMG_0945.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday 10th June</span>We were up by 
			6ish, checked out and walked back to the Westbahnhof as this is the 
			departure point for the airport bus. We got the 7:00 bus and left 
			Vienna in another torrential rain shower. We were at the airport by 
			7:45 and after a few problems at check-in (there was a problem with 
			our ticket numbers apparently) we made our way to the Austrian 
			Airways lounge to wait for our flights to Donetsk. The only seats we 
			had been able to book for this flight were in business class - the 
			main reason we had not flown from Munich. Had a couple of hours wait 
			in the lounge before we departed on time at 10:35.</p>
			

<p class="diary-text">
Arrived in Donetsk at 2:00 and got straight through immigration 
			without any major problems. Had the usual arguments with the taxi 
			drivers about prices but eventually got a cab for UAH50 (£1 = 
			UAH12.5). Twenty minutes later, we were at the hostel where we met 
			Mark and Steve in reception together with about ten giggling 
			Ukrainian teenage girls who were working on reception. After filling 
			in our forms we were shown to our room which was every bit as basic 
			as expected! The hostel is a university hall of residence - "Donetsk 
			National University of Economics &amp; Trade, Hostel No. 1" to be 
			precise. It looks as if not much has been done to it in the last 70 
			years but is clean enough and will be fine for a few days.</p>
			
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-G9QRbVJIqB8/T9hFjWmHr4I/AAAAAAAAEdI/z7QkjaG2dFc/s320/IMG_0947.JPG"></div>
<p class="diary-text">
			We 
			left our luggage in the room and the four of us got a bus into the 
			centre of Donetsk. The main problem with Donetsk is that it is a 
			long way from anywhere and there is not a lot to do (and there are 
			not many hotel rooms!). However, on first impressions, it seemed a 
			lot better than we had expected although the weather was excellent 
			which helped. Despite the lack of sights it was a a pleasant enough 
			to wander around. The number one sight to see here according to 
			Lonely Planet is the Donbass Arena where England play their first 
			game tomorrow. This says a lot about the lack of anything else to 
			see!</p>
			
<p class="diary-text">We went for a couple of drinks in the John Hughes Brewery (named 
			after the founder of the city) and then to the Golden Lion to watch 
			the first of today's two games. This is the pub where most of our 
			fans will gather tomorrow and the upstairs part was set aside for 
			englandfans members together with guests Chris Kamara, Steve 
			Clarridge and Graham Taylor. It was OK up here but for some reason, 
			they were making everyone drink from plastic glasses so we went back 
			downstairs to watch the game.&nbsp; After the first game, we moved 
			to another bar for the Croatia v Ireland match before getting a taxi 
			back to the hotel by about midnight.</p>
