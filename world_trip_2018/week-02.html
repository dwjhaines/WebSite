                A very similar day to yesterday. After breakfast at the campsite, we went off on our bikes again. We followed the Altmühltal Radweg again but in the opposite direction this time. Roz did not want to cycle as far today so turned round at Kottingwörth but still did a round trip of 30 miles. I was quite keen on trying to get to Kelhiem at the end of the cycle route. This would have been a round trip of 80 miles. However, I gave up on this idea at Riedenburg. The cycling was relatively easy on flat paths and I should have been able to get there and back, but the 28° - 30° heat was taking its toll. Although the legs were fine, I decided the extra 20 miles was not a good idea particularly as a lot of the paths were unsurfaced making it harder work than normal... and, as usual, I had not taken any where near enough water with me I turned round after 30 miles and just about made it back to Kipfenberg. Rest of the afternoon was spent recovering in the shade. (While in Riedenburg, I found out that our World Cup tickets are finally on their way and should be delivered tomorrow which is good news)

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a beer by the tent before going out in the evening. We had planned to go back to the pizza place we had eaten at a couple of nights ago but it was closed on a Monday. We walked past it anyway to check it was closed and then found a small bar on our way into town that served the cheapest wheat beer we had seen for a long time in Germany. We stopped there for one and then walked round the town to find that just about everything else was also closed on a Monday. We returned to the bar which although a bit basic was a friendly enough place and had good views of the castle. We gave up on eating, had a few beers in there and returned to the camp site.

                We were up by 8ish had breakfast and packed away the tent. We left the campsite just before 10 and started driving towards Linz. We had planned to spend a couple more nights camping at Au an der Donau but again we were unsure of exactly what we were doing because of the weather forecast. We had a petrol stop and a stop to buy our Austrian vignette (motorway tax) and were at the campsite by about 14:00.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-010.JPG"></div>
            
            <p class="diary-text">When we got there, we were still not really sure what to do. The campsite looked nice enough but the area around it was nothing spectacular and the weather forecast was not great. We decided to drive another hour or so further East to Melk which looked a nicer place and seemed to have a slightly less chance of rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This proved to be a good move. The campsite is a lot more basic than the one we have left and it is a lot smaller but it is right on the banks of the Danube and is less than a km walk into the centre of the old town. We managed to get the tent up in a fraction of the time it took for our first attempt and went straight into the old town for a look around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Melk is totally dominated by the abbey which sits on a hill above the old town. It looks as if it is as big as the rest of the town and can be seen from just about everywhere. We parked our bikes in the centre of the town which itself is fairly compact and spent 30 minutes or so wandering round. All very picturesque! Roz went back to the tent while I cycled to Pöchlarn and back. Pöchlarn is the next town up the river about 10km away along the Danube cycle path.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After showers, we walked back into the old town for tea. Despite being a very touristy place, food prices seemed cheap compared to Germany and we had another very good pizza sat looking at the main square.

                After a healthy breakfast of cold leftover pizza, we went out on our bikes again. Roz had read that the route between Melk and Krems was about the most scenic stretch of the Donau Radweg (Danube cycle path) and it proved to be the case. It is just under 25 miles between the two places.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-011.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We cycled down the river on the Southern side with the path mostly along the side of the river giving good views of the river and villages on the other side. Krems was a nice enough place to wander around for an hour before the journey back up the river on the Northern side. This route took us through a lot of the villages we had seen on the way down and was more interesting in my opinion. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have cycled other sections of the Danube in the past but today was far better than anything we have done previously. It was also cooler and cloudier than it has been for the last few days which made the cycling quite a bit easier and we were not too worn out by the time we returned to Melk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a couple of hours outside the tent watching the thunder storm that thankfully stayed on the other side of the river and then walked back into town for a beer. We ate our evening meal at the campsite guest house restaurant. This was an excellent meal in a superb location sat right next to the river. A very good end to what had been a very enjoyable day!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            Unfortunately, the peace and tranquility of the campsite was somewhat ruined when at 9:30 a large group of Irish builders turned up with their families. There were six vehicles towing four huge caravans, a huge number of children, two rabbits and a dog. They made an unbelievable amount of noise as they got their vans into position but thankfully did all quieten down by about 10:30. They have totally taken over half the campsite. Oh well, we are leaving tomorrow anyway.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 31st May</span>
                We were up reasonably early and in no hurry to leave so we had a final bike ride along the river before departing. We both went to Pöchlarn - Roz went directly there and I went a slightly longer route to complete my 600 mile target for May. We met at Pöchlarn and cycled back to Melk together. We had breakfast by the tent, packed everything into the car and were ready to leave by about 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">However, when we tried to leave the car would not start. We have had no electric supply in Melk so I have been charging my phone from the lighter socket. This together with the light coming on every time the boot is open appears to have totally drained the battery.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Fortunately, a large group of Irish builders had arrived at the campsite last night! They could not have been more helpful. No-one had jump leads, but a couple of them pushed the car out from where it was parked and then another towed it through the camp site until it started. We had had to totally unpack the boot to get the tow rope and tow hook thing but we were still on our way just after 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We only had 85 miles to drive today. We were heading to Sopron which is just over the border in Hungary and the journey took just under two hours. We had booked a studio apartment for two days and were able to check in as soon as we arrived at midday. We spent 30 minutes or so unpacking our stuff and sorting out the car before walking into town.
