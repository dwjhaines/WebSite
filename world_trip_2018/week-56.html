            We were up by 8:30 and after quick showers, walked back to the metro station in time for the 8:50 train to the airport. Again, we were through the airport quickly, got breakfast from Burger King and boarded the 10:55 Lufthanse flight back to Munich. It has been a very good week in Porto. It is a spectacular city, most of the football has been enjoyable and the beer excellent.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-307.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After an uneventful three hour flight, we landed back in Munich at 15:00 local time. We phoned up the hotel we had stayed at and they sent a shuttle bus to take us back to the car park. By 16:00 we had got the car back, filled up with petrol and were on our way to Landsberg am Lech, another of the towns on the romantic road. The journey took less than an hour and we easily found the apartment that we had booked just outside the old town. We were met at the apartment by the owner who showed us round and took our deposit, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out again by this time. We had showers and then walked into the centre of the old town which is only about ten minutes away. It is another very picturesque town with the usual selection of colourful buildings and small squares. We walked round the centre, had curry wurst from a fast food place, had a look at some of the options for cycling tomorrow and walked back to the apartment.

            We spent an hour or so this morning booking a couple of places in Italy for the next week. We had wondered about staying in Bavaria a bit longer but the weather here is pretty crap at the moment and looks a lot better on the other side of The Alps. We will drive straight through Austria and into Italy on Thursday and spend a few days getting down to Cesena where the first game of the Under 21's tournament is in a weeks time.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After our week in Portugal, it was a return to healthier activities today. There had been some rain this morning but it was dry by 10:00 so, after breakfast in the apartment, it was time to go out on our bikes again. We wanted to cycle out to Ammersee (Lake Ammer) which is about 12.5 miles away. We had a few problems finding the route out of Landsberg and were eventually shown the way by another cyclist who appeared to be in the police or something. He cycled out of Landsberg with us and pointed us in the direction of the lake but it was a longer route than we had planned meaning that we got to the lake after about 20 miles and then had another four or five miles cycling North to get to the place we were originally aiming for. We found the correct cycle route back easily enough but ended up doing a round trip of 37 miles which was a bit more than planned. The route was also hillier than the cycling we have been doing recently but it was still probably an easier ride than the one we did last week as the temperature was about 10° lower than it was then.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both back in the apartment by about 4pm and did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We went out and bought a huge take-away pizza for tea... and will probably be eating the remains of it for the next few days! We watched most of the Germany v Estonia game on the tv although this was not too exciting as Germany were 4 - 0 up after about 20 minutes. We went to bed before the end of the game.

            We were out on the bikes again today slightly earlier than yesterday. We had decided that we would cycle along the Romantic Road cycle route in the direction of Schongau. Once again, when we were looking at directions we were given help by a local and were sent off in a direction we did not want to go in. We were put on what is probably the easiest, flattest and most boring route to Schongau but this is not really what we wanted to do. We managed to correct ourselves and get back to the route which was on the opposite side of the Lech river but by this time we had already done nearly 13 miles and Roz was not keen on going so far today. 
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-308.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We found the route at Stadl and Roz decided here to follow the route back to Landsberg. I continued South along the route and did manage to get to Schongau. It was a tough ride as there was a very strong Southerly wind which I was cycling into and the route was going up-river. Inevitably the wind had dropped and changed direction a bit by the return journey but it was still a lot easier than the journey South. I got back to the apartment at about 3:30 having done 52 miles with over 3000 ft of ascent. Despite not wanting to go far, Roz still completed 30 miles on her trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the early evening, the weather had finally brightened up for the first time since we got here. We walked back into the old town at 6ish, took a few photos and went for a beer sat by the river. The restaurants in the old town were quite expensive so we walked back from there back past our apartment to a restaurant we had spotted when we first drove into Landsberg. We had excellent meals in there with a few wheat beers and were back in the apartment by 10:00.

            We checked out of the apartment at 9:40 and began our drive to Trento in Italy. We had chosen to stay here as it looks a nice enough town and is en route to Lake Garda where we will be staying on Saturday. The drive was very scenic as we drove down through the German, Austrian and Italian Alps. The German part of the trip was quite slow as it was not on motorways but getting stuck in traffic in somewhere as scenic as Garmisch-Partenkirchen was not the end of the world!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a stop for lunch at a scenic motorway picnic area once we were on the motorway in Austria, finally finishing the pizza from Tuesday night. From there, it was a fairly straight-forward drive through The Brenner Pass and down into Italy.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-309.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived in Trento at 3ish. The centre where our apartment is located is not accessible by car. We got as close to it as we could and Roz went off on foot to find the owner. He came back to the car and directed us to the multi-storey car park where we have to leave the car for the next couple of days. We had to make a couple of trips back and fore with bikes and luggage but it is not too far away. The apartment itself is very nice again and has an excellent terrace..... perfect for a few glasses of wine and also somewhere to lock up our bikes. It just about has a view of the near-by mountains.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After sorting out the luggage and and putting on washing we walked to the supermarket which is about a minute away to stock up on wine and other provisions. Wine is not expensive here - less than €2 a bottle in the supermarket. We had a few glasses on the terrace before going out to eat. We ate at a pizza restaurant that we had walked past a couple of times. Excellent pizzas and more cheap wine. We walked out to a craft beer bar for one drink before returning to the terrace to finish the wine that we had bought.

            Did not do much all morning but stayed in the apartment. I spent an hour or so applying for a job which was a slightly depressing thing to have to do but it is less than three weeks until we will be home now.

            <p class="diary-text">We went out sight-seeing after lunch. We had considered going out on our bikes but with the temperature reaching 35°c this afternoon, we decided that a short walk was a better option. The sights here are not that spectacular but it is a lovely old town to walk around with lots of nice buildings. We went to the main square with the cathedral on one side of it and then walked out to the river where we got a cable car up to Sardagna. This was quite a rickety unsafe looking thing but it got us there and back and the views from the top were very impressive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once we were back down, we walked out to the castle and then back to the apartment. We went out again at 5 and bought a few more bottles of wine which we took to the car to take with us when we leave. The rest of the evening was very similar to yesterday with a bit less wine. We had a few drinks on the terrace before going out to the same pizzeria that we had eaten in last night. We went for a walk around the main square where there was a band playing and hundreds of people involved in some sort of banquet on one of the roads coming off the square. We returned to the terrace for a few more glasses before bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th June</span>
            Leaving the apartment all took quite a bit of time this morning. I took both the bikes from the terrace down to the square that the terrace overlooks. We had one journey back to the car with most of the luggage then returned to the apartment for the final couple of pieces. We collected the bikes, cycled to the car park and reattached the bike rack to the car. It was about 11:30 by the time we finally left Trento.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-311.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We continued driving South to our next destination - Sirmione at the Southern end of Lake Garda. It was not that far and we could have done the journey in just over an hour. However, we chose not to use the toll roads and had a bit of confusion with the sat-nav a couple of times so it was about 1:30 when we arrived in Sirmione. We picked up the keys to the apartment from a central office and then had a five minute drive to the apartment itself. The apartment was being cleaned when we arrived but we were able to park the car and have lunch by the pool while we waited. Whereas the previous two places we had stayed were single privately owned apartments, this one  was in a block of about 20 with a swimming pool. We moved in at 3pm and it is another very nice place to stay with plenty of room again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out on our bikes at 4:30. We went up to the main part of Sirmione, a couple of miles from where we are staying. All very touristy and upmarket and not really our sort of place. We cycled a few more miles round the lake, parts of which were much nicer before heading back to the apartment, a round trip of just over 15 miles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The evening was similar to the previous two. We had a few drinks sat outside the apartment before walking to a pizzeria about five minutes away. This was a bit out of the way of the main tourist area so not as expensive but we still had very good pizzas with a couple of litres of house wine. A very enjoyable night out!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 16th June</span>
            We were up quite late last night so did not do a lot all morning. There is not a lot we want to do here anyway apart from cycling round the lake and it is too hot to spend a lot of time doing that, particularly in the middle of the day. </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-312.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz spent a few hours lying by the pool but I stayed in the apartment until I went out on my bike at about 2:30pm. I cycled the other way to the way we had gone yesterday but it was all quite similar, another round trip of about 15 miles. There is supposed to be a cycle path all the way round the lake and it is good in places but a lot of it is narrow and shared with pedestrians. In other parts it is non-existent which means cycling on the road. Still better than cycling at home but not quite up to German standards.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">When I got back, we had lunch in the apartment before we both went out for another 12 mile ride. We went the same way as yesterday and stopped for a beer on the way back in a small bar which just about had views of the lake. We were back in time for the opening game of the Under 21's tournament. We watched some of the game while starting on the wine again. We went back to the same restaurant as last night for another pizza and watched the end of the Italy v Spain game after we had eaten.
