            We were up by 8:30 and after quick showers, walked back to the metro station in time for the 8:50 train to the airport. Again, we were through the airport quickly, got breakfast from Burger King and boarded the 10:55 Lufthanse flight back to Munich. It has been a very good week in Porto. It is a spectacular city, most of the football has been enjoyable and the beer excellent.

            <p class="diary-text">After an uneventful three hour flight, we landed back in Munich at 15:00 local time. We phoned up the hotel we had stayed at and they sent a shuttle bus to take us back to the car park. By 16:00 we had got the car back, filled up with petrol and were on our way to Landsberg am Lech, another of the towns on the romantic road. The journey took less than an hour and we easily found the apartment that we had booked just outside the old town. We were met at the apartment by the owner who showed us round and took our deposit, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out again by this time. We had showers and then walked into the centre of the old town. It is another very picturesque town with the usual colourful buildings and small squares. We walked round the centre, had a look at some of the options for cycling tomorrow and walked back to the apartment.
