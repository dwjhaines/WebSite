            We were up by 8:30 and after quick showers, walked back to the metro station in time for the 8:50 train to the airport. Again, we were through the airport quickly, got breakfast from Burger King and boarded the 10:55 Lufthanse flight back to Munich. It has been a very good week in Porto. It is a spectacular city, most of the football has been enjoyable and the beer excellent.

            <p class="diary-text">After an uneventful three hour flight, we landed back in Munich at 15:00 local time. We phoned up the hotel we had stayed at and they sent a shuttle bus to take us back to the car park. By 16:00 we had got the car back, filled up with petrol and were on our way to Landsberg am Lech, another of the towns on the romantic road. The journey took less than an hour and we easily found the apartment that we had booked just outside the old town. We were met at the apartment by the owner who showed us round and took our deposit, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both totally worn out again by this time. We had showers and then walked into the centre of the old town which is only about ten minutes away. It is another very picturesque town with the usual selection of colourful buildings and small squares. We walked round the centre, had curry wurst from a fast food place, had a look at some of the options for cycling tomorrow and walked back to the apartment.

            We spent an hour or so this morning booking a couple of places in Italy for the next week. We had wondered about staying in Bavaria a bit longer but the weather here is pretty crap at the moment and looks a lot better on the other side of The Alps. We will drive straight through Austria and into Italy on Thursday and spend a few days getting down to Cesena where the first game of the Under 21's tournament is in a weeks time.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After our week in Portugal, it was a return to healthier activities today. There had been some rain this morning but it was dry by 10:00 so, after breakfast in the apartment, it was time to go out on our bikes again. We wanted to cycle out to Ammersee (Lake Ammer) which is about 12.5 miles away. We had a few problems finding the route out of Landsberg and were eventually shown the way by another cyclist who appeared to be in the police or something. He cycled out of Landsberg with us and pointed us in the direction of the lake but it was a longer route than we had planned meaning that we got to the lake after about 20 miles and then had another four or five miles cycling North to get to the place we were originally aiming for. We found the correct cycle route back easily enough but ended up doing a round trip of 37 miles which was a bit more than planned. The route was also hillier than the cycling we have been doing recently but it was still probably an easier ride than the one we did last week as the temperature was about 10Â° lower than it was then.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both back in the apartment by about 4pm and did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We went out and bought a huge take-away pizza for tea... and will probably be eating the remains of it for the next few days! We watched most of the Germany v Estonia game on the tv although this was not too exciting as Germany were 4 - 0 up after about 20 minutes. We went to bed before the end of the game.

            We were out on the bikes again today slightly earlier than yesterday. We had decided that we would cycle along the Romantic Road cycle route in the direction of Schongau. Once again, when we were looking at directions we were given help by a local and were sent off in a direction we did not want to go in. We were put on what is probably the easiest, flattest and most boring route to Schongau but this is not really what we wanted to do. We managed to correct ourselves and get back to the route which was on the opposite side of the Lech river but by this time we had already done nearly 13 miles and Roz was not keen on going so far today. 
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-308.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We found the route at Stadl and Roz decided here to follow the route back to Landsberg. I continued South along the route and did manage to get to Schongau. It was a tough ride as there was a very strong Southerly wind which I was cycling into and the route was going up-river. Inevitably the wind had dropped and changed direction a bit by the return journey but it was still a lot easier than the journey South. I got back to the apartment at about 3:30 having done 52 miles with over 3000 ft of ascent. Despite not wanting to go far, Roz still completed 30 miles on her trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">By the early evening, the weather had finally brightened up for the first time since we got here. We walked back into the old town at 6ish, took a few photos and went for a beer sat by the river. The restaurants in the old town were quite expensive so we walked back from there back past our apartment to a restaurant we had spotted when we first drove into Landsberg. We had excellent meals in there with a few wheat beers and were back in the apartment by 10:00.
