            We were up at 5:30, retrieved our gear from the dive centre, packed our bags and left the resort just before 6:00. We were sharing a minibus to Hilongos with a group of four others from England. The journey to Hilongos took about 90 minutes so we were there with an hour to spare before the 8:30 boat to Ubay on Bohol. We were on the boat just before 8:00 and it eventually left at about 9:15. This boat was not air-conditioned but was open at the sides so cool enough anyway. It was full but we all had seats and the journey passed reasonably quickly. We arrived in Ubay at 11:30 and were met by a car form Blue Star Dive Resort where we will spend the next couple of nights.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">It took about an hour to get to the resort where we checked into another nice room with balcony overlooking the sea. We wandered down to the dive centre to book dives for tomorrow and had lunch in the restaurant before spending an hour or so by the pool (this resort is a bit more up-market than Peter's). We could have dived this afternoon but had already decided that after diving for seven days on a row, we would have a day off and will probably only do one days diving here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do much for the rest of the day. Ate in the resort restaurant in the evening and were back in the room by 9.

            Two dives this morning. The diving here is ideal in that the dive sites are all close to the dive centre so there are no long boat rides. We dived three sites really. The first dive was Snapper Cave to Coral Garden which is right in front of the resort. We had our surface interval on the boat and did the second dive from COral Garden to Turtle Point. We dived with Chris who was from England and had only just learned to dive but was pretty good underwater. We were guided by Richard.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There is a lot less wind here and the sea is a lot calmer. Although the vis is not as good as it can be, it is a lot better than it was on Leyte which was very good to see. Both were wall dives. The cave at the start of the first was OK and we also saw a couple of turtles in the area around the cave as well as an electric clam. The second dive featured lots of turtles. I lost count but thought I saw 12. Roz counted 11. One area in particular, turtle point itself, there seemed to be turtles everywhere and you could see four or five at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had only planned to do one days diving here but back at the dive centre, Roz was keen to revisit Turtle Point. We found out that we are just about the only people diving tomorrow morning so can choose the site. We will do the 8:30 dive again before being picked up to transfer to Cabilao.
