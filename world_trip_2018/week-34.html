            We were up at 5:30, retrieved our gear from the dive centre, packed our bags and left the resort just before 6:00. We were sharing a minibus to Hilongos with a group of four others from England. The journey to Hilongos took about 90 minutes so we were there with an hour to spare before the 8:30 boat to Ubay on Bohol. We were on the boat just before 8:00 and it eventually left at about 9:15. This boat was not air-conditioned but was open at the sides so cool enough anyway. It was full but we all had seats and the journey passed reasonably quickly. We arrived in Ubay at 11:30 and were met by a car form Blue Star Dive Resort where we will spend the next couple of nights.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">It took about an hour to get to the resort where we checked into another nice room with balcony overlooking the sea. We wandered down to the dive centre to book dives for tomorrow and had lunch in the restaurant before spending an hour or so by the pool (this resort is a bit more up-market than Peter's). We could have dived this afternoon but had already decided that after diving for seven days in a row, we would have a day off and will probably only do one days diving here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do much for the rest of the day. Ate in the resort restaurant in the evening and were back in the room by 9.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 8th January</span>
            Two dives this morning. The diving here is ideal in that the dive sites are all close to the dive centre so there are no long boat rides. We dived three sites really. The first dive was Snapper Cave to Coral Garden which is right in front of the resort. We had our surface interval on the boat and did the second dive from Coral Garden to Turtle Point. We dived with Chris who was from England and had only just learned to dive but was pretty good underwater. We were guided by Richard.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">There is a lot less wind here and the sea is a lot calmer. Although the vis is not as good as it can be, it is a lot better than it was on Leyte which was a relief after the diving in the last week. Both were wall dives. The cave at the start of the first was OK and we also saw a couple of turtles in the area around the cave as well as an electric clam. The second dive featured lots of turtles. I lost count but thought I saw 12. Roz counted 11. One area in particular, turtle point itself, there seemed to be turtles everywhere and you could see four or five at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had only planned to do one days diving here but back at the dive centre, Roz was keen to revisit Turtle Point. We found out that we are just about the only people diving tomorrow morning meaning that if we dive, we can choose the site. We will do the 8:30 dive (at Turtle Point) before being picked up to transfer to Cabilao at midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"> After washing our gear and showering, the rest of the day was similar to yesterday. Lunch in the restaurant, the afternoon by the pool or on the balcony and our evening meal in the restaurant. Another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 9th January</span>
            We were up at 7:00 for breakfast and in the dive centre an hour later for an 8:30 departure. There were not so many people on the boat today. We were the only fun divers, there was a couple completing their open water course and a couple of snorkelers. We were guided by Ophe, from France.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-187.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">When I turned my air on for this dive, the hose of my octopus came away from the first stage. The staff said something about repairing it but it looks as if the hose needs replacing. They had spare regs on the boat so after changing them over, we got on with the dive. Once we were in the water, the dive was exactly what we had hoped for. We went straight to Turtle Point and had about an hour of our 72 minute dive looking at turtles. The dive centre manager reckoned his record here was 27 turtles and we matched that on this dive. This is the highest number of turtles we have ever seen on a single dive outside of Borneo. We did not see too much else as we were busy looking at the turtles but did see a couple of sea-snakes and a cuttle-fish. Twenty six of the turtles were green sea turtles but we did see one hawksbill right at the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the dive centre by 10:00 giving us a couple of hours to sort out our gear. We washed it and left it by the pool in the sun in an attempt to dry it as much as possible. By the time we had had showers and paid the bill, our transfer had already turned up. We left the room and collected our still wet gear and got into the minibus just as it started raining heavily. We left at about 11:40 and had a three hour drive to the port at Mocpoc We got the driver to stop at a supermarket so we could stock up on a few things for the next five days (rum and diet coke mainly) and made it to the port just before 3. There was a boat from Polaris dive resort waiting to take us across to Cabilao, a journey of about half an hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We checked into our room. Nice enough room again but no sea view this time. We left our luggage and went to check into the dive centre. The girl who checked us in did not have too much of a clue what was going on but she did manage to find a replacement hose for my regs and the dive staff were able to fit it for me. We booked ourselves onto the boat for tomorrow mornings dive. We ordered our evening meals and returned to the room to unpack.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. We went back to the restaurant for 7:30. The restaurant here is very good. There are tables overlooking the beach, they do excellent pizzas and they sell Wiehensteffan wheat beer at a reasonable price. I think we will be quite content here for the next few days! After eating, we had a couple more drinks on our balcony while looking at our videos from the last few days before going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 10th January</span>
            Breakfast in the restaurant before the first dive of the day at 9:00. Here there are two dives each day, one at 9am and the other at 2pm. There are 15 rooms at the resort but although there seem to be a few other people staying here, there are not many people diving. There was only one other diver on the boat this morning, Sebastian from Germany. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The morning dive at Chapel Point was pretty good. It was another wall dive. The weather was not great when we went in the water and there was not much light down there but despite this, the visibility was a lot better than it has been in the last couple of places. Lito, our guide, seemed a bit more enthusiastic about looking for things than some of the guides we have had recently so we were shown lots of small crabs and shrimps. The wall itself was spectacular and the coral at the top very nice again. By the time we had surfaced, it was raining heavily again. The dive sites here are close to the resort again so we were back by 10:30 and had a few hours in the room before the second dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-188.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The rain didn't really stop all day so it was still dark and wet when we went out for the second dive at 2pm. We dived House Reef North so still went out by boat and ended up right in front of the resort. Sebastian had been put off by the weather so it was just me and Roz with Lito this afternoon. This was another very good dive despite the weather. It was another wall dive with lots of small stuff to see again. We saw a pygmy sea horse down at about 28m (one that I could actually see despite my eyesight!), a ghost pipe fish, loads of small shrimps & crabs and a leaf scorpion fish in the shallows at the end. Again, Lito was an excellent guide and was not as desperate to get out of the water as soon as 60 minutes were up unlike some of the guides at Peter's!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Still raining heavily when we got back to the dive centre. Not too much to do here when it is raining. Spent the rest of the afternoon reading, editing photos or sitting in the restaurant using the WiFi. We had a similar evening to yesterday, had a couple of beers with our meal and rum on the balcony while looking at photos.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 11th January</span>
            Much better weather today. Still a lot of cloud and not too much sun but at least the rain had stopped. Apart from the weather, it was a similar day to yesterday. We were joined today by David and Kim and were guided again by Lito. The first dive at 3-Coco was a very similar dive to the ones we did yesterday i.e. steep wall with lots of small stuff. We saw another pygmy sea-horse and were also surprised by a large green sea turtle that nearly swam into me as it came out from the wall.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-189.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We wandered out of the resort between the dives for a walk round one of the local villages but there was not too much of any interest. Came back via the lighthouse and past another couple of dive resorts.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive after lunch was at Lighthouse. This was a bit different to the other sites here in that the top of the wall was at about 18m with a sloping sandy area leading down to it. The additional sand meant that the vis was not so good and there was also strong currents particularly at the start of the dive. We still went straight down to 30m to see another pygmy sea-horse and there was also an electric clam in a small cave down there. Plenty more shrimps and crabs and a couple of nudibranchs as we worked our way back up to the top of the reef.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">A quieter evening tonight. We had pizzas in the restaurant but had a night off the beer and rum.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 12th January</span>
            Two more dives today. Same group as yesterday and guided by Lito again. First dive in the morning was at Looc. This was similar to yesterday afternoon's dive i,.e. a small cave at about 30m containing an electric clam, a nudibranch and an ornate ghost pipe fish, followed by a wall and a sandy slope. The second dive was at Cambaquiz Slope I. This was different to the other sites we have dived here in that there was no wall, just a sandy slope with a lot of sea grass. Saw a few things including another ghost pipe fish but it felt as if there should have been more down there. Not the best dive of our stay here.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-190.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">This was our last dive here as we are planning a day off tomorrow. The dives here have been good but six is probably enough as the sites are quite repetitive and all seem to have roughly the same selection of shrimps and crabs. A lot of the tiny stuff that Lito has been finding is too small to see anyway and the sites do not seem to have much in the way of normal reef fish. It has still been a very good place to come to.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We washed our dive gear and hung it up to dry at the dive centre but did not do much else for the rest of the afternoon. We had pizzas again in the evening sat by the sea. We had a few wheat beers with the meal and carried on drinking rum from the bar until it closed at 11. Just before the bar closed, we ordered a few more drinks and some ice and then carried on drinking our own rum while following the football. I managed to find a stream of the Preston v Swansea game so we stayed there until the football finished just before 1am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 13th January</span>
            Another quiet Sunday where we did not do a lot. We were up late and had the remains of last night's pizza for a late breakfast/early lunch (the staff at the restaurant are happy to keep it and warm it up again the next day). The rest of the day was spent lying in the sun, reading or editing photos from the last couple of days diving. We booked our transfer back to Cebu for tomorrow and just about got our dive gear dried. We ate at the resort restaurant again in the evening, paid the bill for the last five days and had an early night.
