            Three more days at home. Got our dive gear sorted out and packed and got the rest of the things completed from the ToDo list. Had just about everything done by Wednesday afternoon so could have left 24 hrs earlier! We went out to The Star for  a meal on Wednesday before meeting Hamish for a few drinks in The Swan.

            The start of the second part of our trip. We are heading for Mabul, an island off the Malaysian part of Borneo. This will involve a flight to Kuala Lumpa, an overnight stay there, a three hour flight from KL to Tawau on Saturday, an  overnight stay in Semporna (50 miles from Tawau) and a boat transfer to Mabul on Sunday. Mabul is one of our favourite places to dive from in the world but is a lot of hassle to get to if going on a two week holiday.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We said goodbye to Wes and left Kingsclere just after 1pm. First stop was  Aleks and Andi's house where I transferred ownership of my car to Luka who is "borrowing" it for the next six months or so. Luka then drove us to Heathrow where we arrived at about 16:30. We had an hour to wait before we could check in for our 21:35 flight to KL. After checking in, we went through security and straight to the Premium Plaza lounge which we had free passes for from Amex.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had three hours of wine and vodka in the lounge before boarding the flight which left on time. A few more glasses of wine on the plane before falling asleep.

            We landed at Kuala Lumpa International Airport on time at 17:35. We have never liked KLIA and it was a particularly poor experience today. It took 30 minutes just to get to immigration with a long walk and a trip on the "AeroTrain". It then took another hour of queuing to get through. Although it only took a minute or two for us to get our passports stamped, we were in a long queue, mainly with non-Malaysian Asians who all seemed to have problems with their documents. We finally got through immigration at about 19:10. We had booked the Tune Hotel at KLIA 2 which is at the new Low Cost Carrier Terminal (where we will be flying from tomorrow). After some confusion we got the free shuttle bus between the two terminals and were finally dropped a few minutes walk from the hotel about two hours after landing.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The Tune Hotel is a budget hotel although the room we had this time was considerably bigger than the ones we have stayed in before at the older LCCT version. We walked back to the airport to eat. KLIA 2 is a much better terminal than the main one and it still has a food hall type place (mainly for airport staff) that does excellent, cheap, Indian food. After eating, we wandered round the shopping centre that is attached to the airport but there was not too much else to do so we went back to the hotel for an early night.

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 20th October</span>
            We woke at 8:30 after a pretty good night's sleep. We walked back to the Indian food hall for our first roti canai of the trip for breakfast
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">After an hour or so back in the hotel, we checked out at 10:30..... just before finding out that our flight had a 40 minute delay. We proceeded to the airport anyway, printed our boarding passes, gave in our luggage and went and sat in the departure area to wait for the flight. The flight departed just about on time (the new 40 minutes late time) at 13:10 and landed in Tawau three hours later. We were met at the airport by a minibus from Scuba Junkie and had a 50 mile drive to Semporna where we checked into the Scuba Junkie Lodge. This is fairly basic backpacker type accommodation but is just over the road from the dive centre where we need to be at about 7:15 tomorrow morning.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have spent quite a bit of time in Semporna but there is not a lot to do here. The only reason to come here is the diving in this area or to transfer to Mabul. We had a wander round the area by the hotel and bought a few things we want to take to Mabul before going out to eat. The one thing Semporna does have is good Indian restaurants. We ate at the same place we have eaten many times before and returned to the room to follow the evening's football matches.
