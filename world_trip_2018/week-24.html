            We were up before 7:00, had a final breakfast of roti canai, collected our wet-suits and were picked up by mini-bus to take us back to Tawau airport. We shared the mini-bus with the three Swedes and Florian, a German also heading for Derawan. We checked in for our 10:30 flight to Tarawan in Indonesia without any problems and had an hour or so to wait for the flight. The MAS Wings flight left on time and we were in Tarawan about 40 minutes after taking off.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Once through immigration, we had all the usual problems that you get with Indonesian ATM's. Half of them do not work or give you incomprehensible error messages. When you do find one that works, the largest note is equal to about £2.50 meaning that the machines can only dispense about £60 as this is the maximum number of notes that it can handle. UK banks get suspicious when you repeatedly try and take out £60 and are prone to canceling cards. We needed to take out about £400 as we will not see an ATM again for two weeks at a time. Eventually, we all got out enough money although Florian had his card swallowed in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were joined by Kate and Alex but lost Florian who had to go off to a bank in an attempt to retrieve his lost card. Seven of us were taken in two cars to the port via a supermarket and a phone shop to buy Indonesian SIM cards. We were joined by another couple at the port (Sarah and Reece) and eventually by Florian again (who had somehow managed to get his card back) and after a bit of waiting around, were all on the boat to Derawan by about 1:30.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-124.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been told that the journey would take 3 - 4 hours depending on the conditions but were there by just after 4pm. After a short briefing about the diving here, we were shown to our rooms. The whole dive resort consists of eight rooms all built on stilts over the sea. The rooms are all really nice and and the views from the balconies superb. This is probably the place where we will stay the longest on the whole trip as we are going to be staying here for the next two weeks. We have thought of trying to come here in the past but have been put off by the amount of effort needed to get here. Now we are here we may as well stay a while!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We set up all our gear in the dive centre (which is about a 30 second walk from our room) and were taken for a walk around the village by Theresa, one of the managers here. We had been warned that the village was very basic and that there is not much here but there were a few shops and restaurants and the place had a much nicer feel to it that the village on Mabul. It certainly seems a lot cleaner. Whereas the resort in Mabul had its own restaurant with all our meals included, here we will be eating out every night. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had watched the sunset, we went out to eat at one of the restaurants that had been recommended to us. Indonesian food is not great at the best of times but at places where there are not many tourists, the food can be very basic and this was the case tonight. I don't think the food is going to be the highlight of our stay here!
            </p>           
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th October</span>
            We were both up by 6:30 and had half an hour sitting on our balcony trying to spot turtles coming up for air. We are close enough to the water to actually hear them breathing in!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our first day of diving here was the local dive sites around Derawan. You do three dives a day here and as the dives today were local, we were back at the resort between each dive. The day started with breakfast in the "chill out" area at 07:00. They have two boats here and the ten of us that arrived yesterday were all on the same boat while everyone else went off to a different island. We were in a group with Reece and Sarah who are both instructors and today we were led by Theresa. We were all down at the jetty by 7:45 and the boats left at 8:00.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-125.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived at Macro Mania, Ghost Wreck and Derawan Reef Deep. All three dives were fairly similar with the reef going down to about 20 - 25m. As with Mabul, most of the diving here is looking for small stuff although there is probably not as much to see here as in Mabul. All the dives had enough however and it was an easy, enjoyable days diving. We saw a lot of nudibranchs and there did seem to be a bigger variety of them on each dive than in Mabul including some we have not seen before. Theresa was very keen on finding tiny shrimps and other small stuff that I now struggle to see but there is enough around for us to find on our own anyway. On the third dive, Reece found a tiny mosaic octopus which is something we have not seen before. Good long dives today as well with each one being over 65 minutes. Not a great day for turtles but we did see one on the second dive and seven on the third although most of these were sleeping on the sand as we were doing our safety stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was an early end to the day today. We started earlier than in Mabul and this together with the short boat rides meant that we had finished diving by 4pm. Another quiet evening and another not very good meal. We went for another walk through the village  after eating but were back in the room by 9:00. Our perfect balcony was spoiled somewhat by loud karaoke blaring out from a restaurant at the end of the next pier when we got back but thankfully this did quieten down by about 10:30 so not too big a problem.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 31st October</span>
            In the same way that the reason for going to Mabul is to dive at Sipadan, the main reason for coming to Derawan is to dive at Sangalaki and other islands in the area. Today was our first day at Sangalaki. We left Derawan after breakfast at 8:00 and had about an hours boat journey to get to Sangalaki. Sangalaki is the most famous of the islands and is renowned for its manta rays. We knew there had been lots in the area a couple of days ago so had high expectations when we arrived.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-126.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived at The Wall, Manta Parade and The Wall to Manta Tease, although all three dives were in roughly the same area on the North of the island. The first dive was disappointing as we spent the whole time waiting around the manta cleaning stations and not one turned up. In between the first and second dives, we were able to snorkel from the beach with baby black-tip reef sharks swimming around in the shallows. Before the start of the second dive there were mantas feeding at the surface. We snorkeled with them for ten minutes or so before going in. For the first 20 minutes of the dive we could still see them at the surface. This was not the best of dives we have had with mantas but it was still a spectacular sight. Although we did not see them again for the rest of the dive, they were around the boat when we came back up and we had more time snorkeling with them before lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was probably the best of the day. We had given up looking for manta on this dive and concentrated instead on looking at the reef. Plenty of hard coral in good condition and more fish than we have seen on any dive here so far. We also had a few minutes with a hawksbill turtle towards the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the jetty by about 5pm. Our evening meal was the best we have had since getting here. We ate at the same place we had eaten at last night but they had chicken sate on the menu tonight which was a huge improvement on the food we had there previously. Could hardly hear the karaoke tonight so a better evening all round.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-127.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st November</span>
            Three dives today at Maratua, another island about an hour away by boat. We were down to eight divers on our boat (Manta) today as Kate and Alex had been moved to the other boat (Pygmy). After two days of being led by Theresa, today our group of four were guided by Moa, a Swedish instructor.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All three dives today were very good and, in my opinion, it was the best days diving we have had since getting here. The first dive was a wall dive at Hanging Gardens. The wall was spectacular with plenty to see again. Dive two was at Fusilier Paradise. This was more of a sloping reef and it had loads of life on it. It had some very nice coral, lots of reef fish including bump-heads, the smallest juvenile sweet-lips we have ever seen and eight turtles including one hawksbill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive of the day was at Turtle Traffic which as the name suggests featured plenty of turtles. Roz counted 21 on this dive, again with one hawksbill. Roz's Turtle Count now up to 254 since arriving in Malaysia. The weather was pretty poor today being mainly overcast and with some rain. Two of the Swedes missed the third dive due to being too cold and/or tired. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on Derawan by 5pm and had the usual routine of washing equipment, showers and downloading photos before going out to eat. Once again, we had a reasonably good meal in the restaurant that we have eaten in the last couple of nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 2nd November</span>
            Todays dives were at Kakaban, the third and final island that we will dive from Derawan. The day was similar to all the others with an 8:00 departure and a boat trip of just over an hour to the first dive site. Same peopple on the boat as yesterday and once again, our group of four was led by Moa.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Meditation Wall. This was a very good wall dive again and the weather was better today so everything was a lot more colourful than it was yesterday. There were a couple of white-tip sightings - I saw one that no-one else saw and Reece and Sarah also was one later in the dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-128.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">During the first surface interval, we all visited the non-stinging jelly fish lake. <i>"The lake is located in the middle of the island, and was once a lagoon (around 2 million years ago) Over 1000s of years the rocks rose above the sea level creating the lake, which again over 1000s of years turned from salt water to brackish water. As a result the jelly fish and other marine life within the lake evolved separately from the rest of the world creating a truly unique habitat of stingless Jellyfish!"</i>
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The jellyfish have no predators in the lake so do not need to sting anything to defend themselves. As a result of this, over the years they have become "stingless". It was a five minute walk from the jetty to the lake where we were able to snorkel with thousands of jellyfish safe in the knowledge that we would not be stung. It was a slightly odd experience but once used to the sight of them it was also quite a spectacular and unique one.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive two was at Barracuda Point and was quite an eventful dive. There were strong currents and a lot of the more interesting action was deep so just about everyone in our group went into deco at some point. There were white-tips swimming around on the plateau and younger sharks under the table coral as well as a big school of jacks that were a bit too deep for us to get a proper look at. There was a devil ray as we got back to the wall that Roz and I missed and an electric clam that we could just about see as we came up the wall.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second surface interval involved most of us sitting around getting bitten by horse-fly type things. They had been around when we got back to the jetty after swimming with the jellyfish and for some reason, the boat returned to the same spot for lunch despite requests from everyone to stay out at sea. Four of us spent an hour in the water trying to avoid them but most of us, Roz in particular, got several nasty bites.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was at Crack In, another spectacular wall. There was a large school of bump-heads swimming beneath us as we went down and we saw a hawksbill turtle a few minutes later (our first and only turtle of the day).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, Roz's bites were causing her quite a lot of discomfort. The fact that we had spent both surface intervals in the sun probably did not help but she did not feel like going out to eat. I went out and bought two pot noodles (or Pop Mee's as they are known here) which we ate in the "chill out" area. Probably a better meal than we had the first two nights here. Karaoke blaring out from two different venues tonight until about 23:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 3rd November</span>
            Roz feeling better this morning although the swelling from her bites has still not gone down. Well enough to go diving again however! 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-129.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Another trip to Sangalaki today. The eight of us from yesterday were joined by Steve and Clare and once again, our group of four was led by Moa. The diving today was pretty good again but we did not see a single manta which is the main reason to go to Sangalaki. Before the first dive, Moa did a current check and came up saying there was no current. I overheard one of the other guides saying "no current, no manta" and this proved to be correct.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The dives today were at The Wall, Manta Parade and Manta Run. They were still all enjoyable dives despite the lack of mantas. On the first two dives, there was very nice coral, there were plenty of fish and we saw a hawksbill turtle on each of them. By the start of the third, the current picked up a bit so we did quite a fast drift through Manta Run. Still no manta but we did have a few minutes with a large green turtle. The end of the dive was in a small area where there was a spiny devil fish and I also found a tiny black frog fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at what has become our usual restaurant. Not only was the food OK, they got our order correct and the food arrived quickly. We had planned on having a few drinks tonight but Roz is on anti-histamines for her bites so decided to put it off for a night or two. As the clocks have now gone back at home, the football did not start until 11pm today. Neither of us could be bothered to stay awake. No karaoke tonight from either side of us which was a relief.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th November</span>
            We were down in numbers today as Steffan, Lucas, Florian and Sarah were not diving due to illness and/or having a day off before flying tomorrow.  Of the ten of us that arrived here last Monday, six are leaving tomorrow along with Steve and Clare. Steffan, Lucas and Peo are flying home, Florian is going to KK and Reece and Sarah have finished diving and are moving somewhere else. We were still diving with Reece and led again by Moa. Alex and Kate were back on our boat. It was a day of relatively local diving. We went to Samama island for the first two dives and back to Derawan for the third.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-130.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Samama is less than 30 minutes away by boat. The diving here is mainly macro again, although the second dive was a fast drift along the reef. There were a few interesting things to see including a pygmy pipe fish on the first dive. Not sure if we have ever seen this before. Also saw a "Picachu" nudibrach nearby and a few other nudibranchs again. The current had picked up by the time of the second dive so although we were supposed to be looking for smaller stuff, it was quite hard to look for things as we sped along the reef. Everyone else saw a pygmy sea-horse at the end of the dive but again, I am struggling to see the smaller things and was not even sure what people were looking at!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was back at Derawan and again there were a few things to see. There were several mantis shrimps around. We have seen lots of these before but the ones here are a lot smaller. Reece also found the first ornate ghost pipe fish we have seen since getting to Derawan. Not a great day for spotting turtles. Roz saw two on the second dive and one on the third although I only saw one of them. It was an earlier finish to the day so we could laze around on the balcony for a couple of hours for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We ate at our usual restaurant and then spent an hour or so in the chill out area talking to the Swedes as they leave at 5:30 tomorrow morning. We had a couple of drinks on our balcony before going to bed (orange vodka, about the best of the options when we were in Semporna a week ago) but it was still not a late night.
