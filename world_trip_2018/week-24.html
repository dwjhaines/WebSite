            We were up before 7:00, had a final breakfast of roti canai, collected our wet-suits and were picked up by mini-bus to take us back to Tawau airport. We shared the mini-bus with the three Swedes and Florian, a German also heading for Derawan. We checked in for our 10:30 flight to Tarawan in Indonesia without any problems and had an hour or so to wait for the flight. The MAS Wings flight left on time and we were in Tarawan about 40 minutes after taking off.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Once through immigration, we had all the usual problems that you get with Indonesian ATM's. Half of them do not work or give you incomprehensible error messages. When you do find one that works, the largest note is equal to about £2.50 meaning that the machines can only dispense about £60 as this is the maximum number of notes that it can handle. UK banks get suspicious when you repeatedly try and take out £60 and are prone to canceling cards. We needed to take out about £400 as we will not see an ATM again for two weeks at a time. Eventually, we all got out enough money although Florian had his card swallowed in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were joined by Kate and Alex but lost Florian who had to go off to a bank in an attempt to retrieve his lost card. Seven of us were taken in two cars to the port via a supermarket and a phone shop to buy Indonesian SIM cards. We were joined by another couple at the port (Sarah and Reece) and eventually by Floren again (who had somehow managed to get his card back) and after a bit of waiting around, were all on the boat to Derawan by about 1:30.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-124.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had been told that the journey would take 3 - 4 hours depending on the conditions but were there by just after 4pm. After a short briefing about the diving here, we were shown to our rooms. The whole dive resort consists of eight rooms all built on stilts over the sea. The rooms are all really nice and and the views from the balconies superb. This is probably the place where we will stay the longest on the whole trip as we are going to be staying here for the next two weeks. We have thought of trying to come here in the past but have been put off by the amount of effort needed to get here. Now we are here we may as well stay a while!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We set up all our gear in the dive centre (which is about a 30 second walk from our room) and were taken for a walk around the village by Theresa, one of the managers here. We had been warned that the village was very basic and that there is not much here but there were a few shops and restaurants and the place had a much nicer feel to it that the village on Mabul. It certainly seems a lot cleaner. Whereas the resort in Mabul had its own restaurant with all our meals included, here we will be eating out every night. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After we had watched the sunset, we went out to eat at one of the restaurants that had been recommended to us. Indonesian food is not great at the best of times but at places where there are not many tourists, the food can be very basic and this was the case tonight. I don't think the food is going to be the highlight of our stay here!
            </p>           
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th October</span>
            We were both up by 6:30 and had half an hour sitting on our balcony trying to spot turtles coming up for air. We are close enough to the water to actually hear them breathing in!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our first day of diving here was the local dive sites around Derawan. You do three dives a day here and as the dives today were local, we were back at the resort between each dive. The day started with breakfast in the "chill out" area at 07:00. They have two boats here and the ten of us that arrived yesterday were all on the same boat while everyone else went off to a different island. We were in a group with Reece and Sarah who are both instructors and today we were led by Theresa. We were all down at the jetty by 7:45 and the boats leave at 8:00.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-125.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived at Macro Mania, Ghost Wreck and Derawan Reef Deep. All three dives were fairly similar with the reef going down to about 20 - 25m. As with Mabul, most of the diving here is looking for small stuff although there is probably not as much to see here as in Mabul. All the dives had enough however and it was an easy, enjoyable days diving. We saw a lot of nudibranchs and there did seem to be a bigger variety of them on each dive than in Mabul including some we have not seen before. Theresa was very keen on finding tiny shrimps and other small stuff that I now struggle to see but there is enough around for us to find on our own anyway. On the third dive, Reece found a tiny mosaic octopus which is something we have not seen before. Good long dives today as well with each one being over 65 minutes. Not a great day for turtles but we did see one on the second dive and seven on the third although most of these were sleeping on the sand as we were doing our safety stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was an early end to the day today. We started earlier than in Mabul and this together with the short boat rides meant that we had finished diving by 4pm. Another quiet evening and another not very good meal. We went for another walk through the village  after eatingbut were back in the room by 9:00. Our perfect balcony was spoiled somewhat by loud karaoke blaring out from a restaurant at the end of the next pier when we got back but thankfully this did quieten down by about 10:30 so not too big a problem.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 31st October</span>
            In the same way that the reason for going to Mabul is to dive at Sipadan, the main reason for coming to Derawan is to dive at Sangalaki and other islands in the area. Today was our first day at Sangalaki. We left Derawan after breakfast at 8:00 and had about an hours boat journey to get to Sangalaki.Sangalaki is the most famous of the islands and is renowned for its manta rays. We knew there had been lots in the area a couple of days ago so had high expectations when we arrived.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-126.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We dived at The Wall, Manta Parade and The Wall to Manta Tease, although all three dives were in roughly the same area on the North of the island. The first dive was disappointing as we spet the whole time waiting around the manta cleaning stations and not one turned up. In between the first and second dives, we were able to snorkel from the beach with baby black-tip reef sharks swimming around in the shallows. Before the start of the second dive their were mantas feeding at the surface. We snorkeled with them for ten minutes or so before going in. For the first 20 minutes of the dive we could still see them at the surface. This was not the best of dives we have had with mantas but it was still a spectacular sight. Although we did not see them again for the rest of the dive, they were around the boat when we came back up and we had more time snorkeling with them before lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was probably the best of the day. We had given up looking for manta on this dive and concentrated instead on looking at the reef. Plenty of hard coral in good condition and more fish than we have seen on any dive here so far. We also had a few minutes with a hawksbill turtle towards the end of the dive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the jetty by about 5pm. Our evening meal was the best we have had since getting here. We ate at the same place we had eaten at last night but they had chicken sate on the menu tonight which was a huge improvement on the food we had there previously. Could hardly hear the karaoke tonight so a better evening all round.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st November</span>
            Three dives today at Maratua, another island about an hour away by boat. We were down to eight divers on our boat (Manta) today as Kate and Alex had been moved to the other boat (Pygmy). After two days of being led by Theresa, today our group of four were guided by Moa, a Swedish instructor.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All three dives today were very good and, in my opinion, it was the best days diving we have had since getting here. The first dive was a wall dive at Hanging Gardens. The wall was spectacular with plenty to see again. Dive two was at Fusilier Paradise. This was more of a sloping reef and it had loads of life on it. Nothing particularly remarkable but some nice coral, lots of reef fish and eight turtles including one hawksbill.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive of the day was at Turtle Traffic which as the name suggests featured plenty of turtles. Roz counted 21 on this dive, again with one hawksbill. Roz's Turtle Count now up to 254 since arriving in Malaysia. The weather was pretty poor today being mainly overcast and with some rain. Two of the Swedes missed the third dive due to being too cold and/or tired. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back on Derawan by 5pm and had the usual routine of washing equipment, showers and downloading photos before going out to eat. Once again, we had a reasonably good meal in the restaurant that we have eaten in the last couple of nights.
