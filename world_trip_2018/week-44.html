            Monday is still changeover day here. Both the Spanish and French groups had left by the time we got up leaving just us and Waldo who is Welsh and arrived yesterday. On the boat with us was Rocky who is still our guide, Emilie the new instructor here and Jordon. Todays diving was at Maratua but once again the trip was cut short due to the conditions. We were able to do two dives this time before returning to Derawan for the third.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The two dives at Maratua were superb. Today the dives were either side of low tide, the best time for spotting turtles. On the first dive at Fusilier Paradise we saw 49. On the second at Turtle Traffic, we saw another 69. These were the second and third most turtles we have seen on single dives and took Roz's turtle count for the trip to over 1000. We did also see a big school of barracuda on the first dive but most of the time was just looking at the turtles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch on the pier near Turtle Traffic before returning to Derawan for the third dive. This was at Macro Mania again. Not too much to see here apart from a couple of peacock mantis shrimps an octopus and two juvenile batfish. Again we went snorkeling with the turtles when we came back. There are an incredible number of them right in front of the resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 19th March</span>
            Three dives around Derawan today and probably the best days diving we have had at Derawan itself. There were eight new arrivals yesterday making a total of eleven divers. We were all on the big boat and we gained Waldo in our group, still led by Rocky. Because the dives were local, it was back to the resort between each one.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-246.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive was at Tortoruga. We keep being told how good some of these sites are for macro but we have not really seen much so far. Today we did see a small thorny sea-horse and a flamboyant cuttle-fish, the first one of these that had been seen here since Scuba Junkie opened three years ago. Because we were diving at low tide we also saw lots of turtles, Roz counted another thirteen. Some of these were very laid back and not bothered by us at all. They seemed very happy to pose for photos as they were being cleaned. An excellent dive!  
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive at Ghost Wreck was also very good. Rocky had hurt his foot yesterday so we were led by Jordon on this dive. The first half of the dive was OK although we did not see as much macro stuff. Jordon is very good at finding things that are too small for me to see! The second half of the dive was brilliant. The current picked up and took us at quite a speed over part of the reef that we had not seen before. The coral here seemed very healthy and we had plenty more turtle sightings (another 10).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at the resort for lunch and then dived Macro Mania again. We were with Jordon again and it was a better dive than when we had done it with Rocky. Not really sure what it is about Rocky but there is something about his decision making and the way he guides that means dives are not as good as they could be. Today we ended the dive by the jetty which was an excellent area with a lot of nudibranchs around it whereas when we dived it previously, we turned around just as we were getting there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back in time for another snorkel with the turtles. There seem to be a lot more here than when we were last time. We could see six at the same time at one point. We ate at the usual restaurant with Waldo and Thomas, a German who arrived yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 20th March</span>
            An excellent days diving today with more turtles than we have ever seen in a single day. We were on the big boat today for the first time since we arrived last week. We are down to 10 divers now as Antonela, who arrived on Monday, perforated her ear-drum on her first day here and will not be diving again. The smaller boat went to Sangalaki while we went to Maratua again.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">On the boat today was a Chinese couple, Roland and Xuege who were completing their advanced course and Thomas. Thomas learnt to dive in the German Navy thirty years ago and has a lot of experience but when he left the Navy he was given a CMAS level 1 certification. This means that despite his experience, he is only officially certified to 18m and Scuba Junkie would not let him go deeper without doing the deep course. This meant he was doing the first dive with Moa and Roland and Xuege. He joined us half way through the first dive and stayed with us for the second and third. We were guided today by Emilie - the first time since she started here that she has guided customers unsupervised!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-247.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The dives were at Hanging Garden, Fusilier Paradise and Turtle Traffic. All three dives were very turtley with Roz counting 36, 56 and 50 turtles respectively. We saw the big school of barracuda again on the second dive and there was plenty of other stuff around as well as the turtles. These sort of dives were the reason we came back to Derawan a second time and we have already seen a lot more turtles than on our first visit here last year.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort, instead of snorkeling, we went for another dive in the area in front of the resort. We had been told that there was a harlequin shrimp somewhere down there so we went in with the air that we had left from the previous dive and spent about half an hour looking for it without success. We had ten minutes or so with the turtles (another nine added to the turtle count) before swimming back to the jetty. This was Roz's 2000th dive. Not the best dive of the day but all quite enjoyable nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Usual restaurant again for tea. Not sure what has happened there but for about the fifth night in a row the service was very good. Good food as well and back in the room by about 8:00.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-248.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 21st March</span>
            Back to Sangalaki today for our three dives. We gained Waldo and Phillip on the big boat. Waldo joined us and Thomas in the group led by Rocky again. The diving today was good without being as spectacular as on some days here. We did see manta on all three dives - two on the first and second and three on the third - but the sightings were quite brief as the mantas swan past us. There were two black-tips swimming around just before we saw the manta on the first dive and we added one turtle to the count, a very small hawksbill on the third dive (my 2000th) along Manta Run.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">Roz went snorkeling with the turtles again when we got back but I could not be bothered. Before eating we went for a walk along the beach. We had been told by Emilie and another couple about turtles laying eggs on the beach in the evening. We walked to the end of the island and had a look along the beach but there was no sign of any turtle activity so we gave up and went to eat. In the restaurant we ate with Antonela and Phillip, the couple who had seen a turtle yesterday on the beach. After eating, Roz went off with them to the spot they had seen the turtle yesterday. The same turtle was there again having just laid eggs and was on her way back down to the sea. There was also a ranger there who told them that she had not laid eggs yesterday (probably because of the presence of Antonela and Phillip!) but had come back again to do so this evening. The three of them watched her going back into the sea before returning to the resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 22nd March</span>
            We had been put on the boat to Kakaban today but when the destination of the other boat was changed from Sangalaki to Maratua, we asked if we could swap. This would mean that our last two days diving here were both at Maratua, which we were perfectly happy with. There were only eight divers left at the resort today as Roland and Xuege were leaving. We were on the boat with an Indonesian family - Jane who is a staff instructor on Gili Air and her parents. Egi and Igo were the guides. We were in a group of three with Jane, led by Igo. We had a bit of a rough trip out to Maratua and the weather was the worst we have had in the last couple of weeks although it had cleared up for the journey home.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-249.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">All three dives were excellent again. We did not see the barracuda at Fusilier Paradise on the first dive but did see 26 turtles. The second dive at Turtle Traffic was another very turtley dive with Roz counting 75. I thought I saw over 80 but either way it was the second most we have ever seen on a single dive. The third dive was at Gusung Pal. Not as many turtles on this dive, only six, but did see another very small hawksbill. There were another two hawksbills on the dive and lots of fish all over the site.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">My camera flooded again on the first dive. Again, the camera is OK and I did have the S95 with me so was able to take pictures on the second and third dives. The o-ring for the TG-5 is damaged and it is becoming unusable. I have ordered a replacement and it should be at home by now but that is not much use for the next couple of weeks. It looks as if I will have to continue to use the S95 for the rest of our time in S. E. Asia. Not the end of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had another 30 minutes or so snorkeling with the turtles when we got back (including a search around the jetty to retrieve our room key that Roz had dropped off the pier this morning!). We ate at the usual place with Thomas, Antonela and Phillip and then all walked to the turtle conservation centre where Antonela had been told that we would be able to look at turtle hatch-lings. As it was, the ranger was not there and apparently there are no hatch-lings there anyway so we gave up on that and walked back to the resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 23rd March</span>
            We were down to four divers on the trip to Maratua today. The Indonesians left yesterday and Waldo was not diving for some reason. Me, Roz and Thomas were led by Rocky with Phillip also on the boat led by Emilie. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We could not do the first dive at Fusilier Paradise as there was a fishing boat already there so we changed to Hanging Gardens instead. The dive was quite good with another 16 turtles. Second dive was at Mid Reef. We have not dived here before but it is the next site along from Gusung Pal and very similar. We were not that pleased with this choice of site but the dive was OK. The were only three turtles but we saw a few nudibranchs, a robust ghost pipe-fish and the same school of bump-head parrot fish that we had seen yesterday.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-250.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We are not sure where the third dive was going to be but it was going to be somewhere other than Turtle Traffic for some reason. It was the perfect time to be diving the site as it was low tide and it was a real shame not to go there particularly as it was our last dive and the site that we really wanted to go to. After a bit of an argument between Roz and Emilie, Emilie changed her mind and agreed that we could go there. This proved to be a good decision as we saw more turtles than we have ever seen before on a single dive, the first time we have counted over 100. Roz counted 119 in total beating the previous highest total of 92 at the same site last year. Everyone knew Roz was counting and at one point the six of us were drifting along the reef with everyone pointing at turtles in all directions. An incredible dive and a superb way to finish our diving here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tide was too low for snorkeling when we got back. At 6:30 we went upstairs and had a few beers before joining everyone else drinking on the jetty. After a couple more there, we went to eat with Phillip and Antonela and then continued drinking upstairs again with Waldo and most of the staff. This turned into a bigger session than planned and we did not get to bed until sometime after 1:30.
