            The two boat dives today were at Pulau Abadi and Serena Island. We had Fred and Betty back on the boat with us and were led as usual by Rinto. The first dive was pretty good again. We saw a couple of small flamboyant cuttle fish. They were a bit bigger than the one we saw a couple of days ago so it was actually possible to see what they were with the naked eye! We also saw tiger shrimps, a tozeuma shrimp, several little yellow box-fish and a huge school of cardinal fish hiding in a patch of sea urchins.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was not as good as any of the previous boat dives. We saw another couple of tozeuma shrimps and Roz counted eight ribbon eels but there was nothing too spectacular. The dive finished after 76 minutes, we think because Rinto got bored. Not the best of sites here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch back at the resort, we went and dived on the house reef again on our own. This was a much better dive than two days ago. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to find the smaller stuff, we concentrated on looking at the reef which is quite good in places. Although nothing too spectacular around here either, there was some nice coral and a lot of fish. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">A bit of variation in the evening. After eating, Rob, the owner, put on a DVD documentary of the underwater creatures of the Lembeh Straight, which we watched with Rob and Betty. Not back to the room until after 9!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 29th January</span>
            We did three dives today from the boat without coming back to the resort. Again, we had the boat to ourselves as Fred and Betty were not diving. The three sites today were Batu Lubang Besar again, Makawidey and Bianca.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">On the first dive, we spent a lot of time at about 20 - 25m looking for a blue-ring octopus, again without success. When we were looking here a couple of days ago, there were a few other things to look at in the area but they seemed to have gone so not the most exciting start to the days diving. When we did move back to the reef we did see the giant frog-fish again and another black giant frog-fish near-by so still not a bad dive.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-205.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive we were looking for jaw-fish. We had seen these in last nights video and the three Hungarians (the only other divers here apart from Fred, Betty and us) had seen them on a couple of dives. The jaw fish hold their eggs in their mouths and the ones here have eggs at the moment. I did see one briefly and Roz reckons she saw three but they were very quick sightings and certainly not for long enough to see if they had eggs in their mouths. Rinto spent a while trying to get one of them to come out until we told him to stop. I think they had had enough of divers in the last couple of days! There was enough other things to see on this dive including some excellent cardinal fish, a fingered dragonet, pipe fish, nudis, cuttle fish and moray eels. We also saw a school of juvenile barracuda in the shallows which we were not expecting.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was probably the best of the day. There were lots more nudis, a pygmy cuttle fish and a few other cuttle fish. We saw two ghost pipe-fish, one ornate and one robust and a few mandarin fish. There was a bright orange frog-fish to complete another good days diving.  
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back at the resort by about 4:30 and the usual quiet evening. 
            </p>

            Two boat dives again this morning at Serena Island and Jahir. Just us on the boat again today - Fred and Betty were put off by the forecast of big waves although the waves were no bigger than on any other day we have been here.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-206.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were not overjoyed with the choice for the first dive as the dive here a couple of days ago had not been great. We were assured that the conditions were better, there were less divers around and we would be at a different part of the site. We were not overly convinced but got on with it anyway. Not long after we went in, I found a robust ghost pipe fish. We were still photographing that when Rinto called us over to see what looked like a small red cuttle fish. After a few seconds, it started moving and changing colour we realised that it was a blue ringed octopus. This is the thing that I had most wanted to see when we came to Lembeh and the only thing that I had asked Rinto to find.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I had seen one briefly about 10 years ago and Roz had seen one that was eaten by another octopus before I got to it. This one was excellent and we spent about 15 minutes watching it moving around. It did not seem too bothered by us and eventually seemed to just go back to sleep on a rock having changed back to its red colour again. There was quite a few things to see on the rest of the dive but nothing that could compare to the octopus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">For the second dive we went back to Jahir as we had seen two hairy frog-fish here previously and we are unlikely to see one of those again for a while after we leave Lembeh. Rinto found a hairy frog-fish almost as soon as we were down to about 20m. This was not one of the ones we had seen here previously so there are at least three around this site. Again, we spent about 10 - 15 minutes watching it before moving on. Almost straight after leaving this one we were shown a really cute, small, red painted frog-fish. We also saw another (relatively large) flamboyant cuttle fish and plenty of all the usual nudis, etc. Two very good dives!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The wind was picking up a bit by the time we got back to the resort and had got a lot worse by the time we wanted to do our afternoon beach dive. We were told that the sea was probably too rough for beach diving and they did not seem keen to take the boat out so it was another afternoon in the room/on the balcony.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">At lunchtime we had booked our transfer back to Manado for Friday morning. As our afternoon dive was canceled, we changed the plan and will now try and do two boat dives on Friday morning and transfer to Manado, complete with wet dive gear, on Friday afternoon. Usual evening of dinner and back in the room by 8:00.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 31st January</span>
            A sad start to the day as we woke to the news that Wes had been taken to the vets yesterday and they had made the decision to have him put down. At his age this was was always a possibility at any time but upsetting news nevertheless.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-207.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">First dive of the day was at Papu Sungan. This got off to a bad start as I noticed water in my camera housing when I went to take my first photo of the dive. However, one of the good things about the TG5 is that the camera itself is waterproof to 15m so it does not matter if it gets wet. I returned to the boat anyway, rinsed camera and housing in fresh water and left them on a towel to dry. I had considered aborting the dive completely but decided to get back in (without the camera). I managed to find Roz and Rinto fairly easily and was still able to get a 72 minute dive. The site was pretty good again with plenty of nudibranchs and the first sea-horse we have seen here. Thankfully, it was a proper sea-horse and not another pygmy so I could actually see it. Also saw a couple of yellow box fish and a banded pipe fish carrying eggs.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second dive was at Teluk Kembahu II. This was an excellent dive with two small hairy frog-fish and a juvenile zebra batfish. Took the camera on this dive but the inside of the housing still had small amount of water in it so plenty of condensation and no photos! After lunch, although the conditions did not look a lot different to yesterday, we were able to do a third dive for 89 minutes on the house reef. This is not as good as the other sites in Lembeh but is still an enjoyable enough way of spending the afternoon. We went further round the corner again today and found a leaf scorpion fish and another yellow box fish - in the absence of turtles, Roz's "little yellow box fish count" has gone up to 16.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The same sort of evening as all the other ones. The Hungarians were night diving again so it was just us, the three Dutch guests and Rob, the owner who is also Dutch for dinner. Back in the room by just after 8 again.
