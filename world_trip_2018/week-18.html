            We were up a bit earlier than yesterday. After breakfast on the terrace, Roz and I went out on our bikes. We did a route of just over ten miles, similar to the one I did yesterday. When we got back, I went straight out again and did another 18 miles to Medulin and back. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the apartment and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon until we walked back into the old town just after 5:00. The only thing we really had left to see was the castle at the top of the hill in the old town. We decided to walk in so that we would be able to see the sunset while we were up there. As it was, there was too much cloud around for there to be any sort of sunset, but the views from there were very good, particularly of the amphitheatre. We stayed up there for an hour or so on the off-chance of the cloud clearing in time for the sunset but gave up at about 7:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back down the hill into the old town and came out at a bar/restaurant that I had seen yesterday that looked good. We decided to eat there and had another very good meal, probably our last meal of Ä‡evapi as we leave Croatia tomorrow. The others got through a few litres of wine while I stuck to the wheat beer. We walked back to the apartment by about 11:30.
