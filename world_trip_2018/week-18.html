            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 17th September</span>
            We were up a bit earlier than yesterday. After breakfast on the terrace, Roz and I went out on our bikes. We did a route of just over ten miles, similar to the one I did yesterday. When we got back, I went straight out again and did another 18 miles to Medulin and back. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had lunch in the apartment and did not do a lot for the rest of the afternoon until we walked back into the old town just after 5:00. The only thing we really had left to see was the castle at the top of the hill in the old town. We decided to walk in so that we would be able to see the sunset while we were up there. As it was, there was too much cloud around for there to be any sort of sunset, but the views from there were very good, particularly of the amphitheatre. We stayed up there for an hour or so on the off-chance of the cloud clearing in time for the sunset but gave up at about 7:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back down the hill into the old town and came out at a bar/restaurant that I had seen yesterday that looked good. We decided to eat there and had another very good meal, probably our last meal of ćevapi as we leave Croatia tomorrow. The others got through a few litres of wine while I stuck to the wheat beer. We walked back to the apartment by about 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 18th September</span>
            We just about managed to get all our luggage into the car and, after the owners of the apartment had checked everything and given us our deposit back, we left at 9:00. We stopped at Lidl to buy bread for lunch and then headed North to the border with Slovenia. We had another couple of stops, to buy our Slovenian vignette and to change our remaining Kuna into Euros and crossed the border at about 10:00. There were queues to get over the border but there were no checks on the Croatian side and the Slovenian border police seemed more efficient than at some places so we were still through in about ten minutes.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">From the border, we continued North towards the village of Postojna, famous for its karst cave system. We had booked tickets to visit the caves for 13:00. We were near the village just after 11:00 so went first to see the Renaissance castle that is built into a cave in Predjama a few miles away. We parked there and spent about 30 minutes looking at the castle but did not pay to go into the museum inside.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-107.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We drove from there to Postojna and had lunch in the car park before walking up to join the start of the tour. Roz and I had thought that we had visited these caves on a previous visit to Slovenia 17 years ago but in retrospect, we think we may have seen a different cave system nearby. The ones we saw then were very impressive and we were keen to go again. We were still not 100% sure when we left these if they were the same ones or not (probably not) but either way, this was another very spectacular sight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The tour started with a 2km journey through the caves on a small train. It was a bit like riding on a fairground ghost train but through a series of narrow caves with plenty of illuminated stalagmites and stalactites along the way. This journey alone would have been worth visiting the caves for.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We then had a 1.5km guided walk through tunnels, halls, galleries and caverns decorated with lots more stalagmites and stalactites. The hour and a half tour ended in the vast "Concert Hall" cave before we all got on the train back to the exit.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had about another hours drive from Postojna to get to Lake Bled where we have a house booked for the next three nights. There was no-one there to meet us when we arrived but we had been told where the key was and were able to let ourselves in. The house is a bit isolated but is up on a hill and has a large balcony with superb views of the lake and Bled Castle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks on the balcony as the sun was setting before walking into the town of Bled itself. This is about two miles away although we walked the slightly longer route round the lake with plenty of photo stops along the way. We got into Bled and went straight to Gostilna Pri Planincu, the pub/restaurant we had spent a lot of time in when we were here 17 years ago. The pub had not changed much but it now had a separate pizza restaurant upstairs. We ate in the pizza restaurant before having a drink downstairs and getting a €20 taxi home.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 19th September</span>
            I was awake by 6:20 so was able to watch the sunrise from the balcony. After everyone else had woken and we had eaten breakfast, Roz and I went out on our bikes for a few hours. Although there are not many cycle paths in the area, it is another place that is very good for cycling. We found a cycle route on the internet that did not seem too challenging and set off just before 11:00.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">This was an excellent bike ride. Although the area is quite mountainous, at the start of the Julian Alps, the route was not too hilly. There was the odd steep climb, particularly going up to Radovljica but the views along the way made the effort worth while. We cut the ride slightly shorter than planned by coming off the route and not being able to get back on it. There are several roads in this area that do not allow cyclists and it is not obvious from the map which roads these are. Our planned detour to get back on route was knocked on the head by one such road so we gave up and returned to Bled. We met Aleks and Andi in Bled and bought lunch from the supermarket before returning to the house to eat on the balcony.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, I went out on my bike again and did another 10 miles on the bike, mainly around the lake, bringing my total for the day to just over 30. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few glasses of wine on the balcony again in the evening (red from Bulgaria and white from Croatia). We were going to walk down to the camp site at the bottom of the hill which has a restaurant but just before we were about to go, we had a thunderstorm and quite a bit of rain. We carried on drinking hoping it would stop but it kept going. We still had quite a bit of food leftover from previous meals so eventually decided to stay where we were and eat that instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 20th September</span>
            53 miles on my bike today. I went out on my own a bit earlier than yesterday without any real idea of where I was going. I started doing the same route as yesterday but after about 9 miles, I saw a sign to Jesenice so decided to go that way. I got to Jesenice after about 19 miles.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-109.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">There was not much to see there (in fact it is a particularly unappealing industrial town) but it is still in a spectacular setting with mountains on either side of a steep valley and it was an enjoyable ride. I think there was a shorter route back to Bled but I was happy to go back exactly the same way. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">I had arranged to meet all the others (who had been lying by the lake) at 2:00. I got back to Bled before 1:00 so cycled round the lake again before stopping for a beer at Gostilna Pri Planincu. I would have had another if the service had not been so poor, but left after one and met everyone else for lunch in a cafe just down the hill from there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After eating, Roz and I went out and did another 12 miles round the same area again i.e. between Bled and Radovljica which was about the nicest part of the area for cycling. We got back to the house just after 5:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">No-one wanted to walk anywhere to eat so we had another evening on the balcony (it was the best part of the accommodation!). Aleks and Andi had bought food on their way back from Bled so we ate that with the end of our wine. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st September</span>
            I was awake by 7:00 so, after watching the sunrise, went out on my bike for the last time here. I chose a "moderate" route from the same website that we had used a couple of days ago. This involved a very steep uphill start to the village of Pokljuka, a steep downhill to a river and then an eight mile ride up the valley next to the river. This was an excellent ride with stunning scenery the whole way. There was hardly any traffic so for most of the way, the only sounds were cow bells and the river. I did not realise just how much I climbed cycling along the valley to Radovna but the eight miles down the valley on the way back was superb. I got back to Lake Bled by about 9:40 so did a final lap of the lake before returning to the house. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Bled had been my favourite place for cycling on the whole trip. As with Istria, motorists are fairly considerate, the roads are fairly empty and the scenery has been amazing. Not sure how much more cycling I will do on this trip but this has certainly been a highlight.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-110.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After breakfast and a shower, we packed up the car and left the house at 11:00. We had a four hour drive from Bled to Mondsee, just East of Salzburg. The drive was easy enough again. We got straight through the Slovenia/Austria border with the minimum of interest from the border police. The motorway all the way was incredibly scenic as the route took us straight through the Slovenian and Austrian Alps. The four hours included a stop to buy food, a look at the castle that featured in "Where Eagles Dare" and "The Sound of Music" and a lunch stop in a not particularly scenic lay-by. We arrived in Mondsee just after 3:00 and easily found Pension Göschlberger just off the main road.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out at 4:00 and walked into the centre where the main site is a church that apparently also was featured in The Sound of Music. After a few minutes walking round that, we went to the Schlossbräu tavern which was a far better place to visit. We had a beer in there before walking down to the lake for a look around. We had another beer before returning to the hotel for showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked back to Schlossbräu to eat, stopping for a beer on the way. We had excellent meals and a few more beers before walking back to the hotel in the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 22nd September</span>
            We checked out of the hotel at 10:30 and drove Aleks and Andi to Salzburg Airport, about 20 miles away. They flew home from there, we continued our drive North. We had a drive of just over 300 miles today from the airport to Mannheim. The first part of the journey was pretty slow. There were long queues of traffic to cross the Austria/Germany border for some reason and a lot of traffic all the way up to the Munich ring road. We don't know if it is always like that at weekends or if the start of the Munich Oktoberfest had any impact but it looked as if it was going to be a long day in the car. (We had wanted to stop in Munich but the Oktoberfest meant that hotel prices were very high and we would rather be there when it was not taking place anyway. However, it was quite sad to be driving past without stopping.)
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT2018-111.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Things did get better after getting away from Munich. There was less traffic and faster motorways. We had one stop on the way and arrived in Mannheim at 17:00. We checked into the Mercure hotel and were in our room in time to follow the second half of this afternoon's football.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went out about an hour after the football had finished. We did not have much of a plan about where we were going. Mannheim does not have a great range of the sort of German bar/restaurants that we like but after walking through the town centre for a while we did find one place (Alter Simpl) which did traditional German food and served the local Eichbaum beer. We had a good table so ended up spending about four and a half hours in there while having another very good meal and plenty of the excellent wheat beer. I only vaguely remember stopping at the bar outside our hotel for a final drink before going back to the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 23rd September</span>
            Did not do a lot today. Caught up on sleep in the morning and did not leave the hotel. We had planned to cycle to Heidelberg, about 15 miles away, but there were warnings of gale force winds, thunderstorms, heavy rain and the possibility of a tornado in the area so we decided against it. We went out for a walk around the sights of Mannheim in the afternoon but were back in the hotel by the time the rain started at 5:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were both in need of a night without alcohol and neither of us were bothered about sitting in a restaurant so we went out and got a burger from McDonalds and were back in the hotel by 9:00. Spent an hour or so sorting out photos from the last few weeks and had an early night.
            </p>
