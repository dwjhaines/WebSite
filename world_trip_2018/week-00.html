                Left Maidstone at 7:20 and were in Dover just after 8. Did not have anything we
                needed to do so we went straight to Eastern Docks and checked in for the 10:00
                DFDS ferry to Dunkerque. The ferry was on time and by just after 1:00 we were in
                France.

                We were staying in Poperinge in Belgium but our first stop was at trappist
                brewery. The other Belgium trappist beers can be bought just about anywhere but
                Westvleteren is just about impossible to buy anywhere other than at the brewery
                where it is produced. We had hoped to buy some bottles from the shop but there
                was none for sale when we got there. However, we were able to drink the beer in
                the cafe so both tried the blond before continuing for another five miles into
                Poperinge. We found the hotel without too many problems and Roz went to check in
                while I got the bikes out of the car and put them both together. After we had
                put our luggage into the room, we headed off to cycle round a 20 mile route we
                had printed out before leaving home.</p>

                The route took us first to Watou, home of the St Bernardus brewery. This was
                completely closed (today is a public holiday in Belgium) but we stopped for a
                couple of local beers in the main square in the centre of Watou anyway. From
                here, we cycled back to Westvleteren where we could sample the stronger beers at
                the abbey cafe without having to worry about driving. I tried both the 8 and the
                12 together with the abbey pate (all very good!) before continuing our trip back
                to Poperinge. By the time we had showers it was getting on for 9pm. We went out
                for a few more beers in a couple of bars in the main square and managed to
                sample most of the St Bernardus range. I vaguely remember getting back to the
                hotel at around midnight.</p>

                Did not do much in the morning apart from eating breakfast in a park near where
                we had left the car. We headed out on our bikes again just after 1pm. We had
                visited the tourist information office in Poperinge which was particularly
                unhelpful. There is an excellent network of cycle paths in Belgium which has a
                series of numbered junctions. It is very easy to find your way around as long as
                you know which junction you need to get to next. Without a map, the numbers are
                no use at all and the tourist information was unable to provide us with one.</p>

            <p class="diary-text">We decided to cycle to Diksmuide, about 15 miles away. Due
                to a few road closures and the lack of maps, this ended up being about a 23 mile
                trip. It was a very nice town when we got there with a spectacular main square.
                The tourist information office here was also unable to provide us with a map but
                we could photograph the one outside and use that to get us back to Poperinge on
                a slightly more direct, and scenic route.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stopped for a beer at the St-Sixtus Abbey again on our
                way back and were back at the hotel in Poperinge by about 7pm. We were both
                pretty tired by now having cycled over 40 miles. We wandered round the town
                centre looking for somewhere for a drink (most of the town seemed to be closed)
                and ended up back at the second bar we had been drinking in last night.&nbsp; We
                had a few drinks in there and a meal before returning to the hotel for a
                relatively early night.</p>

                We were up and packed by 8ish and checked out of the hotel. Today was to be
                spent in the car driving down to Dinkelsbühl on the "Romantic Road" about 470
                miles away. Roz went to get food for the journey while I attached the bikes to
                the back of the car and we were on our way by about 8:30. The journey was fairly
                uneventful. We had a few stops on the way for meals and petrol and were in
                Dinkelsbühljust before 5:00. The weather was not great all the way down and got
                decidedly worse when we were about 20 miles away. However, it dried up
                completely by the time we arrived so we decided to continue with our plan to
                camp for a few days. We found our way to the same camp site that we had stayed
                at during the 2006 World Cup and pitched our tent in almost exactly the same
                spot overlooking the lake. It was the first time the tent has been used since we
                stayed here six years ago! The last time we were here, we had to share the area
                with two other tents. This time we had it completely to ourselves - everyone
                else on the camp site is in caravans further from the lake.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of beers in front of the tent before walking into the centre of
                Dinkelsbühl, about a mile away. We ate in the first place we came to in the old
                town - typically huge portions of food together with the locally brewed wheat
                beer. After eating, we walked around the town which was more spectacular than
                either of us had remembered from last time we were here. We had a couple more
                beers in the same place before returning to the camp site at about 11:30.</p>

    We were woken at 2ish by a thunder storm. Plenty of thunder and lightening but
    fortunately, not too much rain so we remained dry inside the tent. We were up by
    about 8 and, after breakfast, headed into the old town again with our bikes. I
    had to get my peddles replaced as one had fallen off in Belgium. This did not
    take too long to sort out and we then spent about half an hour walking round the
    town taking pictures of the buildings.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
    We wanted to cycle along the Romantic Road cycle path to Nordlingen and headed
    off at about 10:30. It was about 25 miles each way but once we started, found
    that a lot of the route was very hilly and most of it was off-road which our
    bikes are not really suitable for. We gave back after about 15 miles and headed
    back towards Dinkelsbühl. After about three miles of the return journey, my bike
    decided to prove how unsuitable it was by getting a puncture in the front tyre.
    There was no option but to keep going so I had to do the last 10 - 12 miles with
    a totally flat tyre which was not ideal. Got back to Dinkelsbühl by about 2:30
    and stopped for&nbsp; a kebab for lunch before returning to the camp site. We
    took the car out to stock up on food and beer and then spent the rest of the
    afternoon fixing my puncture and lazing around by the tent trying to decide what
    to do between now and Saturday when we meet up with everyone in Munich. Did not
    really make a definite decision but will probably drive to Augsburg tomorrow.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
    We had planned to have a few beers outside the tent this evening but it started
    to rain at about 7. We had to move inside the tent fairly quickly and sat in
    there with the beers instead. By 8:30ish the rain had eased sufficiently for us
    to walk into town where we went for a pizza and a couple more in the place we
    had eaten yesterday.</p>

<p class="diary-text">
    <span class="diary-date">Friday, 1st June</span>The weather was still pretty
    crap when we woke up. It had stopped raining by about 7:30 so we decided to pack
    up and leave after we had eaten breakfast. It took about an hour to pack
    everything including the bikes into the car. We checked out and headed into
    Dinkelsbühl as we wanted to use the internet to look at options for tonight. We
    used the computer in tourist information and first of all discovered that
    Brendan Rodgers is going to Liverpool. This added to the fact that Lampard is
    out of the England squad was not a good start to the day! We looked at a few
    options for hotels for tonight and booked a room at an Etap at Augsburg. We left
    Dinkelsbühl at 10:30 and continued along the Romantic Road stopping first in
    Nördlingen. This was another very nice old town. We walked around the centre and
    climbed up the tower for views of the whole town. From here we continued driving
    to Augsburg and checked into a room just after 1.
</p>
<p class="diary-text">
    Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. In the evening we went for a walk
    around some of Augsburg's nain sights (rathaus, cathedral, etc) and then got a
    pizza from the takeaway next to the hotel. Had an early night to prepare
    ourselves for the next few days.</p>

<p class="diary-text">
    <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 2nd June</span>I was awake at 6:30 so went
    for a 4.5 mile run round the same route we had walked last night. We had
    breakfast in the room and left by about 8:30. It was only an hours drive to
    Munich and we found the Ibis without any problems. We were able to get a room
    straight away and, after we had left our stuff in the room, we headed off to the
    Augustiner Keller where we had arranged to meet Hoggy, Gary and Ed who were the
    first to fly out.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
    It was only about a 25 minute walk from the hotel - less than we were expecting
    - and we were in the beer garden just before it opened at 11. Hoggy, Gary and Ed
    turned up just before midday and we stayed there until 3ish. We went back with
    them to check in to their hotel and then walked to the Hacker-Pschorr Brau Haus.
    By about 4:30, Gary was already asleep! We had a couple in there and walked to
    the Augustiner-Grossgastst<font face="Times New Roman">ä</font>ttewhere we were joined by Dave and Cathy and eventually Regan and Annette. Thisplace had gone downhill a bit since we were last here - it was full of stag andhen nights whereas it had always been a more traditional German restaurant inthe past. We had also gone a bit downhill by this time and after Gary had fallenasleep again and Regan had knocked his beer over, we decided it was time toleave. Me, Roz, Dave and Cathy got a tram to Karlsplatz and then walked to thewheat beer house. We had one in there before meeting everyone else in the "PigPub" over the road. Things are very vague in my memory from this point but aftera few in there, we went to the Hofbrauhaus except Ed, Gary and Cathy who wenthome. Vaguely remember being in the Hofbrauhaus but have no memory of thejourney back to the hotel.</p>

<p class="diary-text">
    <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 3rd June</span>
    Left the hotel at 11:30 with Regan and Annette and walked to the
    Augustiner-Grossgaststätte where we met up with everyone else. Had a couple in
    there, then went back to the Hacker-Pschorr Brau Haus and from there walked to
    the Paulaner Brau Haus - somewhere we had not been to before.</p>
<p class="diary-text">
    We got the U-Bahn back into the centre and had tea in the Nurnburger Sausage
    House (72 sausages!). Things started getting a bit messy after this. Roz and I
    walked to the Wheat Beer House with Regan, Annette and Cathy while the others
    had another beer in the tap room of the sausage house. We all met up again in
    the pig pub. I was too drunk to get into the Hofbrauhaus so got a train to the
    Haubtbahnhof and walked home from there. Gary woke up on a bench at an S-Bahn
    station at 3am with Steffan who he had met in the tap room!</p>
