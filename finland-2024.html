              Another trip where the start was affected by my hospital appointments. We had planned to drive up to Heathrow this morning, leave the car there and then go into central London for a few drinks before the England v Greece game at Wembley. However, Due to my 3:10 appointment with Rheumatology in Basingstoke, Roz had to take the car in on her own.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Roz left Kingsclere at 12:30, drove to Heathrow and left the car with Meet and Greet at Terminal 3 where we will flu back to on Tuesday. She then caught a bus to the Ibis and checked in for tonight. Steve then collected her and drove to Wembley. They were in the Wetherspoons by 4:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I got the 2pm bus from Kingsclere to the hospital. I was out by 3:30 and got straight on a bus to the station. As I was buying my ticket, I heard that the 15:57 train had been cancelled due to "congestion". The congestion also meant that a lot of trains were not stopping at Clapham Junction. I caught a slow train to Woking (stopping everywhere except Clapham) then a train to Clapham and another to Willesden Junction. From there I got the tube to Wembley Central and joined Roz in the pub by 6.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After the game, Steve gave us a lift back to the Ibis where we had our welcome drink before bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 11th October</span>
              We checked out of the Ibis at 8 and got the bus into Heathrow Central. We went straight through into Terminal 2, had breakfast and waited for our 10:10 Lot flight to Warsaw. The flight was about half an hour late leaving meaning that we had just one hour in Warsaw to get our connecting flight to Tallinn. However, this was also about half an hour late so we had time to get a beer and something to eat before boarding. We arrived in Tallinn at about 6:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were through the airport quickly and got straight in a taxi to the centre. We had booked to stay in Old City Apartments. Our apartment is very nice again. It is just off the main square and overlooks the apartment we stayed in last time we were in Tallinn.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went out for the evening at 7:30. The last times we were in Tallinn, we spent quite a lot of time at The Beer House. However, they have stopped doing pizzas and seem to be a lot more expensive than anywhere else so we gave it a miss. A branch of Mikkeller has opened since we were here last and it is right opposite the apartment. We were expecting that to be expensive as well but it wasn't and the beer was very good. We had a few in there before walking through the square and up to Hell Hunt.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              This place has not changed much since we were first there in 2007 and was still excellent. They still served Double Chocolate Stout and there own beer was also very good. We had food and about four rounds of beers before ending the night with a final beer back in Mikkelller. We were back in the apartment just before midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 12th October</span>
              I was up by about 8:30 and went out for a walk while Roz slept. I wandered round the old town for a bit and then found a supermarket to buy things for breakfast. We ate breakfast in the apartment and went out to start our sight-seeing at 11:40.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              There are not really any stand out "must-see" sights in Tallinn but it is a superb place just to wander round. The old town is full of lovely cobbled streets, with nice buildings to look at and plenty of towers and gates, etc. We started off in the main square and then walked through Katariina käik and out to Viru värav, the main medieval gate on that side of town. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
              border="0"

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We then went back across town to the area on the other side and up to the cathedral. Again, the cathedral was not too spectacular but the whole area was really good to walk around with lots of the old walls and towers. We bought ourselves another building for our collection - a replica of the pharmacy on the main square - and wandered back down to the apartment via more towers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had lunch at the kebab shop inside the Viru gate and returned to the apartment for the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went out for the evening just before 5. As usual, I had searched google for craft beer bars and there seemed to be quite a few outside the old town in the area by the station. We headed over there and visited four of them - Vaat Taproom, Purtse Tap Room, Põhja Konn and Pudel. It was a bit of a strange area and it was a bit like doing some of the pubs on the Bermandsey Beer Mile but they all had good beer and Põhja Konn in particular was a very nice bar.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              At 7:30, we walked back into the old town and back to Hell Hunt. We stayed in there for almost three hours and saw most of the Croatia v Scotland game with a few more beers. Neither of us can remember leaving the pub but it looks as if we had one more in Mikkeller before going back to the apartment. A very enjoyable night out!
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 13th October - Finland v England</span>
              We were up by 8:30 and left the apartment just before 9. We had a walk of about 30 minutes to get to the Tallink ferry port. After a bit of confusion we found the passenger terminal and went through to wait for the ferry to Helsinki. We boarded the ferry just before 10 and made our way to the restaurant for our buffet breakfast. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
              border="0"
              width=100%;
              src="images/finland2024/estonia2024_004.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The ferry was huge and we had seen it being described as being more like a cruise ship than a ferry. The buffet breakfast had looked good on the Tallink website and we had booked it before leaving home. This was a good move. We had a table right at the front of the boat and the food was all very good. It also included unlimited wine so we had a very enjoyable couple of hours!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We docked in Helsinki at 12:30 and got straight on a tram to go to the ticket collection point at the Hilton Hotel. We picked up our tickets and walked back to the Bob W Apartments where we are staying for the next two nights. We were too early to check in but we were able to leave our bags in the luggage room. We headed back out and went to collect our Free Lions from one of the squares. We then walked across town to Bierhaus München which had looked as if it was one of the better drinking options here. However it was closed when we got there so we found another bar for a drink while we waited to check in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We returned to Bob W at 3, got into our apartment, had showers and went straight back out again. We walked up to the Kallio area where we met up with Steve, Mick and Mark. The bar we were in was OK and we had a couple of drinks in there before it closed at 5. We started walking towards the ground which was only about a mile away. Roz and I stopped to see if we could find another pub as we were not keen on getting too close to the ground so early. We walked back to "Pub Pressari" which had the cheapest beer we have managed to find in Helsinki. Most places seem to be around €8 or €9 for 0.4l but here we were getting "pints" for under €6. We had a couple in there before making our way to the ground.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Getting into the ground was all quite straight-forward. We had quite a good view from our seats so did not bother trying to find the others. The game was not great again but at least we won this time. We were not held in the ground at the end and walked straight back to the pub we had been in before the game.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              It was quite full and we were with a group of Finnish fans and a group from London. There were plenty of rounds of nasty spirits bought and although we kept saying we would have just one more round, we ended up staying until it closed sometime after 1am. We had not eaten anything since breakfast so we stopped at a supermarket for food on the way back but do not remember this too clearly!             
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Monday 14th October</span>
              We were a bit later getting up this morning. Roz went out to buy bread for breakfast which we did not eat until about midday.
