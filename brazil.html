<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday 17th June</span> Left Kingsclere at 1ish and drove to Heathrow. We had a couple of pints before departing at 4:25 and were in Munich by 7:30 local time. We had a three hour wait at Munich airport, most of which we spent in AirBrau. The flight from Munich to Sao Paulo left on time at 10:30. There were not quite as many fans on the plane as when we flew to South Africa four years ago and those that were on the flight were mainly English. We had a few more drinks on the plane before falling asleep.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday 18th June</span> We landed in Sao Paulo at 5:30 am. We had no problems getting through customs but had a bit of a wait for our luggage. Our rucksacks together with a couple of other items were not on the carousel with everything else but appeared from somewhere on a trolley for some reason. Once that panic was over, we changed terminals to get money from an ATM and then got a taxi to our hotel. The 25km journey cost 124 Reai (about £35) and took about 75 minutes due to the already heavy traffic.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IPL-oxsBLhg/U6K_HUgheJI/AAAAAAAAPqA/Rn8ARHGsnFU/s400/Brazil_012.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We were able 
to check in but could not have our room for another couple of hours.&nbsp; We
 walked out to the ticket collection point. We were not expecting it to 
be open but when we got there we went straight in and picked up our 
tickets within about 5 minutes. We spent the next hour or so walking around the area near our hotel before 
returning to the collection point where we had arranged to meet Steve at
 10:00. There was no sign of him by 10:15 so we walked back to the hotel
 where we were able to get our room. The area we are staying in is nice 
enough without being too exciting. It certainly seems safe enough for 
walking around but there is not a huge amount of evidence that the World
 Cup is taking place here.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We had messages from Steve by e-mail by 
the time we were in the room so after sleeping for about half an hour, 
we headed out to meet him, Mark and Dave. There was some confusion over 
the bar we were meeting in. We gave up looking after about 20 minutes 
and found somewhere to eat while watching Holland v Australia, the 1:00 
game. They eventually found us as we were leaving and we moved to 
another bar for the second half.&nbsp; We then tried to find somewhere with 
better bars but ended up doing a lot of walking&nbsp; before resorting to an 
Irish&nbsp; bar. This was pretty crap but we saw the second half of Spain v 
Chile before getting taxis back to our hotel. There are more bars and 
restaurants in this area than anywhere else we have been and we found 
somewhere to eat a few minutes walk away. We saw the third game of the 
day, Croatia v Cameroon before heading off for an early night - everyone
 was totally knackered by this time.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday 19th June Uruguay v England</span> Woke up feeling a lot better than yesterday after a good night's sleep. We had breakfast at the hotel and headed out for the day at about 10:30. We went to the Oi shop to get our Brazilian SIM's sorted out and then returned to the restaurant that we had lunch in yesterday. We were joined by Steve, Mark and Dave and had a couple of beers in there before departing for the game at 1:30.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FvBerXqry-k/U6QhHXQ_xSI/AAAAAAAAPrs/6BNDG7MgIWg/s400/Brazil_037.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We used the metro to get to the ground. This involved a metro train to Luz and then the "express" train directly to Corinthians. It took about 30 mins from leaving the station to getting into the ground after all the usual FIFA ticket checks, etc. We were in the ground just after 3:00 with the kick-off at 4:00. Roz and I were about four rows form the front behind the goal while the others were much higher up in the temporary stand. We had a pretty good view and from where we were the ground and atmosphere were quite impressive.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">No need to say too much about the game itself. England are still in the World Cup but could be out tomorrow if Italy fail to win. </p>
<p  class="diary-text">After the game we got the train back into Luz. Everything was surprisingly well organised with plenty of trains so it did not take us long to get back. We got another metro out to a pub where we had arranged to meet the others (Cervejaria Nacional). Mark and Dave turned up about 10 minutes after us and Steve got there about two hours later with the other three who are staying with them and Barbara who had helped them find the pub. It was slightly more expensive than our local bars but had an excellent range of beers and very good food. The others left after eating but the five of us stayed in there until it closed at about 12:30 before getting a taxi back. A very enjoyable evening despite the result.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 20th June</span> Did not do a lot in the morning. We did go out to the bank and the Oi shop again but spent most of the time in the room. We had arranged a late check out as we are on an overnight bus tonight that does not leave until 10:20.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">At 1:00 we went to watch the Italy v Costa Rica game in a TV room in the hotel. We needed Italy to win for England to stay in the competition. Italy lost. England are out. It was a strange way of watching England go out of a tournament and no less depressing.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8dwjSDz4Hfo/U6WxaqVuvsI/AAAAAAAAPvU/KBvsIwoTM24/s400/Brazil_090.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">After the game,we checked out of the hotel and got the metro out to the fan fest. We normally try and avoid these but we had not found the FIFA shop yet and assumed that there would be one there.The whole area was pretty rough and the fanfest itself was particularly scummy. They are never the best of things but this one was very poor. There was no shop there and there seemed to be as many police there as football fans. It did nothing to cheer us up and we got the metro back to the hotel after about 10 minutes. We watched the end of the second game in the hotel and then went out to eat at the same place we ate two nights ago.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">At 7:00 we got a taxi out to the bus station. We were able to pick up the tickets that we had booked on-line with no problems. We had a couple of hours waiting around for the bus and eventually boarded just after 10:00. The bus was superb with large comfortable seats that reclined to almost horizontal with more than enough leg room. We were asleep within about 10 minutes of the bus pulling out at 10:10.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday 21st June</span> Woke up just before the bus got into Belo Horizonte at 6:00 after an almost uninterrupted seven and a half hours sleep. The bus station was full of Argentinians as they play Iran here today. We also found one Iranian so Lee got a country that we were not expecting!</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8P2MhUP1jrM/U6Wxdz23hgI/AAAAAAAAPvw/uFGfpndjmbI/s400/Brazil_093.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We bought tickets for the 7:00 bus to Ouro Preto where we are booked to stay for the next three nights. This was a two hour journey and the bus dropped us on the main road near our hotel at around 9:00.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We walked up to the hotel and were told we could not have our room yet as it had not been cleaned. We were able to put our luggage in the room and headed straight out to get the scenic train to Mariana, one of the highlights of staying in this area. We were given a lift to the station by someone at the hotel but after queuing to buy tickets, we were told that the 10:00 train was full and the next one was at 13:00. This was not ideal so we bought tickets for the 10:00 train tomorrow and headed back up the hill to look around the town.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">Ouro Preto is a really nice old town with lots of historic buildings on steep hills to wander round. We walked up to the main square then spent some time walking round the souvenir shops. All quite touristy but mainly Brazilian tourists - not too much evidence of the World Cup to be seen. We walked the mile or so back to our hotel stopping to buy food and drink along the way. We were able to get into our room/apartment when we got back and had lunch before going to sleep for an hour or so.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WKJDi4xQImU/U6cgKi3JX2I/AAAAAAAAQFE/uAYnrSS-QcM/s400/Brazil_121.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We had a couple of drinks in the&nbsp; room while watching the first half of the Germany v Ghana game and then watched the second half in a small bar on the way back into town. We had pizzas in a restaurant on the main square and then spent a couple of hours in a bar just off the main square that had a range of decent beers. Got a taxi back at about 10ish.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">During the day we decided to change our plans slightly and will travel to Belo Horizonte on Monday instead of Tuesday. The football kicks off at 1:00 on Tuesday so getting there would involve an early start from here if we stayed until Tuesday. Also although Ouro Preto is very nice, we have seen the sights and there is not too much else to do here. It is also cold here!</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday 22nd June</span> After another very good breakfast that had been served in our room, we walked back to the train station via the town centre. Not being able to get on the train yesterday worked out very well. There were a lot less people around so the train was half empty and the sun was out for the first time since Wednesday so it was much more enjoyable than if we had done the trip yesterday. </p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZtceHNp5lF8/U6gbWm4ZjEI/AAAAAAAAQMI/qrAKIj57va4/s400/Brazil_231.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">The highlight of the trip was the train itself. The steam engine was undergoing maintenance so we had a diesel engine instead but the rest of the train, built in the 1940's, has been completely restored and is in its original condition. The one hour journey to Mariana was quite scenic without being too spectacular and was all quite enjoyable. We had a quick wander round Mariana before getting the bus back down to Ouro Preto.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We were dropped in the centre so bought a couple of souvenirs before buying lunch and walking back to our hotel. We had a similar evening to yesterday with slightly more to drink. We stopped at the same bar on the way into town for a couple of beers and then watched the USA v Portugal game in another bar. There were a lot more England fans about tonight. We had a few beers while watching that game and then went for another pizza. We went to a nicer place than where we ate yesterday with better pizzas. We had a bottle of wine with the meal and got a taxi back to the hotel again. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 23rd June</span> We had breakfast in the room again and checked out at about 9:30. We had planned to walk up to the main road and wait for the 10:00 Belo Horizonte bus but the owner did not think this was a good idea so she gave us a lift to a bus stop. The bus appeared just after 10:00 and was fairly full due to the number of England fans on it. We arrived in the centre of BH at midday and got a taxi to our apartment. </p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QavpBo70b40/U6lPhvLukOI/AAAAAAAAQNo/Etzc43bwZtc/s400/Brazil_249.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">The apartment was excellent again with plenty of space and a small kitchen. We walked out to a supermarket and bought food for lunch. Did not do much for the rest of the afternoon. Mark, Steve and Dave arrived on a flight from Rio at about 1:00. They are staying about a mile from us and we arranged to meet somewhere in Savassi to watch the Brazil v Cameroon game. We headed out to Savassi at about 3:30 and found them in a bar about 20 mins later. Savassi is full of bars and was the area where most Brazil fans were congregating to watch the game. We ended up watching the game outside a restaurant in an area totally packed with people. It did not seem an ideal place to be initially but the beer was cheap and once we had all got seats, it was quite an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We got out of Savassi as soon as the game had finished and headed back to the area near where we are staying. There are more bars here and we had a couple more drinks before going to a pizza restaurant to eat for the third night in a row. Mark, Steve and Dave got a taxi back to their hotel at about 10:30 and we walked round the corner to ours. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday 24th June Costa Rica v England</span> We left the hotel just before 9:00 and walked into the centre of town to one of the places where the shuttle buses go out to the ground. We had heard reports that it was very slow getting to the ground so we had decided to go early and try and find a bar when we got there. We had arranged to meet the others at 9:30. They had not arrived by 9:40 so we got on a bus and went without them. The journey took about 40 minutes and we were dropped about 30 mins walk from the ground. The others arrived 10 minutes after us and we all headed off in the direction of the ground. We managed to find a small bar on the way with a few seats and cheap cans of beer which was ideal for an hour or so. We left there at midday and continued walking to the ground.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OcL6EDvZO_s/U6q0nLv5ENI/AAAAAAAAQSI/Ub6840UDxC8/s400/Brazil_304.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">It took about half an hour to get into the ground having gone through all the security checks, etc. Quite a good atmosphere in the ground considering that there was nothing to play for and the game was pretty crap, but it was all quite sad knowing from the start that this was the last game of the World Cup for us.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">Roz and I got out of the ground fairly quickly after the game, walked back to the shuttle buses and got straight on a bus to Savassi. We walked to Grandpa's Attic, a pub where we had arranged to meet the others. They turned up about 25 minutes after us and we watched the Greece v Ivory Coast game in there with food and a few beers. We left there after the game had finished and walked round the corner to Krug, another brew-pub type place. Dave and Steve left at about 9:00 but me, Roz and Mark stayed until it was closing at about midnight before getting a taxi home. A good day despite the football. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday 25th June</span> Did not have too much to do today. We stayed around the hotel most of the morning, either in the room or by the pool. We had lunch in the room and apart from trips to the bank and the supermarket,&nbsp; did not go out until just before the 5:00 games. We watched the first half of France v Ecuador in a bar in Savassi and went back to Krug for the second half. We watched both games on the two big screens with the first Swiss fan we have seen so far. We had a few beers in there before heading back to the area near our hotel. We ended up back in the pizza place we ate at a couple of nights ago and were back in the hotel for a relatively early night.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday 26th June</span> We checked out of our hotel at about 8:30 and got a taxi out to the airport about 45 km out of town. We checked in without problems and had a couple of hours wait for our GOL flight to Rio at 11:30. There was some confusion about gates and we took off slightly late but we landed in Rio by about 1:00. We tried to book tickets for going up to the statue of Christ for Saturday morning but trains were full at this time so we gave&nbsp; up and got a taxi to Leblon where we have an apartment booked for the next three nights.</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u8C78dnIZX0/U6zFQEDgeDI/AAAAAAAAQeY/KtqnXNmv8-g/s400/Brazil_397.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">Once again, we have been lucky with our accomadation and have a very nice apartment in what seems a pretty good area. We had been thinking about staying here an additional night but once we saw the apartment, we both decided we would stay an extra two nights, miss out Parity and travel directly from here back to Sao Paulo&nbsp; before flying home on Tuesday.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We also decided to head out straight away and go up Sugar Loaf Mountain as it was quite a clear day. We left the apartment and after a short walk along the beach, got a taxi to where we get the cable car up the mountain. We queued in total for 30 - 45 minutes before getting into the first cable car which was not too bad considering the number of people around.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">The trip to the top involved two cable car journeys both of which were excellent. We were the first ones into the car for both journeys so had the perfect views looking down on Rio. The views from the half way point were excellent and got better as we got to the top. We were at the top just as the sun was setting over Rio with the statue of Christ in the background. An excellent start to our stay here.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">By the time we were back at the base, it was dark, We had a bit of a walk before getting a taxi and were back in Leblon by about 7:00. We went to a supermarket to stock on things for the next few days before returning to the apartment. We were unsure where the others were and could not really be bothered to go out looking so we ate locally and had another relatively early night.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 27th June</span> Today was Mark's 50th birthday and him, Dave, Roz and I had booked to go hang-gliding from São Conrado along the coast West of where we are staying. Mark and Dave got a taxi to our hotel and we were all picked up at about 7:30. The pick up took us round Rio for about an hour to a place in totally the opposite direction to where we were expecting to go. We were told that the conditions were not right for São Conrado and we would be doing the hang-gliding from somewhere near Niteroi on the other side of the harbour. We were all a bit sceptical about this but agreed to be driven up to the launch site to look at the view. Once up there, the views were spectacular. However, we saw someone else going off from there and the flight took less than three minutes as opposed to the advertised seven to ten minutes from São Conrado. After a lot of discussion, we gave up on the idea and asked to be taken back down. We were dropped at a ferry pier and got a boat back across the bay.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img alt="FIFA Official Fan Store" class="diary-photo" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JonBhHf0wxs/U62yyGMvNOI/AAAAAAAAQk8/Ua4tztJvLII/s400/Brazil_436.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">The ferry dropped us near the airport where we arrived yesterday. We got a bus back to Copacabana and spent an hour or so walking along the beach. There was no football today for the first time on two weeks so things were a bit quieter than they had been. We were able to get into the main FIFA shop which was particularly poor unless you were keen on buying armadillos! We walked along the beach towards Ipanema. Mark and Dave got a taxi home from Copacabana. Roz and I continued past the TV studios and round the corner to Ipanema before getting a taxi back from there. We had lunch in the apartment and then spent an hour or so sat in the sun.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We got a taxi out to Gãvea where the others are staying at about 5. We walked from there with Dave and Mark to a local bar with a good range of beers and were joined during the evening by Steve and a couple who support Palace. We headed into the centre of Gãvea at 9ish and got a table in a restaurant that the others had eaten in previously.&nbsp; We had excellent meals and a few more drinks and got a taxi back home sometime after midnight. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday 28th June</span> Today was the start of the 2nd Round with Brazil v Chile at 1pm. Mark and Dave got a taxi round to our place at 10:30 and the four of us got another taxi to the Lapa area where we planned to watch the game. Steve, Jer, etc had decided to watch the game at Copacabana an option that did not particularly appeal to us.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OzoXolrCrFI/U6_7UEh4DZI/AAAAAAAAQs4/uu7Iz5D3cDE/s400/Brazil_500.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We were in Lapa just before 11 and the place was already beginning to fill up. After a quick look at the aquaduct, we found a bar that was not charging to get in and got ourselves a table ready for the match. It turned out to be an excellent place to watch the game with enough people to create a good atmosphere but not so many that the place was completely packed. The game could not have been much better with the excitement of the penalties and Brazil eventually going through.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">By the time we left there it was about 4:00. We wandered round the sights of Lapa for a bit taking photos before going to another bar for the second game. This was a bit of an anti-climax after the first game and we left the bar 10 minutes before the end and got the metro back to Ipanema. We were trying to find a brew pub in Ipanema but it had moved from its location in Lonely Planet and we eventually gave up. We got a taxi to Leblon and went for a few more drinks in the same bar we had eaten in two nights ago. Got back to the apartment at 11ish. <br>
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday June 29th</span> Did not do a lot all morning apart from booking bus tickets to Sao Paulo for Tuesday. At midday, we walked into Copacabana. It took just over an hour by the time we found The Deck where we had arranged to meet the others. Mark, Steve and Dave were already there when we arrived and we also met up with Steve and Fred again who we know from previous tournaments.</p>

<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kpwOlSc5tUg/U7FkfYP5iRI/AAAAAAAAQ5o/AW_CclsMtS0/s400/Brazil_658.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We stayed in the bar until the end of the Holland v Mexico game and then Mark, Dave, Roz and I got a taxi to the station for the Corcovado train that goes up the hill to the Statue of Christ. We had booked tickets for the 4:00 train. The journey up the steep hill took about 20 minutes. There was not too much to see on the way up with only brief glimpses of the views to come. Once at the top, the views were incredible. The statue itself is fairly spectacular but the 360 degree views over the whole of Rio were superb. It was a clear day and we could make out all the places we have been to in the last few days Sugar Loaf, Copacabana, Ipanena, Lapa, etc and we also had views of the Maracana. There were a lot of people up there but there was enough space and it seemed a lot better than when Steve had been up there 48 hours previously. We spent an hour or so at the top getting plenty of photos of us all with arms out, etc. Definitely one of the highlights of the whole trip!
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We got the train back down by about 6:30 and got a taxi back to Copacabana where we caught the end of the Greece v Costa Rica game in another branch of the brewpub that we had been looking for last night. The beer here was excellent and made a very nice change from the local lager that is sold everywhere here. We spent a few hours in there as the food was also very good before walking a bit further along to where Steve, Jer, etc had all spent most of the evening. Roz and I stayed for a couple of drinks before getting a taxi back to the apartment.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 30th June</span> We had rearranged the hang-gliding for this morning and were supposed to be picked up at 9:00. However, at about 8:30, (five minutes after I had taken out the money to pay for it) we had an e-mail from Conrad saying that the conditions were bad and we would not be picked up until 12:00. Mark and Dave decided they would go anyway, Roz and I decided to drop out again. Instead, we had a similar day to yesterday. Did not do much in the morning and then waked into Copacabana by about 1:30. We had planned to watch the France v Nigeria game there but we instead got a taxi back to Leblon and watched the second half in Casa Clipper, the place we have eaten at a couple of times.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">After the game, we went back to the apartment for an hour or so before returning to Copacabana to meet Mark and Dave again in Debassa. They had both enjoyed&nbsp; hang-gliding and it did sound as if it would have been a good thing to do. We stayed in Debassa for the Germany v Algeria game. During the game, Dave had his bag stolen from under the table. This was the third thing to have been stolen in just over 24 hours - Mark had had his camera taken from his bag yesterday and Bob, who is staying in the same place as them had had a gold chain snatched from him at Ipanema earlier today. Dave did not lose his wallet but did lose his camera and the DVD and t-shirt from his hang-gliding. This did all put a bit of a dampener on the rest of the night but we were joined by Steve and Ger and still managed to get through 48 beers between us so not too bad a night.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We got taxis back at 11ish and Roz and I returned to the apartment to finish the Bacardi we had bought earlier in the week.</p>

<p  class="diary-text"><b>Tuesday 1st July</b> Did not do much all morning but I did manage to change our leftover money into pounds without losing too much on the deal. We checked out of the apartment at 11:15 and got a taxi out to the bus station. This was the start of what was to be an approximately 33 hour journey home.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">We picked up our tickets at the bus station and just after 1:00 we were on the bus back to Sao Paulo.&nbsp; The bus was not quite as luxurious as the one we left Sao Paulo on but was close enough and it was a fairly comfortable six hour journey. We had expected to be dropped at the airport in Sao Paulo but were instead dropped at a bus terminal a mile or so away. We were put on a bus to another terminal where we changed to an airport bus that did eventually drop us at Terminal 3. We checked in and cleared immigration with no problems and had time for something to eat before boarding the 22:30 United Airlines light to Washington. The flight left roughly on time and we were both asleep soon after the meal had been served.</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday 2nd July</span> We landed in Washington about an hour late at 7:10 local time. The queues through immigration were predictably slow but we got through and had re-checked our luggage by 8:00. The breakfast on the plane had not been great so we had sandwiches before boarding our connecting flight back to Heathrow at 9:30. The flight back was uneventful and we landed in Heathrow roughly on time at 22:00. Had to wait around for luggage and the bus to the car-park and got back to Kingsclere at 23:50.<br>
