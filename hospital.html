                <p class="from-me">I'm checked in and waiting to move somewhere else. The only reason that I am in emergency is that there are no beds available where I should be going. I think this could take a while</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK… am I allowed to come in?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Where should you be going?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Not sure</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Ok will walk down and see.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I am in the emergency department waiting area</p>
                <p class="from-me">Moved to New department. Waiting for blood/COVID tests before I can do anything. I really think you may as well go home. This is all going to take ages</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK. Will wait here for a while and see if you come back. Are they thinking of admitting you?</p>
                <p class="from-me">I asked that and he said something like probably not but may be</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK. Do you know what scans they are going to do?</p>
                <p class="from-me">No</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I am in Costa at the main entrance. Will stay here whilst having my coffee in case I can see you.</p>
                <p class="from-me">It's going to take ages. Just had blood tests and a few other tests</p>
                <p class="from-roz">What are they testing for?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just standard things ECG COVID and lots of blood</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK.  Keep me updated. Xx</p>
                <p class="from-me">Still say in the same room. It sounds as if everyone has gone home!</p>
                <p class="from-me">Sat</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oh dear. Have you had your Covid result?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Are you on your own in that room?</p>
                <p class="from-me">No the nurse just did all the tests and left. Yes I am on my own</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oh dear… on Friday afternoon… doesn’t bode well, does it?</p>
                <p class="from-me">As I said, you may as well go home</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Yep, I will do soon</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Are you still there on your own?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Any updates? I am home. X</p>
                <p class="from-me">I am in the acute assessment unit. It's horrible. Someone will see me shortly</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Why is it horrible? Lots of people?</p>
                <p class="from-me">It's a hospital ward with lots of such people. They still don't know if I will be in overnight or not. If I do, you are not able to visit but you can bring me things and give them to reception. My phone is down to 37%.i may need a charger</p>
                <p class="from-me">Sick</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Ok … can I call you?</p>
                <p class="from-me">OK</p>
                <p class="from-me">You would need to bring my tablets as well although doctor I just spoke to said they may be giving me different antibiotics</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Yes I know to bring them</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just been told that I am staying in overnight</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK and are they doing anything more tonight?<BR>I assume you will be moved to a ward when they have a space for you.<BR>Where do I bring stuff to?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">And when?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">USA in our group</p>
                <p class="from-me">Acute assessment unit AAU. It's F4 <BR>Still not sure if I will see doctor tonight. I don't really see the need to stay in. I could just come back tomorrow but I guess it doesn't work like that</p>
                <p class="from-me">When you do come in, send me a message just before you get to reception. As long as I am not with a doctor, I will go to the toilet and should be able to see you</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK. I will watch the draw and then come back.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Iran in our group as well</p>
                <p class="from-me">Could you bring a book as well. I think the Springsteen book is somewhere in the lounge. If not, any Morse book</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Scotland, Wales Ukraine in our group…</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Leaving home now. Have your charger, plug, antibiotics, a clean t-shirt, book…. anything else?</p>
                <p class="from-me">No that's fine</p>
                <img class="from-me" src="images/wa/IMG-20220401-WA0002.jpg"></img>
                <p class="from-me">Tea</p>
                <img class="from-me" src="images/wa/IMG-20220401-WA0003.jpg"></img>
                <p class="from-me">The rest of it doesn't look too bad</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Indeed. I have just parked up. Will wait till it stops raining and then walk in. Will message you once I get close to this reception I have to find.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">In lift to F4</p>
                <p class="from-me">Let me know when you almost there</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Now</p>
                <p class="from-me">They seem quite concerned that the infection is still there. I've been told to stop taking my tablets and they are pumping antibiotics into me through those tubes in my arm.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Roz Haines: OK…, well, that’s not a bad thing if it brings the infection down.<BR>I suppose the issue is what is causing the infection. Any mention of the irregularities on the X-ray? <BR>I am home.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">What are you doing about your Mum?</p>
                <p class="from-me">No mention of anything else yet. Thanks for bringing that in. I think it would be a good idea to go out tonight. I'm sure it won't take your mind off it but better than just sitting worrying about it in the house. Bertie wants to know why he had been bought into hospital on foolish day?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Don't know. Can you phone her and tell her or would you rather I did it?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Or just leave it until tomorrow when we know more</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I am going to stay in and watch Dirty Dancing. Just spoken to Louise. I can’t face talking to people in the pub tonight.<BR>There is always tomorrow.<BR>Re your Mum - I am happy to call her, but would you rather wait until we know a bit more.<BR>I think waiting until tomorrow is better</p>
                <p class="from-me">OK</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Seb wanted to come to snuggle you, but Lee said it would be better if it was Bertie….</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Is your phone charging now?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Yes</p>
                <p class="from-me">Tea was unbelievable. Two scoops of mash potato in a load of gravy. The cheese sandwich was ok and it included ice cream and jelly so not all bad</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Well you say everything tastes odd… so really it doesn’t matter. X</p>
                <p class="from-me">Indeed!</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Just realised there is a message on the answering machine from your Mum asking for an update.<BR>Shall I call her?</p>
                <p class="from-me">If you don't mind</p>
                <p class="from-me">I know it won't be an easy conversation</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Righty ho - will do now. It’s fine.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Hi. Your Mum is ok with it… quite relieved as she thought it needs to be investigated.<BR>She is now phoning your sister.</p>
                <p class="from-me">The beds are ever so good here<BR>Lots of buttons to make you go up or down<BR><BR>May still have my scan tonight apparently</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Taramasalata, French bread, glass of wine and Dirty Dancing….</p>
                <img class="from-roz" src="images/wa/IMG-20220401-WA0004.jpg"></img>
                <p class="from-me">Enjoy yourself. Bertie wants a bed with up and down buttons</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Your sister called and sent her best wishes.</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just had a WhatsApp message from her</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Good</p>

                <p class="from-roz">It was easier for me when my second guess was Mount.<BR>Still being given antibiotics?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Only had one lot. Also had injection in stomach to thin the blood in case it is a blood clot</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Errrr</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oops…. that was meant to be “ugh”…. wouldn’t like that…</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Sid is desperate to be on my lap…. who would have thought it!</p>
                <p class="from-me">Hopefully he will stay on your lap and ignore me</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Are they still talking about the scan tonight?</p>

                <p class="from-me">Bertie says night night</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Night night....</p>
                <p class="from-date">2nd April 2022</p>
                <p class="from-me">Dave: Good morning! An interesting night!<BR><BR>10pm: they seem to think that one of my blood tests indicates a high chance of a blood clot. Nothing happening so they obviously don't think it is that serious. With blood clots it's dangerous to move around so not allowed out of bed. Deep joy!<BR><BR>10:30: get told I am about to be moved to another ward.<BR><BR>11:30. Second lot of antibiotics pumped into me</p>
                <p class="from-me">12:00 all lights go out<BR><BR>12:40 finally start to fall asleep<BR><BR>12;45 porter appears with torch to take me to general ward. Everyone else in the ward seems to be on their 80's. All good fun<BR><BR>02:00: blood pressure tested for about eighth time since I have been here<BR><BR>03:00 had to call the nurse as the old bloke opposite me was trying to wander off somewhere but is not really capable of standing. She thanked me and put him back to bed</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Hello. Good lord.<BR>So do you have any idea which ward you are on?<BR>Blood clot… on the lungs?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Overall it's pretty grim in here. One old bloke has been talking to himself since I got in here. However I am staying strong and am able to cope. I think I will be in for a few days while they pump drugs into me</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I am so sorry.<BR>Coughing a lot?</p>
                <p class="from-me">The ward is a general ward. Blood clot cleared by drugs. Like I say no one seems to concerned about it.</p>
                <p class="from-me">I really am fine. I don't think it's going to be the best few days of my life but I will get through it. Don't think I am coughing as much. In fact definitely not</p>
                <p class="from-me">You should be asleep</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Someone woke me up with messages!</p>
                <p class="from-me">Bertie is missing the other cuddles and I'm missing you. I'll let you get back to sleep. Love Dave</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I love you too….</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Good Morning again.</p>
                <p class="from-me">Good Morning again.</p>
                <p class="from-me">Feeling fine. I have a feeling that I am going to be feeling fine for a few days while they pump drugs into me. Boredom is going to be the big problem as I feel fine but can't get out of bed</p>
                <img class="from-me" src="images/wa/IMG-20220402-WA0000.jpg"></img>
                <p class="from-me">Bertie says can you show Paddy what he's having for lunch</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Paddy says can he come… and why haven’t you ticked syrup sponge…</p>
                <p class="from-me">Only allowed two</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I have spoken to your Mum… she sends her love. Perhaps give her a ring when you get the chance?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Thanks. Breakfast not too bad. Lots of bits so kept occupied for a while.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Let me know if you want me to bring in more stuff…</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Have you done wordle</p>
                <p class="from-me">Yes have you</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Wordle 287 3/6*<BR><BR>⬜⬜🟨⬜🟨<BR>🟩🟨🟨⬜⬜<BR>🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩</p>
                <p class="from-me">Wordle 287 4/6*<BR><BR>🟨⬜🟨🟨⬜<BR>🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜<BR>🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩<BR>🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Second word was tepid</p>
                <p class="from-me">Did well to get it from that</p>
                <p class="from-me">Jane's monocular should arrive today I think</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Not really… took ages as no words fit.. I knew it started with T, and the p and e were the last two letter in either order. Almost certainly R as the second letter. I could not think of any words, so was making words up!!</p>
                <p class="from-me">Since I got the nurse to open the window, two of the over eighties have complained about being cold!</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oh dear…<BR>That quote looks good</p>
                <p class="from-me">They can give them extra blankets. What's the problem?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">How are you doing? I am going to leave at about 11:30 to go swimming<BR>Any updates? anymore drugs? Xx</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just had to have my sheets changed due to somehow spilling my p bottle all over myself</p>
                <p class="from-me">No updates - don't think there will be until Monday</p>
                <p class="from-me">No more drugs yet</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oh dear… I suppose they are used to it.</p>
                <p class="from-me">Indeed!</p>
                <p class="from-roz">That’s a shame…</p>
                <p class="from-me">Had a wash as well which was good</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Are they still monitoring the blood clot then? Won’t you need more blood thinning drugs?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">👍👍</p>
                <p class="from-me">They are going to spend five days injecting that stuff into my stomach. I think that is the treatment</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Shall I give Louise an update - she has asked</p>
                <p class="from-roz">On messenger… or will you reply</p>
                <p class="from-me">Yes, use messenger</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Oh… I didn’t know there was a plan for the drugs for 5 days for blood thinning.., that’s good</p>
                <p class="from-roz">She asked on foreign adventures so I was asking if I reply or you</p>
                <p class="from-me">That's from the internet so could be bollocks</p>
                <p class="from-me">Hadn't seen Louise's message I will reply</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Pardon… foreign adventures is our group on messenger with Hamish and zLouise</p>
                <p class="from-me">I know</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Ok off swimming now.</p>
                <p class="from-me">Okay</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just spoken to a doctor and they seem to have gone off the idea of a blood clot. I have pneumonia in one of my lungs. They need to get rid of the chest infection and will do the scans on Monday</p>
                <p class="from-roz">OK. But what about the blood test which they thought showed a blood clot?<BR>Do you still plan to inject you with stuff in the stomach?</p>
                <p class="from-me">They still plan to keep going with that. I'm not sure why</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Probably for the best as they are unsure.<BR>How is the coughing?</p>
                <p class="from-me">It is less and is not painful</p>
                <p class="from-me">Everything seemed to be going very smoothly. I was a bit surprised with this news</p>
                <p class="from-roz">So am I. It also means we don’t know what the abnormalities on the X-ray are.<BR>However I can understand that the infection needs to clear to do the scan</p>
                <p class="from-me">Oh well. Nearly time for the football</p>
                <p class="from-roz">I am so sorry, Dave.<BR>Just getting dressed and then will drive home.<BR>Have you managed to get my kindle to work in the iPad?</p>

                <p class="from-roz">Less nervous now?????</p>
                <p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Lee is very happy….</p>
                <p class="from-me">So am I. Not too many other people in the ward seem very excited</p>
                <p class="from-roz">How many are there in the ward?<BR>Any under 80?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Is the window still open?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Window still open. 6 on the ward. At least 4 over 80</p>
                <p class="from-roz">4</p>
                <p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Are you allowed to walk around if you don’t have a blood clot?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Yes</p>
                <p class="from-roz">So no more blood thinning drugs?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Just my antibiotics three times a day</p>
                <p class="from-roz">All over for you…</p>
                <p class="from-me">Lee a bit happier than Andy?</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Yes… Andy is used to it, he says! Bertie pleased? Is it tea time, Paddy wants to know.</p>
                <p class="from-me">That is an incredible result. First time any team had done the double</p>
                <p class="from-me">Not yet Paddy</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Well, at least that is something nice for you this weekend.</p>

                <p class="from-roz">For a little while, but going to see Louise who is making spaghetti bolognaise…</p>

                <p class="from-me">Got there in the end</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Can I call you?</p>
                <p class="from-me">Yes</p>
                <p class="from-me">Ward D1</p>
                <p class="from-roz">👍</p>
                <p class="from-roz">From the formless line……<BR>Oh dear. That's a bit of a shock. Loads of chest infections going round at the mo (both my mother & the jiblets been on heavy duty antibiotics recently) but to have pneumonia and possible clot on top is really unlucky. Annette says that it's really difficult to pinpoint anything if there's any any fluid in the lung and any scans are inconclusive, so cross fingers that it's just a touch of pneumonia that's caused an infection.</p>
				<p class="from-me">He has sent me a message</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I was thinking after our call that perhaps the X-ray indicated a possible blood clot. The blood test result disproved that…<BR>That’s quite a positive thought from me…</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No one answering the phone in D1</p>
				<p class="from-me">They are giving out good at the moment but I think there are people at our near the desk</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Nope, no reply</p>
				<p class="from-me">Try again</p>
				<p class="from-me">There is no one there</p>
				<p class="from-me">Give me a minute</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Can you hear it ringing?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Call now</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Tried exactly when the message came through - perhaps the website number of 01256 313681 rings somewhere else???</p>
				<p class="from-me">It's not ringing here. She says you need to go through main switchboard and ask for D1 medical</p>
				<p class="from-me">She is sat waiting</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Do you know the extension- I am on hold for the operator</p>
				<p class="from-roz">You have the option to put the extension in</p>
				<p class="from-me">Call me instead</p>
				<p class="from-me">I will take the phone to her</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hello. Sarah reckons the X-ray was the alert to a blood clot. The blood test then confirmed it wasn’t.<BR>She said it happens quite often and that was the rush to hospital particularly as you had flown long haul. 
				She reckons it could well be fluid and phlegm on the X-ray.<BR>All a bit more positive. Xx</p>

				<p class="from-roz">I can bring plain ones. Where are they kept? The turtle and flamingo ones were in your office… I presume waiting to be put away</p>
				<p class="from-me">They are fine. I was joking. I am very content sat here in my flamingo shorts. I'm glad you put them in. I would not have thought of it.</p>

				<p class="from-me">I have just been for another chest x-ray</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Okxx</p>
				<p class="from-me">The chest x-ray woman said something like"I assume you have had a CT scan." I said I hadn't. She went to see the CT scan people and they said that something had been put on my notes saying that a CT scan was no longer needed.</p>
				<p class="from-me">The CT scan woman did not seem 100% sure about this but went back, spent about 10 minutes talking to colleagues and came back to confirm they are not doing it</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just this minute been told by nurse on ward that I do need it and will be going down shortly!!</p>
				<p class="from-me">All good fun!</p>

				<p class="from-me">Indeed I am</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hello. I am now going to go for a swim… but only for about half an hour. X</p>
				<p class="from-me">I've just been told that visiting is still not allowed  by the nurse who told us to go outside the ward yesterday. I think she is in charge. Have you heard anything?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I don't think you are going to be allowed in even if you have not been notified.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">OK That’s a Shame. She knows I had provisionally booked a visit?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes. She said she will turn a blind eye if we want to stand outside the ward again but I don't know if a video call is just as good</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Standing outside the ward means you can have sandals, Diet Coke and a Kit Kat…</p>
				<p class="from-me">I can cope without all three. It was a nice treat but it's up to you</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No, it’s entirely up to you. X</p>
				<p class="from-me">Shall we skip today and come in tomorrow instead?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Yes, sounds like a plan. And what time shall we have a video chat?</p>
				<p class="from-me">7?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am at the Waterwitch then…</p>
				<p class="from-me">Any time is fine for me. I don't have too much else lined up</p>
				<p class="from-roz">OK. what time is your evening meal?</p>
				<p class="from-me">It's s sandwich. It doesn't matter</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Let’s say 5pm, then. Will the scan be today, or do you have no idea</p>
				<p class="from-me">No idea. About an hour or so ago the same nurse was surprised I had not been back yet.</p>
				<p class="from-me">If the scan is at 5 so be it</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I know, if you have not gone in an hour, we will have a chat then. And if you have gone, then at 5.00
				<BR>Is that a plan?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you there?</p>

                <p class="from-me">Another tremendous development. Because I am still infectious and as mentioned earlier could have something like TB, I have to wear a mask on the ward. They are however trying to find a "side room" where I will be on my own. Deep joy</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok?</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Hello. How did you sleep? X</p>
				<p class="from-me">Intermittently but did get quite a few good hours. Completely fast asleep at 6:30 and got woken up for a COVID test ffs.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Have you been having them regularly?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I think that is the third since I came on here. It may be more</p>
				<p class="from-me">They are not usually at 6;30 in the morning</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Oh, ok.<BR>I was thinking in the night when I couldn’t sleep… will you try and ask the doctor why you are still having blood thinning injections if there is no blood clot? It could be that someone has not updated your records correctly. Just a thought.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Thanks.</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Indeed</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Did they say anything or just take the blood?</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Just got home. How are you doing? Any activity? Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">I'm fine. Had more blood taken and had my old cannula taken out and a new one put in my right arm. (The thing everything goes in and out of)</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Any idea what this blood is for?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Currently having my second dose of antibiotics. It takes 90 minutes</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Oh…ok…</p>
				<p class="from-me">They said something about special tests this morning but no idea what. I don't know if that means testing for TB or something. She also said they were being rushed through, I assume so the results are available for the meeting</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Well, at least there is some activity…..</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes. Certainly plenty of activity in the last 24 hours!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Do you know which antibiotic they are now using?</p>
				<p class="from-me">co trimoxazole</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Co-trimoxazole is used to treat certain bacterial infections, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), bronchitis (infection of the tubes leading to the lungs), and infections of the urinary tract, ears, and intestines. It also is used to treat 'travelers' diarrhea.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Seems like a reasonable choice</p>
				<p class="from-me">I know. I can use Google too!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">But you didn’t tell me anything so I had to do it myself 😊</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Have you spoken to your Mum today?</p>
				<p class="from-me">No. Not really got any news yet.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Yes. That’s what I thought. I am off down to the library in 10 mins. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Good luck!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am back… how are you?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Same. Afternoon nap time. This place really is cold when there is a strong wind. There is a small gap at the top of the window and the wind really forces the cold air through it. And that's not another fever, everyone is complaining.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I have just spoken to my mum</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Okey dokey…xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Eating lunch, then will give you a ring</p>
				<p class="from-me">Okay</p>
				<p class="from-me">New bloke opposite me complete wanker. Younger than me and had not got into bed yet. Moaning and winging that no-one will take out for a fag</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Oh dear…</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Your Mum is not in, but I left a message on the answering machine.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok. The doctor asked me if we had pets. I could be allergic to Sid</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Sid…. Surely not… the coughing was bad in Bonaire.<BR>Sid says where will you live if you can’t live here with him.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Thanks Sid</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am home and ready whenever you are.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">You ok?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Fine just eaten</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Perhaps you should hide it… so the same thing can’t happen again🤣</p>
				<p class="from-me">I have done.</p>
				<p class="from-me">The bloke opposite is still fully dressed including coat, boots and baseball hat. He has his hospital gown over this lot. I'm sat in pyjama trousers and the temperature is fine.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Does he have mental health problems?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I don't think that is beyond the realms of possibility.</p>
				<p class="from-me">He just came and stood by my bed to look out of my window. I told him that this is an infection bay and it was likely that I was the one that is infected. Told him probably not a good idea to come near my bed again. He's gone back to his own bed</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Well done….</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. Has he calmed down?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am off to bed - completely knackered.<BR>Night, night… love you lots. Xx</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Oh dear. Coughing a lot. Have you complained? Or do the nurses all know?</p>

				<BR>Please try and ask to speak to a doctor to find out what the options are when you are not responding to antibiotics. 
				<BR>I will try and call the ward this afternoon and ask for information.</p>
				<p class="from-me">It's not that bad. I am used to listening to it at home.</p>

				<p class="from-roz">https://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/simple-blood-test-for-pneumonia-can-help-limit-use-of-antibiotics</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just seen the consultant. Basically they can not do anything until Wednesday. She asked loads of questions mainly lifestyle. "Which countries have you been to in the last ten years?"
				<BR>
				<BR>I think I am going to be moved into a"side room". She seemed very interested in the fact that this is something I could have picked up on some exotica location and has taken time to come through</p>
				<p class="from-me">She also mentioned final infection so basically they really don't know</p>
				<p class="from-me">Fungal</p>
				<p class="from-me">Already on paracetamol for high temp. Not a fever 37.7 but they are trying to get out down before it becomes a fever</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Oh no….. rubbish day….</p>
				<p class="from-me">I don't really mind. If they get my temperature down now and I don't have to take paracetamol just before bed that would be ideal</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just spoken to my mum.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Had about 90 minutes sleep since lunch. The noisiest patient in here disappeared yesterday evening</p>

                <p class="from-me">Don't let Paddy anywhere near them!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Do I need to post Easter stuff to them?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I can't see us going down there before Easter but there is still plenty of time</p>
				<p class="from-me">Did I tell you the trees are being done 14 16 April. Not sure if that means all three days or just one of them</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No, you never said. So that means Thursday. I have just booked a class at the gym.
				<BR>What time?<BR>Just parked.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Don't know and I don't know if anyone needs to be in</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. I am in the hospital if you want to get prepared.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I am prepared!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am outside D1</p>
				<p class="from-me">The nurse who told us to party outside last week is on duty again today. She is by far the best of the nurses here. When I got back she said "you haven't sneaked out while i wasn't looking have you?" She was impressed with the contents of the bag!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you there?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/122168816#/?channel=RES_BUY</p>
				<p class="from-me">That's a bit of a shock</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Indeed. I was just browsing and looking at houses for sale in Kingsclere… and found it.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Are you thinking of moving?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No - we were talking about a house for sale on King John Road with Kevin on Friday and thought I would have a look at it.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Anyway, we are getting sleepy so will say night night. Love you.</p>

                <p class="from-roz">They look like these out of the box.... although I swapped the bigger bunny from milk to dark</p>
                <p class="from-roz">And the egg on the first one was broken. I don't think it is on "yours".</p>
                <img class="from-roz" src="images/wa/IMG-20220412-WA0002.jpg"></img>
				<p class="from-roz">We are getting ready for Easter</p>
				<p class="from-me">It doesn't bother me too much whether it is broken or not to be honest</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I have posted the stuff to your Mum and Ayla. I asked Raj for a box and I meant the PO ones you buy at the post office. However, he sent Hamish off to find a box for me. So they are in a box which previously held 12 packs of biscuits.
				<BR>The way he told Hamish to go  fund a box was just how Louise tells him to do stuff. 🤗</p>
				<p class="from-me">Excellent!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I had taken bubble wrap, sellotape and scissors with me.<BR>Hopefully they will get there by Saturday… posted first class. X</p>

				<p class="from-me">Now you know what I have to put up with.</p>
                <p class="from-roz">A filling in May, a prescription for special toothpaste and a hygienist appointment in 45 minutes.</p>
				<p class="from-me">No messing about there</p>
				<p class="from-roz">The dentist said I needed to see the hygienist and the offer was an appointment at 11:30 or September</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Can you watch the BBC via your Sky Go? The snooker world championships start on Saturday…</p>
				<p class="from-me">Good news. Should be able watch it with iPlayer</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Fine. I need to floss daily…</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Your Mun called me whilst I was at the hygienist… I have tried to call back 3 times but she is engaged.<BR>Have you spoken to her?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am off to the library in 10 mins so won’t be able to call her back. And I want to go swimming directly after the library.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok I will call her</p>
				<p class="from-me">Bertie says who's a librarian?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">5 customers today, but with 3 volunteers, we coped!</p>
				<p class="from-me">We are about to move to a double room</p>
				<p class="from-me">The room is good in the isolation unit with plenty of space and en suite toilet and shower. The bad news is I'm not allowed to leave it</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Ooh yes. How is the beeping?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just stopped it. There is a box at the end of the bed which seems to vibrate for ten seconds every ten minutes for no obvious reason. There is a button on it to turn the sound off</p>

				<p class="from-me">Fine. Still in room.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Any news?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok?</p>
				<p class="from-me">At 9:35 they told me I was booked in for 9:30 but they were running late. Two minutes later I was told they needed more blood samples as they are concerned about blood coagulation levels. I have been told I still can't drink anything but she did not really know what was going on.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">FFS</p>
				<p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am going for a swim xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">I  have just had my first shower which was superb</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Good</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just been told definitely before lunch. We will see. They have me on a drop to keep me hydrated at the moment as I can not drink water</p>
				<p class="from-me">Drip!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Ok</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No updates I assume.<BR>Is you blood to think or thin for the procedure?</p>
				<p class="from-me">The nurse here seemed to think it would go ahead. She said that because of the possibility of TB I had to go on last as the room will require a deep clean</p>
				<p class="from-roz">That does make some sense.</p>
				<p class="from-me">She still thinks it will be before lunch which is why I am on the drip</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I hope so🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Doctor been. He seems confident that stronger antibiotics will clear it so changing again.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">What about the camera?</p>
				<p class="from-me">TB. He says the tests can only really tell if you have been in contact with someone with TB. All the tests so far are negative but some tests have to be sent away and can take many days for the results.</p>
				<p class="from-me">He said it is still happening</p>
				<p class="from-me">I am on my way down now</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you back?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes. Give me 30 mins. I'm fine</p>
				<p class="from-roz">👍</p>
				<p class="from-me">No water since 7 and not allowed until two. Coughing a lot</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Poor you. Did it hurt a lot? X</p>
				<p class="from-me">It was really uncomfortable for about twenty minutes. I was supposed to be sedated. The doctor did say it was a bit hot and miss but I don't reckon they gave me enough. I was totally awake through the whole thing</p>
				<p class="from-me">Seven hours within water now. I am so thirsty</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Yes, I bet. Is there water there for 2pm… or will you need to ask?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I will drive home and you call me when you are able to drink.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Is that a plan?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I have just asked for water</p>
				<p class="from-me">I can drink in four minutes</p>
				<p class="from-me">Call me when you are home</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Thank you. I will do that. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">1. Have you spoken to your Mum.?<BR>2. I was thinking of calling the tree man to find out when he was coming.</p>
				<p class="from-me">1 Yes<BR>2 probably a good idea</p>
				<p class="from-me">Let me know when you are in</p>

                <p class="from-me">Not that difficult Meropenem</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Meropenem, sold under the brand name Merrem among others, is an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.[1] Some of these include meningitis, intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, sepsis, and anthrax.[1]</p>

				<BR>
				<BR>Queries for Consultant
				<BR>
				<BR>	1.	Infection continues to drop? How low does it need to get?
				<BR>
				<BR>	2.	How do we ensure it goes completely? 
				<BR>
				<BR>	3.	I have read about hard to clear mucus which requires nebulisers / breathing exercises / physio. Do I need this? 
				<BR>If the mucus remains can this cause a re infection? 
				<BR>
				<BR>	4.	Is it possible that the infection was fungal?
				<BR>	5.	What about all the other tests from my bronchoscopy?
				<BR>	6.	What about the irregularities found on my X-rays / scan? Is this something to worry about?
				<BR>	7.	Could there be an underlying cause to  my infection considering I had one in early Feb. and have been coughing for well over 4 months.</p>
				<p class="from-me">OK</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Just had Nina on the phone for half an hour…. she sends her best wishes.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. Off out on my bike. I am going to cycle into Newbury, and back. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">1 he did give me the numbers and we are nearly there.
				<BR>2 once the numbers are low enough they are happy it is gone
				<BR>3 again, he did not seem interested. As I am active and can move around he did not think it was necessary. Seems to be more for people who are immobile.
				<BR>4 yes
				<BR>5 sometime this week
				<BR>6 still looking into those
				<BR>7 they have no real idea</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi Tried to call you</p>

                <p class="from-roz">Nebuliser?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are they putting any medicine in it? Or is it simply to try and breakdown mucus?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Not that I am aware of</p>
				<p class="from-me">I think they consider that my mucus is a bit thick. How are the silly ones?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Paddy says Bertie has been told it’s a bit thick as well. Bertie is a bit confused as to exactly what is thick. 🤔</p>
				<p class="from-roz">The doctor has not been back then?</p>
				<p class="from-me">No</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Still on the nebuliser?</p>

				<BR>I can’t find a way of checking what each of my 28 caps are for, so no way of checking if the last two games have been allocated to me correctly. 
				<BR>I am now in the car park of David Lloyd. Will do the registration for Germany later. 
				<BR>We also need to apply for World Cup tickets in the next week. 
				<BR>No sign of a doctor at all?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I have 30 but also can not find where you check.<BR><BR>No doctor yet</p>
				<p class="from-roz">You should be two more than me. So we are both in the same position.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just seen doctor. Things still coming down which is good I think they are trying to get me out of here as soon as possible but both agreed that it is better to stay a few more days on intravenous antibiotics than to risk it coming back again.</p>
				<p class="from-me">No results from bronchoscopy yet</p>
				<p class="from-me">If you want to see which games you have been awarded caps for, log in and go to this address, changing my number for yours:

				<p class="from-roz">🤗</p>
				<p class="from-me">I had nodded off for a while then</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No worries.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Did that work?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Haven’t tried yet.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. Just tried it and it’s 32 caps! Although the other page I looked at earlier said 28.<BR>So looks like we are getting somewhere.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Does it list the last two games</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No… the list is obviously not updated.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes mine is the same</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Just registered for Germany for us both.<BR>Will finish my cup of coffee and then drive in</p>
				<p class="from-me">OK</p>
				<p class="from-me">Can you bring my mum's get well soon card. She keeps asking about it</p>
				<p class="from-roz">It’s already in the bag. Do you want grapes?</p>
				<p class="from-me">No thanks</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am in the hospital. Just press the bell like last time?</p>

                <p class="from-date">21st April</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Morning. How did you sleep? X</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. Dave
				<BR>These are some questions….for a respiratory doctor. Don’t ask them if you are uncomfortable with any of them. They are my thoughts…. 
				<BR>
				<BR>I love you. 
				<BR>
				<BR>	1.	How do we ensure the infection goes completely? Is there anything I should be doing once I am discharged?                
				<BR>	2.	Am I now susceptible to chest infections. 
				<BR>	3.	Will I get the pneumonia vaccination? 
				<BR>	4.	I know infections need rest. But I am aware I will need to start exercising once I am home. Is there any guidance or programmes or just what feels right for me. 
				<BR>	5.	Tell them the nebuliser seems to be working.  (So it continues, particularly because some doctors didn’t think you needed it)
				<BR>The following are the same questions as previously….
				<BR>	a.Is it possible that the infection was fungal?
				<BR>	b. What about all the other tests from my bronchoscopy?
				<BR>	c. What about the irregularities found on my X-rays / scan? Is this something to worry about?
				<BR>	d. Could there be an underlying cause to  my infection considering I had one in early Feb. and have been coughing for well over 4 months.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am off for a swim now. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Love you. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Give me a ring when you can</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I have left a message on your Mum’s phone. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">I assume she is with Jane</p>
				<p class="from-me">Been on the nebuliser again</p>
                <img class="from-roz" src="images/wa/IMG-20220421-WA0000.jpg"></img>
				<p class="from-roz">Will stop doing daily tests now🤣</p>
                <p class="from-me">Some good news!!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Holiday Inn Express in Derby has to be cancelled by tomorrow. I have your account open. Are you happy for me to cancel it?</p>
				<p class="from-me">I think we are going to have to sadly</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I hope you will be discharged by then. But we will need to visit your Mum / somewhere more relaxing than Derby/Nottm pubs. 🤔<BR>I have also started a claim to N’wide travel insurance for the Wizz Air flights.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I agree</p>
				<p class="from-me">I usually end up very relaxed after the pubs of Nottingham and Derby!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Done</p>
				<p class="from-me">1. Once the infection markers are below a certain level they are happy that the infection has cleared up.
				<BR>
				<BR>2. No
				<BR>
				<BR>3. Didn't ask.
				<BR>
				<BR>4. Exercise as much as I want but so if breathless
				<BR>
				<BR>5. Both agree that nebuliser is working so will continue</p>
				<p class="from-me">Everything from bronchoscopy has come back negative which is good news</p>
				<p class="from-me">MDT = Multi Disciplinary Team</p>
				<p class="from-me">MDT meet once a week. Need for them to meet and discuss my case before I can come out. Doctor not sure when meeting is.</p>
				<p class="from-me">4. Stop if breathless</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am home again. Just one customer.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Did you enjoy it or are you going to find out too boring</p>
				<p class="from-roz">The other volunteer today was lovely. We chatted for about half of the time…. And I had a book to read.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Shall we video chat at 6:30?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok</p>
				<p class="from-me">6;35</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Ok. You call me. X</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hello. I have spoken to both your Mum and your sister.<BR>Well,really it was your Mum speaking to me… but you know what I mean.</p>
				<p class="from-me">How are they both</p>
				<p class="from-me">All done early tonight antibiotics and nebuliser. Time for bed. Night night. Love you</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Hi. What are you watching?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Soccer Saturday. It's about two minutes behind flash scores.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Should win now!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">How did we let them score… but looks like it’s 3-1 now. Just on my Soccer Saturday</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Ie at least a minute after flash scores</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Wouldn’t want to be late back  in your seat in your game</p>
				<p class="from-me">Indeed. Fell asleep through most of second half! Good results for you.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">It’s all so tight, though.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Have you seen a doctor today?</p>
				<p class="from-me">No</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I wonder why…</p>
				<p class="from-me">Don't know. I'm quite surprised. Perhaps there is just nothing to tell me but I thought they came round anyway. It is Saturday. Probably not enough doctors.</p>
				<p class="from-me">What have you got prepared for St. George's night?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Two bottles of JHB, a pie, a can of Northern Monk and the English Spirit Company chocolate chilli vodka.</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Yes, I thought the same. So keep away from ibuprofen as well as aspirin.

				<p class="from-roz">Just been around to Louise’s for a doorstep chat.</p>

				<p class="from-roz">I will be off to the gym in a few minutes.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just having my mid-morning tea and chocolate</p>
				<p class="from-roz">🤗</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No news I suppose…</p>
				<p class="from-me">Can I call you</p>
				<p class="from-me">Nothing wrong!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Missed video call</p>
				<p class="from-me">I probably exaggerated when I said a couple of days. He needs to speak to micro biology to determine which Oral antibiotics I can move to. They need to give the ok and then monitor levels for a couple of days to check they are working. Then I can come home.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Everything else can be done as an out patient</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. How you doing? Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">I'm fine. Still on my Morse book. Managed to resist the chocolate 🐰 so far but the jelly babies are going down quite quickly.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Did you still have the 2pm antibiotics by IV?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes. I think it will be at least 24 hours before any change. Probably longer..... which is more frustrating. I feel it is so close to getting out now but everything is still going to take time</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Yes indeed. What time shall we have a video call?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Any time. 6:15 - 6:45 not good. Do you want to do it before or after that?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Let’s do after that … you call me when it’s good for you…</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Night night. Love you loads and see you tomorrow. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Night night my big silly one. Love you too!</p>
                <p class="from-date">26th April</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Morning. Birthday greetings. Are you ok? Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Thank you and Happy Anniversary! I'm fine</p>
				<p class="from-me">Wordle in five</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I will make a cup of coffee and feed Sid, then can I call you?</p>
				<p class="from-me">Ok I'll have tea please</p>
				<p class="from-me">On nebuliser for next 15 mins. Will call you</p>
				<p class="from-roz">👍</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Two goes at wordle.., and now I am completely stuck. I have four of the letters with only T in the right place at the end. And I need to fit in an E,H and I.  And the E and the H each only have  two options left.<BR>Time to go swimming. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">My second word was EIGHT</p>
				<p class="from-me">It's not a commonly used word!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Still thinking… can’t come up with any words. I am starting to make up words! Will have one more go after spinning. Then will have to resort to word hippo for help!! X</p>
				<p class="from-me">Some sort of emergency has occurred half way through changing my bed sheets. All nurses disappeared. Grrrrr</p>
				<p class="from-me">Bed made!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Poor Dave… I suppose emergencies do happen in hospital.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am either going to get wordle in 3 or never finish🤣</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I also think I before e unless after c May not apply</p>
				<p class="from-me">Bertie says not long until tea and chocolate. He says another bunny may lose its head 🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰</p>
				<p class="from-roz">He is becoming quite aggressive. Is he on some sort of drugs? X</p>
				<p class="from-me">He says it's his birthday!</p>

				<p class="from-roz">The guessing of words eventually worked!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I think I have heard of the word.., a surprise attack??</p>
				<p class="from-me">More a robbery. A diamond heist</p>
                <p class="from-roz">Apparently it means a robbery. Indeed just googled it.<BR>I have had loads of guesses, but none of them were real words.<BR>So getting it in 3 looks good, but it’s not really.</p>

				<p class="from-me">Just spoke to a doctor. Shortest doctor visit yet and I hardly asked any questions. They are aiming to get me home tomorrow!</p>
				<p class="from-me">I may not have been exaggerating with my home in a couple of days!</p>
				<p class="from-me">On nebuliser for next 15 mins</p>
				<p class="from-roz">😀😀</p>
				<p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Call me when you come off nebuliser…x</p>

				<p class="from-roz">They are beutiful xxxx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Need to find some vases</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok? I am still in Starbucks. Will leave at about 4pm.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Fine</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. I am in the hospital already, shall I come up do you think? Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes</p>
				<p class="from-me">That was superb! My second sandwich, a few hula hoops, the yogurt followed by a Lindour chocolate. I'm in bed feeling very content..... and full</p>
				<p class="from-me">I could not have hoped for a much better birthday meal. It is incredible how good normal food tastes after three weeks of hospital food</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Just got in… I am so pleased. It was brilliant to see you.<BR>Hopefully not long now. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">There is a Soccer Special.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I know, thanks. Just put it on</p>

				<p class="from-me">I think Piroe could be off in the summer</p>
				<p class="from-me">Oh dear</p>
				<p class="from-me">Jane is trying to ring you</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No she isn’t</p>
				<p class="from-me">Just had my first oral antibiotic and had my cannula removed. Nurse reckons tomorrow.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Neither phone is ringing.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">👍👍👍👍</p>
				<p class="from-me">Jane said she was. I had to cut the call short due to antibiotic and nebuliser</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Just tried to call her. No reply.</p>
				<p class="from-me">No idea what is happening</p>
				<p class="from-me">Will try and call her back in 10 mins when this is finished. I got all over excited when I saw the tablet!!!!</p>
				<p class="from-me">Which was just after she called me</p>
				<p class="from-me">Did you speak to Jane?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Yes. Through all of half time when I was going to call you.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Well …. a good moment for me, at about exactly the same time as you conceded</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you there?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">What’s happened?</p>

				<p class="from-roz">You have to laugh😂😂xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Indeed</p>
				<p class="from-me">Bertie says he hopes we don't get let out before 11:00 as that is tea and bunny time.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am sure that won’t be a problem.</p>
				<p class="from-me">World cup application looks good. Are you going to update three sheets with all our bookings?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">I am not sure that is entirely necessary. 🤔</p>
				<p class="from-me">First morning since I have been here that they have not offered to change my sheets.   I got a clean towel but no sheets!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">That sounds positive. Do you like dried apricots (they are high in iron)?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Which nuts do you like as they are also good for iron.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I don't think I have ever had an apricot, died out otherwise. Happy to give them a go.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I used to eat bags of mixed nuts but I can't think of any that I do not like. Can I just eat the ferero rocher or whatever they are called</p>
				<p class="from-me">dried or otherwise</p>
				<p class="from-me">Slightly disappointing but it is a definite tomorrow morning. 24 more hours. They are going to start getting my discharge papers ready and will give me the full month's worth of antibiotics (so no waiting around)</p>
				<p class="from-me">Bertie says it's time for tea and bunny.</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Hi. Just tried to call. Call me when you can. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Are you ok? Disappointed about today, but I would rather them do all the checks than you be discharged and then get worse again at home.</p>
				<p class="from-me">I'm fine. Just had an apple and blackberry crumble with ice cream which was one of the best things they have given me to eat since I got here</p>
				<p class="from-roz">How are you?<BR>Just got in and a couple of slices of toast. 
				<BR>As I couldn’t come and pick you up I decided to do Pilates and go for a swim after the weights class.<BR>Any more updates?</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Sorry, doesn’t make sense… And have HAD a couple of slices of toast.</p>
				<img class="from-roz" src="images/wa/IMG-20220427-WA0002.jpg"></img>
				<p class="from-roz">My rather unusual grocery shopping earlier... </p>
				<p class="from-me">Looks lovely!</p>
				<p class="from-me">Nothing happening yet re tea or nebuliser. Don't panic if call a bit late!</p>
				<p class="from-roz">No worries… perhaps they think you have come home.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Unbelievably quiet here today. It seems everyone else has gone home.</p>
				<p class="from-me">Yes has arrived</p>
				<p class="from-me">Tea</p>
				<p class="from-roz">👍</p>
				<p class="from-me">Nothing too exciting happening still although I have been promised another cup of tea</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Lovely. X</p>
				<p class="from-me">I have my doubts as to whether or not it will arrive while I am still awake but we shall see</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Night night sleep tight. I love you. Xx</p>
				<p class="from-me">Night night. No tea! Love you!</p>
                <p class="from-date">28th April</p>
				<p class="from-roz">Good Morning. How are you? X</p>

				<p class="from-roz">Oh dear. But apart from that??!</p>
				<p class="from-me">Fine</p>
