<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday 9th June</span> We left home at 6:30ish and had a 45 minute drive down to Portsmouth. We stopped at Tesco to stock up on food for tomorrow's journey and then drove to Port Solent Wetherpoons for a curry. We drove to the port and checked in for the ferry at about 9pm.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">It was a relief to be checked in and waiting in the queue for the ferry as yesterday's equivelent sailing had been cancelled due to the strikes in France. We boarded the ferry by about 10:30, dropped our stuff in our cabin and went up to the bar for a drink before going to sleep. Plenty of football fans in the bar, mainly Welsh, but no-one was too lively due to the long drives ahead tomorrow.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 10th June</span> We were up by 7ish local time and the ferry docked on time at 8:30. It took almost an hour to get off the ferry and out of the port area but by about 9:30 we were on our way for the start of our 600 mile drive towards Marseille.</p>
<p  class="diary-text">The journey was not too bad most of the way. It all went pretty smoothly until Lyon where we were delayed for about an hour which was frustrating but the rest of the journey was fine. We had three stops on the way totalling about an hour and the worries about petrol were totally unfounded.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">The only time we had any problems with directions was when we got lost coming off the main road in Marsaielle but our sat-nav got us back to the area where we are staying and we made it to our apartment by about 8:15.
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-001.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">We had exchanged a few texts with the owner of our apartment on the way down (all in French) and there had been a lot of confusion about our arrival, but Mark had arrived before us and had got the key and was waiting when we arrived. It took about 15 minutes to ge the car parked but once we had done that, we dumped our bags in the apartment and went straight out to watch the opening game of the tournament. We got the metro into the centre of Marseille and were sat down in a bar with our first beer about two minutes befreo kick-off.
</p>

<p  class="diary-text">We knew there was trouble around the old port area so had got off the metro a stop before there and found an ideal bar with only a few other people in it. We watched the game in there before getting the metro back to the apartment where we were joined by Steve who had flown in to Lyon and been given a lift down with friends. We bought a few beers from a local shop and stayed up drinking on our balcony until about 3am.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th June </span>Had a late start to the day as we were not really awake until 11ish. We had breakfast on the balcony of the apartment and headed into the centre of Marseille at about 12:45. We got the metro into the old port area and spet an hour or so wandering round there. The atmosphere was all fairly good at this point although it was obvious that there was potential for trouble in the bars where a lot of our fans were gathered.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
After looking round a few of the sights we decided to get away from the area and headed inland to find a bar to watch the Switzerland v Albania game. We stopped for a beer with a couple of people we knew from Ukraine and then caught a tram back to the bar we had been drinking in last night. We got away from the area where most of the trouble was to occur less than an hour before it all started.
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-002.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
After the first game had finshed we got the metro towards the ground and found another bar to watch Wales v Slovakia. As we were about to leave here, there was more trouble outside as England fans were attacked by Russians and we had a few things thrown through the windows. All quite dramatic but no-one in the pub was hurt and we were able to leave after a few minutes. There was still trouble taking place ahead of us as we walked towards the ground but once through the first police check, everything calmed down and we were able to get into the ground relatively smoothly.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
The ground itself was one of the most spectacular we have seen and the atmosphere was also superb. The game was good and would have been perfect apart from the late equaliser. More trouble from the Russians at the final whistle meant that we were keen to get away from the ground as quickly as possible. we had planned to go back to the bar where we had watched the Wales game but the police had (sensibly) closed all the bars in the area and we decided to go straight back to the apartment.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
Roz and I walked a mile or so back to the Metro line 1 and got a train  back to Sant Juste. We had a 20 minute wait for Mark and Steve to get back due to problems on the metro so waited outside the apartment with a beer and were back in by about 12:15. A very good day despite the trouble!
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-003.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th June </span>Steve was colleced by his mates at about 10:30 and Mark Roz and myself left the apartment at 11:15 after the owner had been round to collect the key. We said goodbye to Filo (the owners cat that we had been looking after) and started driving North. We had a detour to visit the aquaduct at Pont du Gard which was quite spectacular and then drove about three hours further to Mâcon. We did not really know where we would be staying but this seemed a reasonable town for a night. We arrived just before 6pm, checked into the hotel we had booked while on the way and then headed out to find a bar to watch the Northern Ireland v Poland game.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
A lot of places were closed as it is Sunday but we found a couple of decent bars and then a pizza place to watch the Germany v Ukraine match. We got through a couple of litres of wine during the game and had a pretty good night in the end.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 13th June </span>We left the hotel at 9ish and continued our journey North. We had a four hour drive to Reims where we were to meet Regan, Annette, Julie and Anne. We stopped at McDonalds for breakfast and had one petrol stop but it was a fairly uneventful journey. We arrived in Reims at about 2:30 and found our hotel without too many problems. We parked in the underground garage and were in our apartment just after 3:00.
</p>
<div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-004.JPG"></div>
<p  class="diary-text">
We could not watch the 3:00 game on our tele as it is only on satellite TV for some reason and none of us could be bothered to go out and watch it. Instead, we had lunch and then Roz and I went out for a walk around Reims. We headed out to the Mumm Champagne Cellars and booked all of us onto a tour of the cellars for tomorrow afternoon. We then had a walk around the town centre. The cathedral is supposed to be one of the most spectacular in France but the first thing you notice about it as you approach is the amount of scaffolding on it. It did not look too impressive but we did only have a quick look at it before heading back to the apartment.
</p>
<p  class="diary-text">
We walked back via a street which had plenty of decent looking bars on it. We met up with the others back at the apartment and the seven of us all headed out just before 6. We returned to the street we had walked along earlier and went to Les 3 Brasseurs - The Three Brewers - and settled in for the Sweden v Ireland game. It was an excellent bar with a good selection of its own beers. We moved to another table to eat after the game and stayed there for the 9:00 game as well. We left there after the game having paid about €270 between us. Julie, Anne and Annette went back to the hotel at that point while the rest of us went to another couple of bars. Vaguely remember getting back to the apartment at about 2am. A very good night out!
