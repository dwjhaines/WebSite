                We left home at 6:30ish and had a 45 minute drive down to Portsmouth. We stopped
                at Tesco to stock up on food for tomorrow's journey and then drove to Port
                Solent Wetherpoons for a curry. We drove to the port and checked in for the
                ferry at about 9pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a relief to be checked in and waiting in the queue
                for the ferry as yesterday's equivalent sailing had been cancelled due to the
                strikes in France. We boarded the ferry by about 10:30, dropped our stuff in our
                cabin and went up to the bar for a drink before going to sleep. Plenty of
                football fans in the bar, mainly Welsh, but no-one was too lively due to the
                long drives ahead tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th June</span>
                We were up by 7ish local time and the ferry docked on time at 8:30. It took
                almost an hour to get off the ferry and out of the port area but by about 9:30
                we were on our way for the start of our 600 mile drive towards Marseille.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The journey was not too bad most of the way. It all went
                pretty smoothly until Lyon where we were delayed for about an hour which was
                frustrating but the rest of the journey was fine. We had three stops on the way
                totalling about an hour and the worries about petrol were totally unfounded.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The only time we had any problems with directions was when
                we got lost coming off the main road in Marsaille but our sat-nav got us back to
                the area where we are staying and we made it to our apartment by about 8:15.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had exchanged a few texts with the owner of our
                apartment on the way down (all in French) and there had been a lot of confusion
                about our arrival, but Mark had arrived before us and had got the key and was
                waiting when we arrived. It took about 15 minutes to get the car parked but once
                we had done that, we dumped our bags in the apartment and went straight out to
                watch the opening game of the tournament. We got the metro into the centre of
                Marseille and were sat down in a bar with our first beer about two minutes
                before kick-off.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We knew there was trouble around the old port area so had
                got off the metro a stop before there and found an ideal bar with only a few
                other people in it. We watched the game in there before getting the metro back
                to the apartment where we were joined by Steve who had flown in to Lyon and been
                given a lift down with friends. We bought a few beers from a local shop and
                stayed up drinking on our balcony until about 3am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th June - England v Russia
                </span>Had a late start to the day as we were not really awake until 11ish. We
                had breakfast on the balcony of the apartment and headed into the centre of
                Marseille at about 12:45. We got the metro into the old port area and spent an
                hour or so wandering round there. The atmosphere was all fairly good at this
                point although it was obvious that there was potential for trouble in the bars
                where a lot of our fans were gathered.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After looking round a few of the sights we decided to get away from the area and
                headed inland to find a bar to watch the Switzerland v Albania game. We stopped
                for a beer with a couple of people we knew from Ukraine and then caught a tram
                back to the bar we had been drinking in last night. We got away from the area
                where most of the trouble was to occur less than an hour before it all started.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After the first game had finished we got the metro towards the ground and found
                another bar to watch Wales v Slovakia. As we were about to leave here, there was
                more trouble outside as England fans were attacked by Russians and we had a few
                things thrown through the windows. All quite dramatic but no-one in the pub was
                hurt and we were able to leave after a few minutes. There was still trouble
                taking place ahead of us as we walked towards the ground but once through the
                first police check, everything calmed down and we were able to get into the
                ground relatively smoothly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The ground itself was one of the most spectacular we have seen and the
                atmosphere was also superb. The game was good and would have been perfect apart
                from the late equaliser. More trouble from the Russians at the final whistle
                meant that we were keen to get away from the ground as quickly as possible. We
                had planned to go back to the bar where we had watched the Wales game but the
                police had (sensibly) closed all the bars in the area and we decided to go
                straight back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I walked a mile or so back to the Metro line 1 and got a train back to
                Sant Juste. We had a 20 minute wait for Mark and Steve to get back due to
                problems on the metro so waited outside the apartment with a beer and were back
                in by about 12:15. A very good day despite the trouble!
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th June
                </span>Steve was collected by his mates at about 10:30 and Mark, Roz and myself
                left the apartment at 11:15 after the owner had been round to collect the key.
                We said goodbye to Filo (the owners cat that we had been looking after) and
                started driving North. We had a detour to visit the aquaduct at Pont du Gard
                which was quite spectacular and then drove about three hours further to Mâcon.
                We did not really know where we would be staying but this seemed a reasonable
                town for a night. We arrived just before 6pm, checked into the hotel we had
                booked while on the way and then headed out to find a bar to watch the Northern
                Ireland v Poland game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                A lot of places were closed as it is Sunday but we found a couple of decent bars
                and then a pizza place to watch the Germany v Ukraine match. We got through a
                couple of litres of wine during the game and had a pretty good night in the end.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 13th June
                </span>We left the hotel at 9ish and continued our journey North. We had a four
                hour drive to Reims where we were to meet Regan, Annette, Julie and Anne. We
                stopped at McDonalds for breakfast and had one petrol stop but it was a fairly
                uneventful journey. We arrived in Reims at about 2:30 and found our hotel
                without too many problems. We parked in the underground garage and were in our
                apartment just after 3:00.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-004.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not watch the 3:00 game on our tele as it is only on satellite TV for
                some reason and none of us could be bothered to go out and watch it. Instead, we
                had lunch and then Roz and I went out for a walk around Reims. We headed out to
                the Mumm Champagne Cellars and booked all of us onto a tour of the cellars for
                tomorrow afternoon. We then had a walk around the town centre. The cathedral is
                supposed to be one of the most spectacular in France but the first thing you
                notice about it as you approach is the amount of scaffolding on it. It did not
                look too impressive but we did only have a quick look at it before heading back
                to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back via a street which had plenty of decent looking bars on it. We
                met up with the others back at the apartment and the seven of us all headed out
                just before 6. We returned to the street we had walked along earlier and went to
                Les 3 Brasseurs - The Three Brewers - and settled in for the Sweden v Ireland
                game. It was an excellent bar with a good selection of its own beers. We moved
                to another table to eat after the game and stayed there for the 9:00 game as
                well. We left there after the game having paid about €270 between us. Julie,
                Anne and Annette went back to the hotel at that point while the rest of us went
                to another couple of bars. Vaguely remember getting back to the apartment at
                about 2am. A very good night out!

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th June
                </span>A bit of a late start today due to hangovers. Mark, Roz and I left the
                apartment at about 1:15 and went for another walk around the town. We had a
                closer look at the cathedral which was more impressive close up and particularly
                good inside. There was not really a lot else we wanted to see so we made our way
                from there to the Mumm champagne house where we met the others at 3:30 for the
                start of our tour.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The tour lasted just over an hour and was all quite interesting. Mumm have 25km
                of cellars and produce 8 - 9 million bottles of champagne a year. We were shown
                round a section of the cellars 14m underground where the champagne is stored.
                After wandering round the cellars, we were all given a glass to taste although
                most of us agreed we would rather have a beer!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We all stopped at a bar for a swift beer on the way back into town. Julie and
                Anne went back to the hotel while the rest of us went directly to The Three
                Brewers for the 6pm game. We stayed in there for another five hours and watched
                both the games there. Julie and Anne re-joined us for the 9:00 game and it was
                another good evening out. We were not as pissed as last night and went straight
                back to the apartment when the second game finished.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 15th June
                </span>The three of us checked out of the apartment at 10:15 after downloading
                next seasons premier league fixtures. We drove about 150 km to Haute Picardie
                where we dropped Mark at the TGV station. He is going to the Russia v Slovakia
                game with Steve (who came over on this morning's Eurostar) in Lille and this
                station was just about on the way for us.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to drive straight to Arras from here but as we were driving
                through the Somme area, we decided to stop and visit a couple of the 1st World
                War cemeteries as well as the memorial at Thiepval. The cemeteries were similar
                to the ones in Belgium and the second one in particular was well worth the
                visit. The memorial at Thiepval is something we had not heard about before but
                is the biggest British war memorial in the world and was also well worth
                stopping at. It was evident that preparations are underway for commemorating the
                100th anniversary of the start of the Battle of The Somme which is only a couple
                of weeks away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were only about 30 minutes away from Awas when we left
                Thiepval and we found our hotel by about 2:30. There was supposed to be car
                parking near the hotel but the whole car park was sealed off as the England team
                are staying at The Mercure just round the corner. We were deciding where we
                should park when a space became available outside the hotel. This is normally a
                no parking zone but we have a letter on the dashboard from hotel management and
                apparently the police will ignore the restrictions for the next two days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We have a huge room for four people - not ideal but the
                only thing we could get in the area. We were able to get BBC 1 on our tele so
                watched the Russia v Slovakia game in the room. We then went out for a walk and
                managed to coincide going out with England's arrival at their hotel. We waited
                around to taking photos (mainly of the bus) for a while before wandering round
                the rest of the town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The town centre was very Belgium looking with a couple of
                big squares. There were a few fans getting quite lively in one of them but all
                seemed fairly good natured at this point. We found a good beer shop where we
                bought a few French beers from my book and then returned to the hotel to watch
                the 6pm game. Mark and Steve arrived just after 7. We had a beer during the
                second half and then went out to eat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked round the centre again and eventually chose a
                restaurant on the road between the two squares. We had good meals again while
                watching the France v Albania game and stopped off at another bar on the way
                home. Again, there was no sign of any trouble and English and Welsh fans seemed
                happy drinking together. Got back to the hotel at about 1.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 16th June - England v Wales
                </span>We were all up by about 9:30. Roz and I walked across the road to buy
                train tickets to Lens before we all went out for breakfast. The service in the
                last place we had been in last night was painfully slow so we ended up in a
                kebab shop round the corner. Chicken kebab and a bottle of Grimbergen was not
                the healthiest start to the day but was an enjoyable enough meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a beer in another couple of bars and were also able
                to see the team departing from their hotel (more bus photos!). We got the 1:23
                train to Lens. This was not as crowded as expected. Although full of both sets
                of fans, it was a long train with plenty of space.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were in Lens by about 1:45. The advertised alcohol ban
                had certainly not been enforced as the town centre seemed to consist mainly of
                bars serving beer in plastic glasses. We were not really expecting to get
                another drink but had time for a pint before walking to the ground. We managed
                to find Regan, Julie and Anne on the way to the ground which was about a 20
                minute walk away. Mark had his wallet stolen on the way to the ground but had
                taken his ticket out so was still able to get in without problems. We got
                through the ticket checks and search areas without any problems and were in the
                ground with about 10 minutes to spare.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was one of the best England games we have
                ever seen. A poor first half but an excellent second and winning in injury time
                could not have been much better for us. It puts England top of the group and
                they are now in with a very good chance of winning it. Winning the group would
                be very good as it makes our travel for any later stages a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">No trouble after the game and the walk back to the station
                was fairly straight-forward. Again, both sets of fans were mixing with no
                problems. At the station, things were a bit more chaotic - not because of fans
                but the total incompetence of the police/station authorities. There were not
                enough trains and the solution was to not let anyone into the station. There was
                no queuing system or any form of organisation, just a large group of people
                trying to get through a single narrow entrance. We eventually all got through
                and were on a train before 6 and back in Arras by about 6:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a relatively quiet night back in Arras. We watched
                the Ukraine v Northern Ireland game in a bar round the corner from the hotel. We
                then returned to the same restaurant as last night despite saying last night we
                would not go back. The service had been very poor but the food was good, the
                beer good and it was one of the few restaurants we could find with T.V.s. We had
                another good meal before going back to the hotel to watch the highlights of our
                game on BBC1.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 17th June
                </span>We left the hotel just after 10 and drove North to Vimy to visit the
                Canadian WWI memorial and cemeteries. We had an unexpected tour of the frontline
                trenches and spent about 15 minutes in the underground tunnels that they have
                preserved there. All quite interesting again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an uneventful 500km drive from here to Beaune. We
                had one petrol/toilet/lunch stop after about an hour but did the rest of the
                journey in one go arriving in Beaune just after 5:00, Mark got a phone call from
                the FA on the way to tell him someone had found his wallet and he should be able
                to pick it up at the next game. Beaune is nice little town less than 100 miles
                from Lyon where we travel to on Sunday so made an ideal place to stay for a
                couple of nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into the centre of town from the Ibis we are
                staying in and watched the two evening games in a couple of bars. The centre
                looked excellent with plenty of really nice looking wine bars and restaurants.
                Were back in the hotel just after mid-night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 18th June
                </span>We were up quite late again and went over the road to a shopping centre
                for breakfast. For the first time in a while we had healthy things like
                smoothies and fruit which made a bit of a change. From there, Mark and Steve
                went into town while we went round the supermarket and bought a few things that
                we needed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dropped the stuff we had bought back at the car and
                then walked into town. We spent the best part of an hour walking around the old
                town and looking at a few options for wine tours. It is the nicest place we have
                been since getting to France with plenty of old buildings and it was very
                enjoyable just walking around. We met Mark and Steve at a bar with teles outside
                that was showing the 3pm game.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-010.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After a beer here, Roz and I went off to the Patriarche
                wine cellars. This was the tour that we were keenest on doing and we were not as
                bothered about watching the football as Mark and Steve. They went on a different
                tour when the football finished but the Patriarche cellars closed at 5pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The cellars were excellent and definitely one of the
                highlights of the trip so far. We were shown to the entrance to the cellars but
                were then left to wander round on our own. The cellars themselves were very
                spectacular with all the usual rows of bottles and barrels. The tour included
                tasting 13 different wines, three whites and ten reds. When we got to the first
                tasting room, the whites were out on barrels and we were able to serve
                ourselves. The wine was very nice and we were able to have as many "tastes" as
                we wanted. We eventually left this area and moved onto the reds. Again, there
                was no limit to the amount we could try. The tour cost €17 and was supposed to
                last 60 - 90 minutes. We were down there for about two hours in the end and
                certainly got our money's worth!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were fairly pissed when we came out of the cellars and
                made our way back to meet Mark and Steve. We stopped for one more drink on the
                way at a bar we had passed a few times and had liked the look of. We watched the
                second half of Iceland v Hungary game in the place we had been to twice last
                night and stayed there to eat and watch Portugal v Austria. We went straight
                back to the hotel when this game finished although the walk back is a bit of a
                vague memory!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th June
                </span>A slightly earlier start today. Roz and I walked back into the centre at
                about 9:30 for a last look around, breakfast and some souvenir shopping. We went
                back to the hotel, met up with the others, loaded up the car and left Beaune at
                about 11. We filled up with petrol and had a drive of an hour or so to Lyon
                where we will spend the next two nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found the apartment easily enough but had a few
                problems finding a parking space. Parking is a big problem in most of France.
                The French seem to be able to get their cars into impossibly small spaces and
                finding somewhere to park a car the size of a Mondeo is not easy. We eventually
                did find somewhere a few minutes away but Roz is concerned as she will be the
                one who has to get it out again on Wednesday after I have gone back to England.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-011.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were met at the apartment by the owners who gave us an
                hours description of how to use the apartment and where to find everything. We
                had an hour or so of sorting ourselves out and left the apartment at 4:00 to go
                into Lyon. We walked down to the river together and then went separate ways.
                Mark and Steve were going to the Albania v Romania game in Lyon and had arranged
                to meet Fred and Steve in the old town. Roz and I headed of to Part-Dieu station
                as I needed to pick up my tickets for Tuesday's journey home. I had booked them
                before leaving home but needed to collect them from the station.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It took us an hour to walk to the station stopping to look
                at sights and taking photos of fans heading to the game. At the station I was
                initially told that I could have problems picking up my tickets as I have lost
                the credit card that I used to buy them. However, after a twenty minute wait in
                the ticket office, I was given the tickets without having to show any id at all.
                We picked up the tickets for tomorrow from a machine while we were there and
                then headed back towards the old town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had not planned to meet the others but after a few
                minutes of walking round the old town, Fred spotted us so we joined them all for
                a beer before they headed off to the football. After they had left, we had a
                beer in another bar and then went for an excellent Italian meal. The France v
                Switzerland game started while we were in there. We saw about 25 minutes of the
                game and then started to walk back towards the area where we were staying. We
                found a very good pub to watch the second half. It had a good range of beers and
                was the first place we have been to where the French seemed enthusiastic about
                the football. The pub was packed and had the sort of atmosphere you would expect
                if you were in a pub at home. We walked back to the apartment when the game
                finished and had another drink while waiting for Mark and Steve to return.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 20th June - Slovakia v England
                </span>We had been getting a bit more optimistic about England's chances after
                the Wales game but our optimism was knocked on the head when we woke to find
                that Hodgson was likely to make six changes to the team and was going to play
                Henderson and Wilshire in midfield tonight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment and then
                headed out for the day just after 11:30. We spent an hour walking back to
                Part-Dieu station where we were due to catch the 12:54 train to Saint-Etienne.
                There was an earlier train waiting on the platform when we got there so we ran
                to get on it but it was delayed and did not leave until 12:54 anyway. We got
                into Saint-Etienne at about 1:45.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from the station to the centre of the city. The
                whole place seemed far more into the tournament than other places we have been
                to with flags and banners everywhere. The atmosphere was pretty good everywhere
                with fans from both countries mixing with no problems. The weather had improved
                today and it was quite warm walking around. We stopped for a much needed beer in
                a small bar before walking out to the main square where Steve had arranged to
                meet friends.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-013.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The atmosphere in the square was also good. It was packed
                with fans and again, everyone was mixing without problems. These areas are not
                normally the sort of place that me, Roz and Mark have any interest in staying in
                but the atmosphere was OK and we stayed for another beer before heading off to
                get something to eat. We ate at a pizza place on the square and were joined in
                there by Fred and Steve. After eating, Steve stayed in the square with Jer, etc
                while the rest of us started walking North in the direction of the ground. We
                found another bar which was not great but had cheap beer that we could drink
                while sat at the tram stop just outside. We stayed there a couple of hours
                before walking the rest of the distance to the ground.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Getting into the ground was not quite as smooth as at the
                first two games but we were still inside after about 25 minutes and were in our
                seats about half an hour before kick-off. Up until this point, the day had been
                excellent but the rumours about the team were correct and the game was
                disappointing. At least we are through but will have a lot more travelling to do
                in the next week or so than if we had won the group.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the game we walked back to the station where things
                were slightly more organised than in Lens. We got a train by 12:15 and were back
                in Lyon just after 1am. After walking away from the station for about 5 minutes,
                we got a taxi back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We then spent an hour or so making plans for the next week
                or so. Winning the group would have made things very easy for me as I have a
                train ticket into Paris on Friday night. I will now get a TGV down to Avignon on
                Saturday morning where I will meet up with Roz and Mark again (hopefully with my
                car!). We will then drive to Nice on Sunday for the game on Monday. Steve is not
                sure what he will do yet. We finally got to bed at 3ish.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st June
                </span>I was up by 8 as I was booked on the 11:00 train to Lille. We went out to
                get bread for breakfast and after eating, I said goodbye to everyone and started
                my journey home. I started to walk towards the station (after checking that the
                car was still where I had left it) but got as far as Hotel de Ville before
                getting on a bus. I bought food for the journey from the shopping centre and was
                at the station about 45 minutes before departure. The train to Lille which was
                predictably packed with England fans left a few minutes late at 11:05
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a fairly subdued train journey to Lille. I was not
                the only one disappointed by last nights result and totally knackered after not
                enough sleep and too much beer over the last 10 days or so. We arrived in Lille
                at 14:30 so had just over an hour to wait for the 15:36 Eurostar back to London.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The train to London was also on time and arrived just
                after 16:00. I got the tube across to Waterloo and after buying a new railcard,
                got the 16:39 back to Basingstoke. I had an hour wait for Louise to get back
                from London to get a lift home and was back in Kingsclere just before 7:00.</p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 24th June
                </span>Not a great start to the second part of my trip! After three days back in
                the office, I had booked a taxi for 16:05 so I could catch the 16:20 from
                Thatcham. It had not turned up by 16:12 and after phoning the taxi company, I
                was told it had been there but had left again. It had not been there but there
                was not a lot of point in arguing. I walked down to the bus stop on the A4 and
                waited for the 4:30 bus which would have meant I would have caught the 16:57 but
                the bus also failed to turn up. This meant a hot walk/jog of about 2.5 miles and
                I eventually got the 17:19 train. I did have an hour to spare but was not
                expecting it to be used up so early in the journey!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-014.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Things did get better after that. I got a quick connection
                in Reading and managed to get into Paddington at 18:15. I was in St Pancras by
                about 18:40, had time to buy my beer for the journey (four bottles max) and have
                a much needed pint in the Betjemen Arms. I checked in by 19:15 for the 20:01
                train to be told that there was a 30 minute delay. I had a beer at the bar and
                drank one of my bottles while waiting. I had expected a lot of fans to be on the
                train as Wales play N. Ireland in Paris tomorrow. There were a few around but
                not that many.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The train eventually left at about 20:20 and arrived in
                Paris 35 minutes late just after mid-night. I checked into the Mercure right
                opposite the station that I had booked on the way home from Lyon. After dropping
                my bags in the room I went for a walk around the area outside the hotel but did
                not see any bar I fancied a drink in so called it a day.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 25th June
                </span>Today's journey did not start off too badly. I was awake before 7:00 and
                checked out of the hotel by about 7:20. It was only about a ten minute journey
                on the RER to get to Gare du Lyon and I arrived there with plenty of time to get
                the 8:37 down to Avignon where I was meeting Roz and Mark again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I bought breakfast at the station and got on the train
                which departed a few minutes late at about 8:45. The train was already running
                late due to having to detour round an area affected by storms last night but at
                10:45 it stopped completely. The lights and air-con went out and after a while
                we were told that there was a problem with the electricity. After about an hour,
                everyone was allowed off the train and we all spent another hour or so stood by
                the side of the tracks. This was not as bad as being on the train as it was
                cooler and people were quite chatty about the football and Brexit. We were told
                that the electric had failed completely and we would have to wait for another
                train to come and push us 5km to Macon. In total we were stationary for 2hrs 40
                mins before the other train turned up and we could start moving again.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We got to Macon at just after 1:30 - 4 hrs 20 minutes
                behind schedule! We then waited about 50 minutes for the train to be detached.
                We had another 30 minute delay at Lyon while they handed out emergency tuna
                salads, water and colouring books. Although keen to get moving again, this was
                needed as my food and drink had long since run out. We eventually pulled into
                Avignon TGV and about 4:40, 5 hours 20 minutes late. I got another train for the
                five minute journey into the centre where I arrived just after 5:00.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">I had a ten minute walk to Place du Change where Roz and
                Mark were already watching the first game of the day in a bar. We stayed in
                there drinking Paulaner for the Wales v Northern Ireland game and were joined in
                there by Steve whose train was only delayed by just over an hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had planned to go back to the apartment at the end of
                the game but the barman bought us a round of drinks as we were about to leave.
                This was to prove to have quite an effect on the rest of the evening. Instead of
                an hours break from the drinking, we carried on into the next game. We went to
                another couple of bars during the first half and then found a pizza restaurant
                for the second half. We were already fairly pissed when we went into the
                restaurant but managed to get through three litres of wine before we left. We
                then went to another bar (something I have no recollection of) before staggering
                back to the apartment in quite a mess at about 2am.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 26th June
                </span>We were up by about 10:00 and left the apartment by 11:00. We had a two
                hour drive to Nice where we play our next game and managed to find our hotel
                without too many problems. We were all feeling either hung-over or knackered by
                the time we arrived and there was not a lot of enthusiasm for going out to watch
                France v Ireland at 3:00. Instead, we watched the game in our rooms although I
                slept through a lot of it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We met up in reception at 5:30 and walked into Nice old
                town which is a couple of miles away. We had an excellent meal in a Turkish
                restaurant while watching the first half of the Germany v Slovakia game and then
                went to a bar for the second half. By this time we were all flagging again and
                no-one was interested in staying out drinking any more. We went for a walk down
                to the sea front and then got the tram back to our hotel for an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I started watching the Belgium v Hungary game but
                could not stay awake so turned the TV off at half time.

                </span>The worst performance we have ever seen from England!!!!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The day did not start off too badly. We had breakfast on
                the balcony of our room and gave Mark his birthday present. The four of us
                headed towards the old town just after 11:00. We stopped at the VEP (Voucher
                Exchange Point) which was on the way about 15 minutes' walk from where we are
                staying. Collecting the tickets was surprisingly painless and we were on our way
                again after about five minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got to the old town and headed to the port area. We
                wandered round the port for a while and then found a bar/restaurant overlooking
                the port on the edge of the old town. We decided it was time for a beer and
                ended up eating there as well. It was a nice location with cool breezes coming
                off the sea and was a very pleasant spot for a couple of hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left there and continued walking round the sea front to
                the Promenade Anglais. We spent a bit of time there before cutting back into the
                old town again. We wandered round there looking for bars but most places were
                either closed or quite restauranty. We found one place for a quick drink but
                then started walking towards the station. Mark and Steve wanted to pick up train
                tickets from there and that was also the departure point for the shuttles buses.
                We had hoped to find somewhere for a drink on the way but did not really find
                anything suitable. We ended up spending a couple of hours in a bar opposite the
                station which was OK. It was air conditioned, had Belgium beer and although
                crowded, the service was good. A bit overpriced but the best we could find.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-018.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had heard a lot of people saying that getting to and
                from the ground was a bit of a nightmare. The ground is 10km out of town with no
                public transport apart from shuttle buses from the station. Despite the kick-off
                not being until 9:00, we left the bar at 6:40 and walked across the road to
                where the buses departed. The queues for the buses were not too bad and the
                journey only took about half an hour. The buses dropped everyone about 2km from
                the ground so we had a 30 - 40 minute walk before we started on security checks.
                Because we were there earlier than usual, getting in was quite easy and we were
                in our seats about an hour before kick-off.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Enough has already been written about the game but it
                really was abysmal. England were totally shit and deserved to get beaten. By far
                the worst performance any of us have ever seen from an England side that should
                have won easily. It was a terrible way to go out of the tournament and something
                that none of us had expected.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We got out of the ground as soon as possible after the
                game and although there was a lack of organisation at the bus queues, we were on
                a bus fairly quickly and back in Nice before midnight. We had a walk of a couple
                of miles to get back to the hotel and stopped for a final beer on the way. None
                of us could really believe what we had just seen. Mark had already decided that
                this would be his last tournament and that he is "retiring" from international
                football. After what we had seen tonight and with all the hassle involved in
                following England, the rest of us were just about in agreement.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 28th June
                </span>Awake by 9ish after not a great night's sleep. What happened still seems
                incredible but anyway, time to start planning the rest of the week. We now do
                not need to worry about trips to Paris, where to leave the car or how we are all
                going to get time off work for the semi-final. Instead, Roz and I booked a ferry
                home for next Sunday and started to look for places to stay on the way back.
                Steve had already left by the time we got up as he was on the train back to
                London. Roz and I checked out of our room at 11:00 and moved down to Mark's
                room. This is bigger and is fine for the three of us for one night. Mark goes
                home tomorrow.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-019.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We headed back into town after breakfast on the balcony
                again. We walked back to the old town and this time walked up the hill that
                separates the port and the main beach for the views of the area. It was a very
                hot walk in the middle of the day but the views were good and it was worth the
                effort. We got the lift back down and walked back into the old town. We wandered
                round the old town for a bit and went into the biggest of the churches which was
                quite good inside.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was lunchtime by the time we left the church. The local
                specialities of this area are tapas type snacks. We went to Rene Socca, a
                restaurant that was recommended in Lonely Planet on the edge of the old town. It
                was a superb place with a food stall on one side of the seating area and a bar
                on the other. We had a selection of the dishes with a beer each and it was a
                very enjoyable lunch. After eating we had the choice of carrying on drinking or
                going back to the hotel for an afternoon nap. We decided the sleep would be
                better for us and walked back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After a couple of hours back at the hotel, we walked into
                the old town again. We had a beer on the way and then ended up at an Italian
                restaurant near where we had eaten two nights ago. We had an excellent evening
                there. Relatively cheap wheat beer, good wine and the best pizza I have had on
                this trip. The whole place closed around us as we finished our third jug of wine
                and we walked back to our hotel at around midnight.

                </span>We had breakfast included in the room price last night and all went down
                at 8ish. Mark left at 8:30 to get the train home. Quite a sad moment. Even if we
                do carry on going to watch England, this will almost certainly be Mark's and
                possibly Steve's last trip. We met Mark and Steve on our first away trip to
                Bratislava in 2002 and have been together for almost every away game and
                tournament since. The end of an era!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Roz and I went out to the supermarket to buy a few things
                for the next couple of days then checked out and drove a couple of hours to
                Arles where we will stay the next two nights. The hotel in Arles was very close
                to the motorway so easy to find. We parked the car by about midday but were told
                we could not check in until 3:00. Apart from going out to buy bread for lunch,
                we spent the next few hours by the pool until we could check in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into the centre of Arles at about 5:30. We went
                for a few beers in a bar just of the main square and then went back to the
                square for an excellent meal. It was a very nice location and a very enjoyable
                meal. We stopped for another beer on the way home but everything had shut down
                by 11:00 so we returned to the hotel and had a couple of drinks in the room.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 30th June
                </span>A day of doing very little before we start heading North tomorrow. We had
                breakfast in the room and spent the rest of the morning either in the room or by
                the pool. We walked into the centre of Arles at lunchtime and walked round a few
                of the sites. We walked round the Roman amphitheatre but neither of was were
                interested enough to pay €8 to go inside it. We got baguettes for lunch and ate
                them in a square in front of a monastery type building. The rest of the
                afternoon was spent by the pool again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We returned to the main square in the evening. We had a
                couple of drinks in the last bar we had been in last night and then ate in the
                same pizza restaurant that we had eaten in yesterday. This was about the only
                place on the square that did not have a television but we were able to watch the
                first quarter final on the TV of the bar next door. We had a couple of litres of
                wine with our meal and then moved to the bar with the tele for a couple more
                drinks during extra time. Walked back to the hotel at around midnight slightly
                more sober than last night.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 1st July
                </span>After an hour or so by the pool, we checked out at 11:00 and started the
                400 mile drive to Troyes. The drive was fairly uneventful again. The only delay
                was at Lyon where the traffic was very heavy. While we were stationary, the
                outside air temperature reached 51° c according to the gauge in the car. Apart
                from that it was an unremarkable journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We arrived at our hotel in Troyes just after 18:00 and
                after showers, wandered into the town centre. There were a couple of sights to
                look at, though the town is mainly notable for its half-timbered houses. The bar
                we had been aiming for near the cathedral was being renovated so we walked into
                the old town to find somewhere to watch Wales v Belgium.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found a restaurant where we could sit outside and watch
                the match. It was a good atmosphere there with a few Belgian fans and some other
                England fans supporting Wales. We were both glad that Wales had won although
                seeing what they have achieved made England's pathetic efforts seem even worse
                somehow. Went back after the game feeling more depressed about the football than
                I had been for a few days!

                last place we will stay on this trip. Again, the journey was uneventful. We had
                a picnic stop for breakfast and arrived in Boulogne at about 3:00. We checked
                into the Ibis and went out to look round the town. We are staying right outside
                the ramparts of the old town so did not have far to walk. We had lunch in one of
                the restaurants near the cathedral that dominates that part of town and then
                walked town into the newer centre. All quite pleasant although it was too windy
                to make it as far as the waterfront!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-023.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We went back to the hotel for showers and went back out
                again just before 7:00. We had planned to go back down to the new town but did
                not get that far. We stopped for a drink in the first bar we came to inside the
                ramparts - The Vole Hole. This was the nicest bar we had been in since getting
                to France. It was a small pub and was crowded with about 15 people in it but we
                got seats and the beer was good. We had a few in there and then went for a meal
                in one of the restaurants just down the road from it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The meal was one of the best we have had in France. There
                are not as many tourists in Boulogne now there are no ferries coming here and
                things seem better value than most places we have been. A three course meal was
                €16 each and the starter alone would have been enough to eat. Neither of us
                could eat the full three courses. We returned to The Vole Hole to watch the
                second half of the Germany v Italy game and stayed in there until after the
                penalties. Got back to the hotel sometime around midnight.
