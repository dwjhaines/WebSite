                We left home at 6:30ish and had a 45 minute drive down to Portsmouth. We stopped
                at Tesco to stock up on food for tomorrow's journey and then drove to Port
                Solent Wetherpoons for a curry. We drove to the port and checked in for the
                ferry at about 9pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a relief to be checked in and waiting in the queue
                for the ferry as yesterday's equivelent sailing had been cancelled due to the
                strikes in France. We boarded the ferry by about 10:30, dropped our stuff in our
                cabin and went up to the bar for a drink before going to sleep. Plenty of
                football fans in the bar, mainly Welsh, but no-one was too lively due to the
                long drives ahead tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 10th June</span>
                We were up by 7ish local time and the ferry docked on time at 8:30. It took
                almost an hour to get off the ferry and out of the port area but by about 9:30
                we were on our way for the start of our 600 mile drive towards Marseille.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The journey was not too bad most of the way. It all went
                pretty smoothly until Lyon where we were delayed for about an hour which was
                frustrating but the rest of the journey was fine. We had three stops on the way
                totalling about an hour and the worries about petrol were totally unfounded.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The only time we had any problems with directions was when
                we got lost coming off the main road in Marsaielle but our sat-nav got us back
                to the area where we are staying and we made it to our apartment by about 8:15.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We had exchanged a few texts with the owner of our
                apartment on the way down (all in French) and there had been a lot of confusion
                about our arrival, but Mark had arrived before us and had got the key and was
                waiting when we arrived. It took about 15 minutes to ge the car parked but once
                we had done that, we dumped our bags in the apartment and went straight out to
                watch the opening game of the tournament. We got the metro into the centre of
                Marseille and were sat down in a bar with our first beer about two minutes
                before kick-off.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">We knew there was trouble around the old port area so had
                got off the metro a stop before there and found an ideal bar with only a few
                other people in it. We watched the game in there before getting the metro back
                to the apartment where we were joined by Steve who had flown in to Lyon and been
                given a lift down with friends. We bought a few beers from a local shop and
                stayed up drinking on our balcony until about 3am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th June - Emgland v Russia
                </span>Had a late start to the day as we were not really awake until 11ish. We
                had breakfast on the balcony of the apartment and headed into the centre of
                Marseille at about 12:45. We got the metro into the old port area and spent an
                hour or so wandering round there. The atmosphere was all fairly good at this
                point although it was obvious that there was potential for trouble in the bars
                where a lot of our fans were gathered.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After looking round a few of the sights we decided to get away from the area and
                headed inland to find a bar to watch the Switzerland v Albania game. We stopped
                for a beer with a couple of people we knew from Ukraine and then caught a tram
                back to the bar we had been drinking in last night. We got away from the area
                where most of the trouble was to occur less than an hour before it all started.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After the first game had finshed we got the metro towards the ground and found
                another bar to watch Wales v Slovakia. As we were about to leave here, there was
                more trouble outside as England fans were attacked by Russians and we had a few
                things thrown through the windows. All quite dramatic but no-one in the pub was
                hurt and we were able to leave after a few minutes. There was still trouble
                taking place ahead of us as we walked towards the ground but once through the
                first police check, everything calmed down and we were able to get into the
                ground relatively smoothly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The ground itself was one of the most spectacular we have seen and the
                atmosphere was also superb. The game was good and would have been perfect apart
                from the late equaliser. More trouble from the Russians at the final whistle
                meant that we were keen to get away from the ground as quickly as possible. we
                had planned to go back to the bar where we had watched the Wales game but the
                police had (sensibly) closed all the bars in the area and we decided to go
                straight back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I walked a mile or so back to the Metro line 1 and got a train back to
                Sant Juste. We had a 20 minute wait for Mark and Steve to get back due to
                problems on the metro so waited outside the apartment with a beer and were back
                in by about 12:15. A very good day despite the trouble!

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th June
                </span>Steve was colleced by his mates at about 10:30 and Mark Roz and myself
                left the apartment at 11:15 after the owner had been round to collect the key.
                We said goodbye to Filo (the owners cat that we had been looking after) and
                started driving North. We had a detour to visit the aquaduct at Pont du Gard
                which was quite spectacular and then drove about three hours further to Mâcon.
                We did not really know where we would be staying but this seemed a reasonable
                town for a night. We arrived just before 6pm, checked into the hotel we had
                booked while on the way and then headed out to find a bar to watch the Northern
                Ireland v Poland game.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                A lot of places were closed as it is Sunday but we found a couple of decent bars
                and then a pizza place to watch the Germany v Ukraine match. We got through a
                couple of litres of wine during the game and had a pretty good night in the end.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 13th June
                </span>We left the hotel at 9ish and continued our journey North. We had a four
                hour drive to Reims where we were to meet Regan, Annette, Julie and Anne. We
                stopped at McDonalds for breakfast and had one petrol stop but it was a fairly
                uneventful journey. We arrived in Reims at about 2:30 and found our hotel
                without too many problems. We parked in the underground garage and were in our
                apartment just after 3:00.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-004.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not watch the 3:00 game on our tele as it is only on satellite TV for
                some reason and none of us could be bothered to go out and watch it. Instead, we
                had lunch and then Roz and I went out for a walk around Reims. We headed out to
                the Mumm Champagne Cellars and booked all of us onto a tour of the cellars for
                tomorrow afternoon. We then had a walk around the town centre. The cathedral is
                supposed to be one of the most spectacular in France but the first thing you
                notice about it as you approach is the amount of scaffolding on it. It did not
                look too impressive but we did only have a quick look at it before heading back
                to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back via a street which had plenty of decent looking bars on it. We
                met up with the others back at the apartment and the seven of us all headed out
                just before 6. We returned to the street we had walked along earlier and went to
                Les 3 Brasseurs - The Three Brewers - and settled in for the Sweden v Ireland
                game. It was an excellent bar with a good selection of its own beers. We moved
                to another table to eat after the game and stayed there for the 9:00 game as
                well. We left there after the game having paid about €270 between us. Julie,
                Anne and Annette went back to the hotel at that point while the rest of us went
                to another couple of bars. Vaguely remember getting back to the apartment at
                about 2am. A very good night out!

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th June
                </span>A bit of a late start today due to hangovers. Mark, Roz and I left the
                apartment at about 1:15 and went for another walk around the town. We had a
                closer look at the cathedral which was more impressive close up and particularly
                good inside. There was not really a lot else we wanted to see so we made our way
                from there to the Mumm champagne house where we met the others at 3:30 for the
                start of our tour.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The tour lasted just over an hour and was all quite interesting. Mumm have 25km
                of cellars and produce 8 - 9 million bottles of champagne a year. We were shown
                round a section of the cellars 14m underground where the champagne is stored.
                After wandering round the cellars, we were all given a glass to taste although
                most of us agreed we would rather have a beer!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We all stopped at a bar for a swift beer on the way back into towm. Julie and
                Anne went back to the hotel while the rest of us went directly to The Three
                Brewers for the 6pm game. We stayed in there for another five hours and watched
                both the games there. Julie and Anne rejoined us for the 9:00 game and it was
                another good evening out. We were not as pissed as last night and went straight
                back to the apartment when the second game finished.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 15th June
                </span>The three of us checked out of the apartment at 10:15 after doenloading
                next seasons premier league fixtures. We drove about 150 km to Haute Picardie
                where we dropped Mark at the TGV station. He is going to the Russia v Slovakia
                game with Steve (who came over on this morning's Eurostar) in Lille and this
                station was just about on the way for us.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-006.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to drive straight to Arras from here but as we were driving
                through the Somme area, we decided to stop and visit a couple of the 1st World
                War cemeteries as well as the memorial at Thiepval. The cemeteries were similar
                to the ones in Belgium and the second one in particular was well worth the
                visit. The memorial at Thiepval is something we had not heard about before but
                is the biggest British war memorial in the world and was also well worth
                stopping at. It was evident that preperations are underway for commenmorating
                the 100th aniversary of the start of the Battle of The Somme which is only a
                couple of weeks away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were only about 30 minutes away from Awas when we left
                Thiepval and we found our hotel by about 2:30. There was supposed to be car
                parking near the hotel but the whole car park was sealed off as the England team
                are staying at The Mercure just round the corner. We were deciding where we
                should park when a space became available outside the hotel. This is normally a
                no parking zone but we have a letter on the dashboard from hotel management and
                apparently the police will ignore the restrictions for the next two days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We have a huge room for four people - not ideal but the
                only thing we could get in the area. We were able to get BBC 1 on our tele so
                watched the Russia v Slovakia game in the room. We then went out for a walk and
                managed to co-incide going out with England's arrival at their hotel. We waited
                around to taking photos (mainly of the bus) for a while before wandering round
                the rest of the town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The town centre was very Belgium looking with a couple of
                big squares. There were a few fans getting quite lively in one of them but all
                seemed fairly good natured at this point. We found a good beer shop where we
                bought a few French beers from my book and then returned to the hotel to watch
                the 6pm game. Mark and Steve arrived just after 7. We had a beer during the
                second half and then went out to eat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked round the centre again and eventually chose a
                restaurant on the road between the two squares. We had good meals again while
                watching the France v Albania game and stopped off at another bar on the way
                home. Again, there was no sign of any trouble and English and Welsh fans seemed
                happy drinking together. Got back to the hotel at about 1.</p>

                train tickets to Lens before we all went out for breakfast. The service in the
                last place we had been in last night was painfully slow so we ended up in a
                kebab shop round the corner. Chicken kebab and a bottle of Grimbergen was not
                the healthiest start to the day but was an enjoyable enough meal.

            <p class="diary-text">We had a beer in another couple of bars and were also able
                to see the team departing from their hotel (more bus photos!). We got the 1:23
                train to Lens. This was not as crowded as expected. Although full of both sets
                of fans, it was a long train with plenty of space.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were in Lens by about 1:45. The advertised alcohol ban
                had certainly not ben enforced as the town centre seemed to consist mainly of
                bars serving beer in plastic glasses. We were not really expecting to get
                another drink but had time for a pint before walking to the ground. We managed
                to find Regan, Julie and Anne on the way to the ground which was about a 20
                minute walk away. Mark had his wallet stolen on the way to the ground but had
                taken his out so was still able to get in without problems. We got through the
                ticket checks and search areas without any problems and were in the ground with
                about 10 minutes to spare.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-008.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The game itself was one of the best England games we have
                ever seen. A poor first half but an excellent second and winning in injury time
                could not have been much better for us. It puts England top of the group and
                they are now in with a very good chance of winning it. Winning the group would
                be very good as it makes our travel for any later stages a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">No trouble after the game and the walk back to the station
                was fairly straight-forward. Again, both sets of fans were mixing with no
                problems. At the station, things were a bit more chaotic - not because of fans
                but the total incompetance of the police/station authorities. There were not
                enough trains and the solution was to not let anyone into the station. There was
                no queuing system or any form of organisation, just a large group of people
                trying to get through a single narrow entrance. We eventually all got through
                and were on a train before 6 and back in Arras by about 6:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a relatively quiet night back in Arras. We watched
                the Ukraine v Northerrn Ireland game in a bar round the corner from the hotel.
                We then returned to the same restaurant as last night despite saying last night
                we would not go back. The service had been very poor but the food was good, the
                beer good and it was one of the few restaurants we could find with T.V.s. We had
                another good meal before going back to the hotel to watch the highlights of our
                game on BBC1.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 17th June
                </span>We left the hotel just after 10 and drove North to Vimy to visit the
                Canadian WWI memorial and cemeteries. We had an unexpected tour of the frontline
                trenches and spent about 15 minutes in the underground tunnels that they have
                preserved there. All quite interesting again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had an uneventful 500km drive from here to Beaune. We
                had one petrol/toilet/lunch stop after about an hour but did the rest of the
                journey in one go arriving in Beaune just after 5:00, Mark got a ohone call from
                the FA on the way to tell him someone had found his wallet and he should be able
                to pick it up at the next game. Beaune is nice little town less than 100 miles
                from Lyon where we travel to on Sunday so made an ideal place to stay for a
                couple of nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked into the centre of town ffrom the Ibis we are
                staying in and watched the two evening games in a couple of bars. The centre
                looked excellent with plenty of really nice looking wine bars and restaurants.
                Were back in the hotel just after mid-night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 18th June
                </span>We were up quite late again and went over the road to a shopping centre
                for breakfast.For the first time in a while we had heallthy things like
                smoothies and fruit which made a bit of a change. From there, Mark and Steve
                went into town while we went round the supermarket and bought a few things that
                we needed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dropped the stuff we had bought back at the car and
                then walked into town. We spent the best part of an hour waling around the old
                town and looking at a few options for wine tours. It is the nicest place we have
                been since getting to France with plenty of old buildings and it was very
                enjoyable just walking around. We met Mark and Steve at a bar with teles outside
                that was showing the 3pm game.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-010.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After a beer here, Roz and I went off to the Patriarche
                wine cellars. This was the tour that we were keenest on doing and we were not as
                bothered about watching the football as Mark and Steve. They went on a different
                tour when the football finished but the Patriarche cellars closed at 5pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The cellars were excellent and definitely one of the
                highlights of the trip so far. We were shown to the entrance to the cellars but
                were then left to wander round on our own. The cellars themselves were very
                spectacular with all the usual rows of bottles and barrels. The tour included
                tasting 13 different wines, three whites and ten reds. When we got to the first
                tasting room, the whites were out on barrels and we were able to serve
                ourselves. The wine was very nice and we were able to have as many "tastes" as
                we wanted. We eventually left this area and moved onto the reds. Again, there
                was no limit to the amount we could try. The tour cost €17 and was supposed to
                last 60 - 90 minutes. We were down there for about two hours in the end and
                certainly got our moneys worth!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were fairly pissed when we came out of the cellars and
                made our way back to meet Mark and Steve. We stopped for one more drink on the
                way at a bar we had passed a few times and had liked the look of. We watched the
                second half of Iceland v Hungary game in the place we had been to twice last
                night and stayed there to eat and watch Portugal v Austria. We went straight
                back to the hotel when this game finished although the walk back is a bit of a
                vague memory!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 19th June
                </span>A slightly earlier start today. Roz and I walked back into the centre at
                about 9:30 for a last look around, breakfast and some souvenir shopping. We went
                back to the hotel, met up with the others, loaded up the car and left beaune at
                about 11. We filled up with petrol and had a drive of an hour or so to Lyon
                where we will spend the next two nights.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found the apartment easily enough but had a few
                problems finding a parking space. Parking is a big problem in most of France.
                The French seem to be able to get their cars into impossibly small spaces and
                finding somewhere to park a car the size of a Mondeo is not easy. We eventually
                did find somewhere a few minutes away but Roz is concerned as she will be the
                one who has to get it out again on Wednesday after I have gone back to England.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-011.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were met at the apartment by the owners who gave us an
                hours description of how to use the apartment and where to find everything. We
                had an hour or so of sorting ourselves out and left the apartment at 4:00 to go
                into Lyon. We walked down to the river together and then went seperate ways.
                Mark and Steve were going to the Albania v Romania game in Lyon and had arranged
                to meet Fred and Steve in the old town. Roz and I headed of to Part-Dieu station
                as I needed to pick up my ticets for Tuesday's journey home. I had booked them
                before leaving home but needed to collect them from the station.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It took us an hour to walk to the station stopping to look
                at sights and taking photos of fans heading to the game. At the station I was
                initially told that I could have problems picking up my tickets as I have lost
                the credit card that I used to buy them. However, after a twenty minute wait in
                the ticket office, I was given the tickets without having to show any id at all.
                We picked up the tickets for tomorrow from a machine while we were there and
                then headed back towards the old town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had not planned to meet the others but after a few
                minutes of walking round the old town, Fred spotted us so we joined them all for
                a beer before they headed off to the football. After they had left, we had a
                beer in another bar and then went for an excellent Italian meal. The France v
                Switzerland game started while we were in there. We saw about 25 minutes of the
                game and then started to walk back towards the area where we were staying. We
                found a very good pub to watch the second half. It had a good range of beers and
                was the first place we have been to where the French seemed enthusiastic about
                the football. The pub was packed and had the sort of atmosphere you would expect
                if you were in a pub at home. We walked back to the apartment when the game
                finished and had another drink while waiting for Mark and Steve to return.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-012.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 20th June - Slovakia v England
                </span>We had been getting a bit more optimistic about England's chances after
                the Wales game but our optimism was knocked on the head when we woke to find
                that Hodgson was likely to make six changes to the team and was going to play
                Henderson and Wilshire in midfield tonight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I went out to buy breakfast which we ate in the apartment and then
                headed out for the day just after 11:30. We spent an hour walking back to
                Part-Dieu station where we were due to catch the 12:54 train to Saitt-Etienne.
                There was an earlier train waiting on the platform when we got there so we ran
                to get on it but it was delayed and did not leave until 12:54 anyway. We got
                into Saint-Etienne at about 1:45.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We walked from the station to the centre of the city. The
                whole place seemed far more into the tournament than other places we have been
                to with flags and banners everywhere. The atmosphere was pretty good everywhere
                with fans from both countries mixing with no problems. The weather had improved
                today and it was quite warm walking around. We stopped for a much needed beer in
                a small bar beofre walking out to the main square where Steve had arranged to
                meet friends.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/france-013.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The atmosphere in the square was also good. It was packed
                with fans and again, everyone was mixing without problems. These areas are not
                normally the sort of place that me, Roz and Mark have any interest in staying in
                but the atmosphere was OK and we stayed for another beer before heading off to
                get something to eat. We ate at a pizza place on the square and were joined in
                there by Fred and Steve. After eating, Steve stayed in the square with Jer, etc
                while the rest of us started walking North in the direction of the ground. We
                found another bar which was not great but had cheap beer that we could drink
                while sat at he tram stop just outside. We stayed there a couple of hours before
                walking the rest of the distance to the ground.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Getting into the ground was not quite as smooth as at the
                first two games but we were still inside after about 25 minutes and were in our
                seats about half an hour before kick-off. Up until this point, the day had been
                excellent but the rumours about the team were correct and the game was
                disappointing. At least we are through but will have a lot more travelling to do
                in the next week or so than if we had won the group.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After the game we walked back to the station where things
                were slighty more organised than in Lens. We got a a train by 12:15 and were
                back in Lyon just after 1am. After walking away from the station for about 5
                minutes, we got a taxi back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We then spent an hour or so making plans for the next week
                or so. Winning the group would have made things very easy for me as I have a
                train ticket into Paris on Friday night. I will now get a TGV down to Avignon on
                Saturday morning where I will meet up with Roz and Mark again (hopeflly with my
                car!). We will then drive to Nice on Sunday for the game on Monday. Steve is not
                sure what he will do yet. We finally got to bed at 3ish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st June
                </span>I was up by 8 as I was booked on the 11:00 train to Lille. We went out to
                get bread for breakfast and after eatiing, I said goodbye to everyone and
                started my journey home. I started to walk towards the station (after checking
                that the car was still where I had left it) but got as far as Hotel de Ville
                before getting on a bus. I bought food for the journey from the shopping centre
                and was at the station about 45 minutes before departure. The train to Lille
                which was predictably packed with England fans left a few minutes late at 11:05
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a fairly subdued train journey to Lille. I was not
                the only one disappointed by last nights result and totally knackered after not
                enough sleep and too much beer over the last 10 days or so. We arrived in Lille
                at 14:30 so had just over an hour to wait for the 15:36 Eurostar back to London.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The train to London was also on time and arrived just
                after 16:00. I got the tube across to Waterloo and after buying a new railcard,
                got thre 16:39 back to Basingstoke. I had an hour wait for Louise to get back
                from London to get a lift home and was back in Kingsclere just before 7:00.</p>
