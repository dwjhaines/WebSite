                We hardly got any sleep at all as the plane stopped for an hour in Darwin at 5am. We arrived on time in Cairns just before 9 and rang one of the backpackers hostels to come and collect us from the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a list of things to do on arrival in Cairns and set off into the town centre as soon as we had checked in. At the Trailfinders office, we booked ourselves onto a harbour bridge climb for the day we arrive in Sydney. We looked at booking a days diving for Thursday but found information on a three day trip which would qualify us as advance divers. We had thought of doing this sort of trip in The Whitsundays but it made sense to do it before we collect our car. We were not at out most decisive due to lack of sleep but after a visit to the dive centre we decided to go for it. We booked the trip and also booked three days at The Belleview Hotel on The Esplanade for our remining visits to Cairns.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                This change of plan meant that we would be leaving for Kuranda tomorrow so we did not get as drunk as we had planned to but we still went out for a few beers in the evening. It was good to get back on "proper" food again. Since we arrived we had managed to eat a kebab, a pie and fish & chips.

                Woke up with slight hangovers but managed to check out by 8:30 and walk across to the station for the 9:30 scenic railway journey up to Kuranda. The journey took two hours with plenty of photo stops on the way

                Once in Kuranda, we checked into a motel room at The Bottom Pub and then spent an hour or so wandering round the markets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the afternoon asleep and by the time we had got up and had a few glasses of wine, most of Kuranda had shut down for the day. We managed to find an excellent B.Y.O. Italian restuarant and don't really remember getting back to the room.

                Checked out at midday and got the 12:30 bus back to Cairns. We had an hour or so by the pool and spent the remainder of the afternoon shopping. I bought a new rucksack and we both bought masks and snorkels. Roz bought a koala bear called Skippy

                We had booked (and paid for) four nights at a hotel in Port Douglas through Trailfinders before leaving home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by the courtasy coach at 10 and driven up the coast to Port Douglas. The hotel when we got there was one of the best places we had ever stayed. As well as a large bathroom and bedroom, we had a living area with full kitchen, dining table, TV, etc and a large balcony overlooking the sea. It was good to be able to prepare our own food for the first time in three and a half months (mainly consisting of cheese sandwiches but we did cook chilli on Saturday night).
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Port Douglas itself was an excellent place to stay for a few nights. There was not a lot to do there but it had plenty of shops and restaurants as well as three or four pubs so it had everything we needed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got pissed on Friday, mainly drinking a four litre box of wine in the room. We also had a couple of beers in one of the pubs and a couple more with an excellent Mexican meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On Saturday, we had a quiet night in watching The Man with the Golden Gun. Got up in the middle of the night for the football results.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Sunday night was another session. This time we had a few beers in a couple of pubs (as well as a few glasses of wine before leaving the room) and were already well on our way when we got to a B.Y.O. restaurant with another four litre box. Neither of us clearly remember leaving the restaurant but we did stop for another jug of beer on the way home.

                Monday night was the most sober night of our stay - just a few drinks and a return to the Mexican restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During our stay, we did not have a single bad hangover so we could spend our days lying by the pool or wandering round the shops. All in all, it was an excellent four days.

                We were eventually picked up by the shuttle bus at 12:30 and driven back to Cairns. Roz got off at Smithfield to sort out her Medicare card and I checked back into The Belleview Hotel. After watching the Melbourne Cup, we spent the remainder of the afternoon attempting to see a doctor (for Roz's malaria tablets - we eventually got bored of waiting and gave up) and wandering round the shops.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After eating in one of the food halls, we had an early night in preparation for tomorrows diving trip.

                We were picked up from the hotel at 7 and after sorting out the paperwork at the dive shop we were taken by mini-bus to the Cairns pier. We boarded "Reef Quest" which departed at 8.

                On the boat there were five of us doing the advanced diver course including Ossie, the American girl who had been in the room next door to us in Kuta four weeks ago.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did three dives from Reef Quest including one dive towards the course and two fun dives with no instructor or guide. At 2:30 we were transferred to "Ocean Quest" where we were to spend the next 48 hours. Our accomodation was surprisingly good, more spacious than expected and air-conditioned.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did our night dive at about 7:30 and sat around in the saloon area for the rest of the evening.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 2:</span>
                Today we did another four dives - two for the course and two unsupervised fun dives. During the afternoon we also had time to snorkel and saw turtles, a shark and a sting-ray.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Day 3:</span>
                Our first dive of the day , "Underwater Naturalist Dive" and meant that we are now qualified as Advanced Divers. The course had not been anywhere near as intense as the open water course and had mainly consisted of a selection of fun dives with the occasional exercise. Everything was more laid back than on the open water course and no-one was too bothered with things such as knowledge reviews, etc.

                Our second dive was the first in which Roz and I went off totally on our own and after lunch we had our 11th and final dive of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Details of all the dives are in my log book. In general, all the diving was excellent with plenty to see and plenty of new experiances. The trip itself was also very enjoyable - good food, good accomodation and a good crowd of people on the boat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were returned to Cairns at 4:30 and checked back into The Belleview Hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out for a few beers with Jo and Nicky who had been on our course and a few of the others from the boat including some of the instructors.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th November</span>
                We checked out of The Belleview at 10 and were picked up by our hire car company at 11. We were driven to their offices to complet the paperwork and ended up having an argument with one of the rudest people we have ever had to deal with while traveling. We ended up taking the car anyway, although it was tempting to walk away, and by about 11:30 we were on our way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We stopped at Deep Sea Divers Den to get our log books stamped and then started our journey South. We drove as far as Innisfail where we stocked up on food and an esky and then drove another 30 minutes or so for our first picnic lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By about 3:30, we arrived at Mission Beach and checked into a cabin on a caravan park. We booked ourselves onto a white water rafting trip for tomorrow and had a quiet evening with a take-away pizza and had another James Bond film.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th November</span>
                We were picked up by R 'n' R Rafting at 8 and driven to Tully. At Tully we were transferred to a larger bus joining up with people from Cairns and were taken up-river to the starting point for the rafting.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the starting point, we were issued with helmets and life jackets and organised into groups of seven. Our group consisted of us plus another couple from England, an American couple and a Canadian.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a briefing from our instructor, Andy, we headed off down the Tully river. We spent about five hours traveling down 12km of river (including the lunch stop). It was all excellent fun. We managed to go the whole  way without anyone  being thrown into the water (apart from when Andy set us up) but the rapids were all fast enough to make it interesting. It was hard work at times particularly as our boat seemed to get stuck more than some of the others but it was all highly enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After the rafting we were taken back to Tully where we sat in a pub for an hour or so having a few beers with the rest of the people from our raft.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We continued drinking when we gt back to Mission Beach and fell asleep at about 10.

                We did not have too bad hangovers so were up reasonably early and on our way by 8:30. It was approximately 500km to Airlie Beach and the drive took a total of seven hours. It was fairly easy driving although the bad weather made it hard work at times. We stopped at Ayr for lunch (McDonalds) but otherwise did the journey non-stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Airlie Beach, we checked into Reef O's (where Roz and Jane stayed 11 years ago) and booked ourselves onto another three day diving trip. The trip we did from Cairns was supposed to be instead of doing one in The Whitsundays but we had both enjoyed it so much we were keen on another one. Once this was sorted out, we had a few beers in the room and then headed into the main part of Airlie Beach. We had a couple of jugs of beer and then went to a Mexican B.Y.O. restaurant. We had a couple more beers when we got back to Reef O's and don't really remember going to bed.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th November</span>
                It was a cloudy, rainy day so we did not do a lot. We went into Airlie Beach in the morning to pay for our boat trip. and to look around the shops. We spent an hour on the Internet sorting out accomodation for Thailand and also booked ourselves on a Fraser Island trip for next week. We had another trip into Airlie Beach in the afternoon and spent the evening in a similar way to yesterday - the only differance being that we went for a curry instad of a Mexican.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 15th November</span>
                Once again, it was raining for most of the day. We had to move from our double room at 10am as we are staying in a dorm room for the afternoon. We drove out to Conway National Park and walked round a scenic trail for a couple of hours but apart from that, spent most of the day in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 5 we checked out of Reef O's for the second time today (we had used up one of the two free nights that we got for booking our sailing trip) and got the shuttle bus into Airlie. It was by this time raining more heavily and we were beginning to wonder if booking the sailing trip had been a good idea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 6:30, we turned up at the Kelly Dive office and were driven out to Pacific Star. The boat was a 65' catamaran with 20 passengers and 4 crew. We were shown to our cabin which seemed incredibly small but turned out to be perfectly OK. The first evening of the trip mainly involved being told all the safety regulations and being introduced to the crew. The boat left Airlie Beach and headed out to The Whitsundays and moored for the night at Hayman Island.

                The original plan for this trip had been to stay around The Whitsundays for a day and then head to the outer reef for a days diving. Dougie, the boats captain, decided on a change of plan due to the bad weather close to the mainland. This meant a 4am departure from our overnight mooring . We were sleeping at the very front of the boat and once underway I could not sleep and also felt seasick for the first time in my life. By about 5, I had to get up on deck for fresh air. By breakfast time I had fully recovered.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The passengers on the boat consisted of fun divers, divers doing advanced courses, snorkelers and a few people doing introductory dives. We had paid for six dives and did three of them today on the outer reef. The weather was OK for most of the day so we could sun-bathe on the deck when we were not in the water.
