                We hardly got any sleep at all as the plane stopped for an hour in Darwin at 5am. We arrived on time in Cairns just before 9 and rang one of the backpackers hostels to come and collect us from the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a list of things to do on arrival in Cairns and set off into the town centre as soon as we had checked in. At the Trailfinders office, we booked ourselves onto a harbour bridge climb for the day we arrive in Sydney. We looked at booking a days diving for Thursday but found information on a three day trip which would qualify us as advance divers. We had thought of doing this sort of trip in The Whitsundays but it made sense to do it before we collect our car. We were not at out most decisive due to lack of sleep but after a visit to the dive centre we decided to go for it. We booked the trip and also booked three days at The Belleview Hotel on The Esplanade for our remaining visits to Cairns.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                This change of plan meant that we would be leaving for Kuranda tomorrow so we did not get as drunk as we had planned to but we still went out for a few beers in the evening. It was good to get back on "proper" food again. Since we arrived we had managed to eat a kebab, a pie and fish & chips.

                Woke up with slight hangovers but managed to check out by 8:30 and walk across to the station for the 9:30 scenic railway journey up to Kuranda. The journey took two hours with plenty of photo stops on the way

                Once in Kuranda, we checked into a motel room at The Bottom Pub and then spent an hour or so wandering round the markets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the afternoon asleep and by the time we had got up and had a few glasses of wine, most of Kuranda had shut down for the day. We managed to find an excellent B.Y.O. Italian restaurant and don't really remember getting back to the room.

                Checked out at midday and got the 12:30 bus back to Cairns. We had an hour or so by the pool and spent the remainder of the afternoon shopping. I bought a new rucksack and we both bought masks and snorkels. Roz bought a koala bear called Skippy

                We had booked (and paid for) four nights at a hotel in Port Douglas through Trailfinders before leaving home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by the courtesy coach at 10 and driven up the coast to Port Douglas. The hotel when we got there was one of the best places we had ever stayed. As well as a large bathroom and bedroom, we had a living area with full kitchen, dining table, TV, etc and a large balcony overlooking the sea. It was good to be able to prepare our own food for the first time in three and a half months (mainly consisting of cheese sandwiches but we did cook chilli on Saturday night).

            <p class="diary-text">
                Port Douglas itself was an excellent place to stay for a few nights. There was not a lot to do there but it had plenty of shops and restaurants as well as three or four pubs so it had everything we needed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got pissed on Friday, mainly drinking a four litre box of wine in the room. We also had a couple of beers in one of the pubs and a couple more with an excellent Mexican meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On Saturday, we had a quiet night in watching The Man with the Golden Gun. Got up in the middle of the night for the football results.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Sunday night was another session. This time we had a few beers in a couple of pubs (as well as a few glasses of wine before leaving the room) and were already well on our way when we got to a B.Y.O. restaurant with another four litre box. Neither of us clearly remember leaving the restaurant but we did stop for another jug of beer on the way home.

                Monday night was the most sober night of our stay - just a few drinks and a return to the Mexican restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During our stay, we did not have a single bad hangover so we could spend our days lying by the pool or wandering round the shops. All in all, it was an excellent four days.

                We were eventually picked up by the shuttle bus at 12:30 and driven back to Cairns. Roz got off at Smithfield to sort out her Medicare card and I checked back into The Belleview Hotel. After watching the Melbourne Cup, we spent the remainder of the afternoon attempting to see a doctor (for Roz's malaria tablets - we eventually got bored of waiting and gave up) and wandering round the shops.

                After eating in one of the food halls, we had an early night in preparation for tomorrows diving trip.

                We were picked up from the hotel at 7 and after sorting out the paperwork at the dive shop we were taken by mini-bus to the Cairns pier. We boarded "Reef Quest" which departed at 8.

                On the boat there were five of us doing the advanced diver course including Ossie, the American girl who had been in the room next door to us in Kuta four weeks ago.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did three dives from Reef Quest including one dive towards the course and two fun dives with no instructor or guide. At 2:30 we were transferred to "Ocean Quest" where we were to spend the next 48 hours. Our accommodation was surprisingly good, more spacious than expected and air-conditioned.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did our night dive at about 7:30 and sat around in the saloon area for the rest of the evening.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 2:</span>
                Today we did another four dives - two for the course and two unsupervised fun dives. During the afternoon we also had time to snorkel and saw turtles, a shark and a sting-ray.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 3:</span>
                Our first dive of the day , "Underwater Naturalist Dive" and meant that we are now qualified as Advanced Divers. The course had not been anywhere near as intense as the open water course and had mainly consisted of a selection of fun dives with the occasional exercise. Everything was more laid back than on the open water course and no-one was too bothered with things such as knowledge reviews, etc.

                Our second dive was the first in which Roz and I went off totally on our own and after lunch we had our 11th and final dive of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Details of all the dives are in my log book. In general, all the diving was excellent with plenty to see and plenty of new experiances. The trip itself was also very enjoyable - good food, good accommodation and a good crowd of people on the boat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were returned to Cairns at 4:30 and checked back into The Belleview Hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out for a few beers with Jo and Nicky who had been on our course and a few of the others from the boat including some of the instructors.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 11th November</span>
                We checked out of The Belleview at 10 and were picked up by our hire car company at 11. We were driven to their offices to complete the paperwork and ended up having an argument with one of the rudest people we have ever had to deal with while traveling. We ended up taking the car anyway, although it was tempting to walk away, and by about 11:30 we were on our way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We stopped at Deep Sea Divers Den to get our log books stamped and then started our journey South. We drove as far as Innisfail where we stocked up on food and an esky and then drove another 30 minutes or so for our first picnic lunch.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By about 3:30, we arrived at Mission Beach and checked into a cabin on a caravan park. We booked ourselves onto a white water rafting trip for tomorrow and had a quiet evening with a take-away pizza and had another James Bond film.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 12th November</span>
                We were picked up by R 'n' R Rafting at 8 and driven to Tully. At Tully we were transferred to a larger bus joining up with people from Cairns and were taken up-river to the starting point for the rafting.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the starting point, we were issued with helmets and life jackets and organised into groups of seven. Our group consisted of us plus another couple from England, an American couple and a Canadian.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a briefing from our instructor, Andy, we headed off down the Tully river. We spent about five hours traveling down 12km of river (including the lunch stop). It was all excellent fun. We managed to go the whole  way without anyone  being thrown into the water (apart from when Andy set us up) but the rapids were all fast enough to make it interesting. It was hard work at times particularly as our boat seemed to get stuck more than some of the others but it was all highly enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After the rafting we were taken back to Tully where we sat in a pub for an hour or so having a few beers with the rest of the people from our raft.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We continued drinking when we gt back to Mission Beach and fell asleep at about 10.

                We did not have too bad hangovers so were up reasonably early and on our way by 8:30. It was approximately 500km to Airlie Beach and the drive took a total of seven hours. It was fairly easy driving although the bad weather made it hard work at times. We stopped at Ayr for lunch (McDonalds) but otherwise did the journey non-stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Airlie Beach, we checked into Reef O's (where Roz and Jane stayed 11 years ago) and booked ourselves onto another three day diving trip. The trip we did from Cairns was supposed to be instead of doing one in The Whitsundays but we had both enjoyed it so much we were keen on another one. Once this was sorted out, we had a few beers in the room and then headed into the main part of Airlie Beach. We had a couple of jugs of beer and then went to a Mexican B.Y.O. restaurant. We had a couple more beers when we got back to Reef O's and don't really remember going to bed.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 14th November</span>
                It was a cloudy, rainy day so we did not do a lot. We went into Airlie Beach in the morning to pay for our boat trip. and to look around the shops. We spent an hour on the Internet sorting out accommodation for Thailand and also booked ourselves on a Fraser Island trip for next week. We had another trip into Airlie Beach in the afternoon and spent the evening in a similar way to yesterday - the only difference being that we went for a curry instad of a Mexican.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 15th November</span>
                Once again, it was raining for most of the day. We had to move from our double room at 10am as we are staying in a dorm room for the afternoon. We drove out to Conway National Park and walked round a scenic trail for a couple of hours but apart from that, spent most of the day in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 5 we checked out of Reef O's for the second time today (we had used up one of the two free nights that we got for booking our sailing trip) and got the shuttle bus into Airlie. It was by this time raining more heavily and we were beginning to wonder if booking the sailing trip had been a good idea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 6:30, we turned up at the Kelly Dive office and were driven out to Pacific Star. The boat was a 65' catamaran with 20 passengers and 4 crew. We were shown to our cabin which seemed incredibly small but turned out to be perfectly OK. The first evening of the trip mainly involved being told all the safety regulations and being introduced to the crew. The boat left Airlie Beach and headed out to The Whitsundays and moored for the night at Hayman Island.

                The original plan for this trip had been to stay around The Whitsundays for a day and then head to the outer reef for a days diving. Dougie, the boats captain, decided on a change of plan due to the bad weather close to the mainland. This meant a 4am departure from our overnight mooring . We were sleeping at the very front of the boat and once underway I could not sleep and also felt seasick for the first time in my life. By about 5, I had to get up on deck for fresh air. By breakfast time I had fully recovered.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The passengers on the boat consisted of fun divers, divers doing advanced courses, snorkelers and a few people doing introductory dives. We had paid for six dives and did three of them today on the outer reef. The weather was OK for most of the day so we could sun-bathe on the deck when we were not in the water.

                We had stayed on the outer reef overnight and did our first dive of the day before the boat moved off. After the first dive we left the reef and headed back to Hayman Island. The weather by now was terrible and people were starting to get fed up. For those who were not diving, there was not a lot to do. A lot of people were feeling ill and just staying in their cabins.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we got to Hayman Island, we were tempted not to bother with the dives due to the weather. In the end, we did them and they turned out better than expected. It seemes warmer under the water, visibility was OK and there was plenty to see. For us at least, it had been a good day despite the weather.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a fairly rough journey to the nights mooring point which again saw most people lying in their cabins.

We got to the beach at 8ish and were taken ashore at about 8:30. We had a couple of hours on the beach and were again lucky with the weather. It was fairly sunny on the beach and we stayed there for a couple of hours. By 11 we were on our way back to Airlie Beach where we arrived at about 3:30. The journey back was quite enjoyable, again with good weather. Spent most of the journey getting sun-burnt on the deck.

                The whole trip had worked out better than we could have hoped for when we were getting on the boat on Wednesday. We were very lucky with the weather and when the weather was bad, the diving was still good. The trip was also made good by the group of people on board. Just about everyone got on well with everyone else and there was a really good atmosphere the whole time. The food was excellent - three meals a day plus plenty of snacks to keep us going in between.

                Back on land again, we were returned to Reef O's and were put in a four bed dorm with two blokes who did not like each other which was not ideal. However, we were only in the room for a couple of hours before we headed into Airlie again. We had a Mexican meal and then went to Magnums to meet up with everyone from the boat trip. Just about everyone turned up (apart from those who were traveling straight away) and it was a really good evening. We stayed until 12 but managed not to get too pissed. Got back to the dorm at about 12:15.

                Got up at 6:45 and left the room (without waking our two room-mates) by 7. We left Reef O's after breakfast and drove to Eungella National Park. The journey took about three hours and on the way, we saw our first live kangaroo of the visit.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not check into our room immedeatly so we went for a quick walk to the platypus viewing area (Eungella's main attraction) and also saw our first platypus. We checked into our room by 11:30 and after sorting out our stuff and having lunch, we decided to head off on one of the park's rain-forest walks. We chose one that should have been about 8km and set off at about 12:45. The walk was quite good but gave us our first ever experience of leaches. Every time we stopped, our boots and socks became covered in the things. None of them got through to the skin but we were constantly having to stop and remove them. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After about 7km of the walk we came to a point where we had to cross a river. Due to the amount of rain that had fallen recently, crossing the river was totally impossible. This meant we had to walk all the way back so it turned into a 14km walk. By the time we were back at the hotel, we were both soaked and knackered.

                We walked back over to the viewing point and this time saw loads of platypuses and a turtle. We had also seem kookaburras and another kangaroo at the hotel. Our wildlife viewing continued during our evening meal when we watched a group of possums having their nightly feed. We started watching a film back in the room but fell asleep before the end.

                We were up before 6 to begin our drive to Bundaberg. This was probably to be the longest days driving we would do. We had a few stops along the way for meals and to stock up on supplies in Rockhampton. The journey was no too bad and we got into Bundaberg just before 4. We headed directly out to Mon Repos Beach where there is a turtle rookery. We wanted to find details of when the turtles come to lay their eggs. There was no-one there to ask but it appears that we have to come back at 7 and could have a long wait if we are to see anything. We went back to "Bundy" and checked into a motel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a lot of thought, we decided not to bother going out to see the turtles. We were both tired and have an early start tomorrow. We were faced with a long wait and there was no guarantee that we would see turtles anyway. Instead, we got a take-away pizza and watched highlights of the weekends football while drinking a fw beers.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 21st November</span>
                We had booked ourselves on a trip to Fraser Island for today and had to get down to Hervey Bay Airport by 7:15. This meant leaving Bundy at 5:45 so it was another early start. We arrived at the airport with about ten minutes to spare and, after filling out the paperwork and watching the safety videos we were taken out to hte plane.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip included return flights to Fraser Island plus a 4-wheel drive vehicle for the duration of our visit and it had seemed excellent value at about £40 each.

                The plane took five passengers and the trip out to the island took a very enjoyable 15 minutes. We landed on the beach at about 8:30 and were given the keeys to our Suzuki Jimmy.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As the tide was out, we spent the morning driving about 40km up the beach and returning stopping at Eli Creek, the Maheno wreck and The Pinnacles along the way. We then headed inland on some of the 4WD tracks intending to visit Lake Wabby and Lake McKenzie. We successfully found the look-out point for Lake Wabby but due to an unexpected one-way system, failed to make it to Lake McKenzie. We stopped for lunch at the place where Roz got her 4WD stuck 11 years ago and got our vehicle back to the starting point by 2:45.

                Our flight back to Hervey Bay was at 3 and this was excellent. The pilot took his time going back, pointing out the sights and we did get to see Lake McKenzie. The whole day had been brilliant. The driving was all quite enjoyable and the flights excellent. It was definitely worth the money.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at our car by 3:30 and had a couple of hours drive down to Tin Can Bay where we checked into a motel for the night.

                Woke up at 7:15 and headed straight out to the boat pier where wild dolphins come in every morning to be fed. It was very similar to monkey Mia in W.A. Two dolphins were there and we both bought tins of fish to hand feed them.

                We spent about an hour watching the dolphins before returning to the hotel for breakfast. We left Tin Can Bay at about 9:30 and drove straight to Noosa where we checked into a motel apartment. It was quite nice having nothing to do for the first time since Airlie Beach. We wandered round the shops, lay by the pool and drove down for a look at the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we had a couple of beers in the room, went round a couple of bars and then went for a B.Y.O. pizza. We had a few more drinks after the meal and were fairly pissed by the end of the evening.

                We had planned to stay in Noosa for a second night but when we woke up it was raining again an our hangovers were not too bad so we decided to move on. We started driving South from Noosa at about 10:30. We stopped at The Big Pineapple where we somehow managed to spend an hour and then drove down to The Forest Glen Deer Sanctuary. We did not go into the sanctuary but just outside was a koala viewing area. We spent about an hour here as well and both had our photos taken "cuddling a koala".

                We drove just about non-stop from here, past Brisbane and down to The Gold Coast. We eventually found a motel at Surfer's Paradise and after checking in, spent an hour or so on the beach.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to go round a few pubs in the evening but did not seem to be able to find any. There were plenty of bars and night-clubs but no normal pubs. WE ended up having a few beers in the "Search and Rescue Club" and The RSL and then returned to the room. The evenings entertainment was provided by the thousands of 17 year olds in Surfer's for "Schoolies Week".

                We left Surfer's at 9ish and drove straight down to Byron Bay. The drive was a couple of hours and due to a one hour time difference, we arrived at about midday. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We wanted to stay in Byron Bay for two nights but for the first time since getting to Australia, we had a problem finding accommodation. Most of the motels were full but we eventually found a place that had a vacancy for one night only. We decided to take the room and continue heading towards Sydney tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the remainder of the afternoon lying on the beach or by the motel swimming pool. We had a few beers by the pool and went out for another B.Y.O. pizza. Ended the evening by going to a couple of pubs.

                We were woken at 8 with a phone call telling us that the motel had received a cancellation and we were able to stay a second night. Our hangovers were not too bad so we spent a couple of hours on the beach before lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got a take-away kebab and returned to the room to watch a James Bond film. Once again, we got fed up with the ads and gave up before the end.

We checked into a motel near to where we stayed last time we were here and spent the remainder of the afternoon lying by the pool.

                We had planned to stay in Manley for the night but could not find any accommodation there. We did not really know which direction to head from Manley but ended up in the city centre having driven over the harbour bridge. We tried to get a room at The Oxford Koala where we had stayed six years ago but ended up at The Cambridge Park Inn just round the corner. We had a room booked here from tomorrow so we checked in one night early.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a walk around the city centre which turned into a search for the post office that was holding our poste restante mail. We collected our letters and walked back to the hotel.

                As it was the last day we had the car, we drove out to Bondi for tea. We walked around the area we used to live in around the main area of pubs and shops. 68 O'Donnell St seemed to have deteriorated a bit and all looked a bit sad and the back and side bars of The Bondi Hotel had been modernised, but apart from that, everything was pretty much the same.

                We had take-aways from Mr Yeeros and then drove back to Paddington. We thought that our pizza place had disappeared but eventually found it much to our relief. We then drove back to the hotel and had an early, alcohol free night in preparation for tomorrow's bridge climb.

                We returned our hire car to the Delta office by 10:30 and walked into Kings Cross. From here, we bought our weekly travel passes and got the train to Circular Quay. We went to the Trailfinders office to find out about flights from Samui to K.L. for next March and then wandered round the shops on the way back to the hotel.

                After lunch, we headed off to the harbour bridge for our "Bridge Climb". The tour started at 3:25 and most of the first hour was spent getting into our overalls and being issued with our equipment. The walk was nothing too difficult but the views along the way were superb. The guide made the walk fairly interesting and the whole thing was very enjoyable.

We got the ferry from Darling Harbour to Circular Quay and went round a few more shops. We had to shelter from the rain again this time in a German Beer Hall.

                Once Roz had recovered we continued the sight-seeing starting with a trip up The Centrepoint Tower. The views of Sydney were excellent but the included "Skytour" was nothing spectacular. We walked from The Centrepoint to Circular Quay and the harbour bridge. This time, we climbed one of the pylons visiting The Harbour Bridge Museum on the way up. Once again, the views were superb and this time, unlike on the bridge climb, we were able to take pictures.

                I got up and went into Sydney to post our souvenirs and collect mail from poste restante. We got a taxi from the hotel to Sydney airport at about 10:30 and our flight left on time at 1pm. The total time to K.L. was about ten and a half hours as we had to fly via Melbourne. The flight gave us our final views of Sydney Harbour and also flew over Ayers Rock and Mt Bromo on Java. We arrived in K.L. on time at 8:30pm and spent about an hour getting through the airport.

                We were both completely knackered by this stage so got a taxi to our hotel. This journey took about 45 minutes.

                We had pre-booked The Shangri-La through Trailfinders and immedeatly lowered the tone as we marched into reception with our rucksacks. This is almost certainly the flashiest hotel we have ever stayed in. After showers we both fell asleep.
