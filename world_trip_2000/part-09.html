                We were up before 6 to begin our journey to Saigon. We walked to Capitol Guest House and got on their mini-bus which departed 30 minutes late at 7:15. Their were 45 of us making the journey on three mini-buses.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were expecting the journey to take 8 - 10 hours but it was clear from early on that it was going to take longer. We had an hour stop at the point where the main road crosses the Mehkong (by ferry) and a further hour delay for an extended lunch stop. The bus was comfortable and the scenery reasonably interesting so it was not too bad a way of spending the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the Vietnamese border at 3:15 and it took just over two hours to get through. We all transferred to another bus and were dropped in Saigon at about 7:30. We were completely knackered and checked into the first hotel we looked at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers we went out for tea and then had a few beers while watching Coventry v Arsenal. The football was not too exciting so we returned to the room to watch England beat Wales in the 6 Nations instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were quite impressed with our first view of Saigon. All the hassle that we had anticipated after reading Lonely Planet did not occur and the main back-packer area is a lot nicer than Khao San Road. There are plenty of pubs/restaurants and shops and everything seems reasonably priced.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 4th February</span>
                After breakfast, we changed hotels. We moved to a bigger, cheaper room and got a discount for being on the sixth floor (no lift!)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got money out from the HSBC bank went out to the railway station to book tickets to Na Trang for Thursday night. After walking back to the back-packer area, we booked ourselves onto a trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, we got two cyclos to take us round some of the sights of Saigon. First stop was at the Reunification Palace. While not overly spectacular, this was a reasonably interesting building to wander around with a different guide on each floor to show you round the rooms. From there we went to the War Remnants Museum which was also pretty interesting with plenty of mainly anti-American pictures and artifacts from "The American War".
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Next was the Jade Emperor Pagoda, a Chinese temple that made quite a change from the wats and temples we have been to recently. Finally, we stopped briefly at The Notre Dame Cathedral. This was the least impressive of the places we visited. Riding round the streets of Saigon in a cyclo was an experience in itself and the whole thing was very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once back at the hotel, we booked ourselves on flights from Na Trang to Danang for 13/2 so all our long distance travel in Vietnam is now arranged and we don't need to get involved with long bus journeys.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 5th February</span>
                The bus trip out to Cu Chi took about two hours (35km). Once there, we were shown a video about the tunnels, again with a very anti-American theme. We were shown a selection of body traps and weapons used by the Viet Con during the war and then went to see the tunnels.

                Some of them were very small and it was only just possible to get in the entrance way - a couple of the others were bigger (and had electric lights) and you could get through on hands and knees. It was all quite interesting again and was worth the slow bus journey.

                We got dropped back in Saigon just after 2. Didn't do a lot for the rest of the day.

                Checked out of our hotel after breakfast as we were moving to The Majestic. We had pre-booked this on the Internet so that we could be in a decent hotel for Roz's birthday. We got a taxi from where we were staying to the Laos Consulate as we needed Laos visas for when we leave Vietnam. The consulate was the most laid back place we had ever been for visas. We only intended getting transit visas which should have cost $25 - instead of tourist visas which cost $50. However, after about 20 minutes of chatting to the man behind the desk, we came away with tourist visas for $30. We don't really know what was going on but we came out of the deal very well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got another taxi to The Majestic Hotel which was everything we had hoped for - massive bedroom, swimming pool, etc. We spent a few hours by the pool before lunch and then I wandered round the shops for an hour while Roz returned to the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we returned to the main back-packer area for tea and also had a few beers. We got a taxi back to the hotel and continued the session with Mehkong and rum.

                Roz's birthday! Had slight hangovers from last night's alcohol. Spent most of the day relaxing by the pool or in the room. For the birthday session we went round a few bars again, went for a pizza and finished off with bottles of rum in the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th February</span>
                We had slight hangovers again but did not have to check out of the hotel until 6pm. This meant that we could spend the whole day at the hotel (apart from a trip to the  HSBC bank again) before getting a taxi to the train station at 5:30. The train station was a lot less hassle that we had expected and we were safely on our train by 6:00. We were in a four berth compartment which was pretty comfortable and we departed on time at 6:40.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th February</span>
                We arrived in Nha Trang just after 6am and walked from the station down to the beach where I stayed with the luggage while Roz found us a hotel. After sleeping for a couple of hours we headed for the beach. The beach was quite nice but the weather was not ideal - lots of cloud and very windy. We started to doubt whether or not we want to stay here until Tuesday which is when we have flights booked for.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch we tried (unsuccessfully) to bring our flights forward a couple of days. We also visited a doctor where Roz discovered she has a stomach inflammation and is off alcohol for at least a week. In the evening, we booked ourselves on an island trip for tomorrow and went for a curry.

                The island trip we went on consisted of a boat trip to four different islands. It was not the best boat trip we have ever been on by a long way but it was a reasonably enjoyable way of spending the day. There was snorkeling at the first two islands (but nothing very spectacular), a beach resort at the third and a fishing village at the last one. The entertainment for the day was provided by our Vietnamese guides singing horrendous versions of English pop songs. The best part of the trip was the food which was excellent. The weather was cloudy and cold for most of the day and it has certainly put us off the idea of diving from Nha Trang.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 11th February</span>
                We made it to the beach just after 11 but again the weather was not too good. The strong winds made it quite unpleasant for sun-bathing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided that staying in Nha Trang was just wasting time so made our minds up to leave early. We returned to the room, packed and checked out of the hotel. We then went to Sinh Cafe where we had to wait until 2 o'clock before finding out from the airline office that we could get refunds for our flights. As soon as we found that we would get refunds, we booked ourselves on the overnight bus to Hoi An. We lost about $10 each on our flights but overall, it seemed the best thing to do. It saves us some money but gives us an extra day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for another pizza and spent most of the remainder of the day sitting around in Sinh Cafe waiting for the bus to leave at 7pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus was pretty uncomfortable for an overnight journey - no leg room and no reclining seats. The conditions of the road made sleep just about impossible. After 11, Roz moved onto the floor which gave me a double seat but I still hardly slept during the 14 hour journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 12th February</span>
                Arrived in Hoi An at 9am completely knackered. We were dropped at a hotel outside the town but decided to walk straight away towards the centre and look for something there. This proved to be a good move as other people from our bus seemed to have problems finding rooms. We went out for breakfast after checking in and then fell asleep for a couple of hours.

                We got up again at 12:30 and headed off to look around Hoi An. We had lunch in a riverside restaurant then spent a few hours wandering round the sights. There was nothing too spectacular to visit but it was a really nice place to wander round. We went to one of the "Assembly Halls", an "Old House", The Japanese Bridge and a "Chinese Pagoda". There were plenty of souvenir shops along the way to break up the sight-seeing so it was all very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for an excellent evening meal consisting of ten courses of assorted Vietnamese food.

                We had booked a half day tour out to Champa Ruins out at Myson and were collected from our hotel at 8am. It took a couple of hours to get there by the time we had picked everyone else up and we were given two hours to look around the site. The ruins were not very impressive and the fact that we were at Angkor a few days ago probably did not help. At the ruins we spoke to someone who had previously gone from Vietnam to Laos using the route we were planning to use on Friday. She said her journey took 30 hours and was a complete nightmare. This was the second such report we have received and we started to have our doubts about the journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Back in Hoi An, we had a similar afternoon to yesterday, walking round the town and looking at souvenirs (particularly gongs!). We booked our tickets to Hue for tomorrow and also started finding information on the trip to Laos. The Thorn Tree backed up what we had been told by other people and the whole thing does not sound much fun (Roz is still suffering from her stomach problem which would not help).

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the remainder of the afternoon planning an alternative route. If we can book the tickets we will probably travel by train to Hanoi and then fly to Vientiane next week. If either of these options is not available, we may revert to the original plan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate in the same place as last night. The food in Hoi An has been superb.

                We were collected from the hotel at 7:45 for the  journey to Hue. The bus trip was supposed to include a few stops on the way. These turned out to be a 45 minute stop at Marble Mountain and over an hour for lunch at a beach. The Marble Mountain stop was quite enjoyable. It was too wet to climb up the mountain but the souvenir shops were excellent. The Hai Van Pass stop was canceled due to the weather which was cold and wet for the whole trip. The trip took a lot longer than it should have done due to the windscreen wipers not working. Various attempts to fix them were unsuccessful and for most of the journey they were being operated manually by the driver and his mate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped in the centre of Hue at 3:30 and went straight to the Sinh Cafe where we were able to book all the tickets we wanted. We will travel by train to Hanoi on Friday and fly to Vientiane on Tuesday. We checked into a hotel, used the Internet for a while and collected out tickets by 5:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We could not be bothered to go out and see anything but had a quick walk around the area where we are staying before our evening meal. Were back in the hotel by 9 and had an early night.

                We were booked onto yet another tour for this morning, this one a boat trip on The Perfume River visiting a couple of pagodas and three of the Royal Burial Tombs.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                First stop was Thien Mu Pagoda which was reasonably interesting and from there we went to the Tomb of Tu Duc. Our tour group walked the mile up to the tomb despite the boat drivers trying to get us all on motorbikes. There was some confusion about which tomb we were actually at but once inside it was all pretty good.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At this point, we decided to abandon the tour and go back to Hue. We had decided that we would only go into one tomb due to high admission fees (£2.75) so it seemed pointless staying on the boat for the next few hours. We were lucky to get a lift back with an Israeli on a moped and were back in Hue just after midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, we crossed the river to The Citadel. Once again, we considered the admission to be too expensive (US$5) so made do with taking pictures of the gates.

                On the way back to the hotel, we stopped at a flashy hotel to try and find a doctor as Roz's stomach problem has not cleared up and the hospital did not look too good. The doctor came round to our hotel and diagnosed "Gastritis". As is usual with doctors in Asia, he prescribed a bag of assorted tablets - 14 a day for five days - including two different antibiotics.

                We were booked on the 3:47 train to Hanoi and did not have a lot to do for most of the day. Apart from a trip out to the bank, we spent the morning in the room. After check-out, we used the Internet for an hour, had lunch and walked out to the station by 3 o'clock.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Surprisingly, the train was only 15 - 20 minutes late getting into Hue and we were on our way by 4:30. We were in a six berth apartment which was no-where near as spacious as the four berth but was still OK for laying down.

                We arrived in Hanoi earlier than expected at 8:30 after a pretty good night's sleep. By 9, we had got a taxi into the old quarter and checked into a hotel.

                After showers, we began our Hanoi sight-seeing. We got  a taxi out to the Ho Chi Min mausoleum and after a bit of a walk, spent about 60 seconds filing past the embalmed body. The two pagodas near the mausoleum were not too exciting so we walked back to the old quarter.

                We wandered round a few travel agents to look at tours for tomorrow and then went for a traditional Hanoi lunch at Cha Ca Restaurant. In the afternoon we booked a tour for tomorrow and a couple of tickets for the water puppets for Monday. We tried without success to find the Vietnam Airways office and HSBC bank (both had moved) and walked back to the hotel.

                At 7 we managed to find a bar showing Sunderland v West Ham live. We stayed there until the end of the game, went for something to eat and then returned to the room to listen to the rest of the football on World Service.

                At 7:30 we started our final Vietnamese tour out to The Perfume Pagoda. We were taken by mini-bus to a town about two hours away from Hanoi. Here we were transferred to a rowing boat for the one hour journey to the Perfume Pagoda complex. The boat trip was excellent. It was really good scenery and hundreds of other boats traveling towards the temple made the whole thing very spectacular.

                At the temple complex we were given lunch and then left to make our own way up to the temple. The walk up the hill was not particularly enjoyable. There were a total of 18,000 people visiting the temple as not only was it the middle of the Spring festival but also a weekend. At times on the walk you could not move due to the number of people going up and down the path. After an hour we gave up and started walking back down (only one of the ten people on our tour made it to the top). We stopped off at a smaller pagoda on the way back down. It was only just off the main route but was far more peaceful with hardly anyone there. There were good views of the surrounding countryside and a surprisingly spectacular cave to visit. There was another pagoda at the foot of the hill which was also pretty spectacular. We had another excellent boat trip back followed by another two hours in the mini-bus. We were back in Hanoi by 7:15.

                We were both worn out by this time. We had showers, went out for an excellent pizza and were back in the hotel by 9:30.

                We had a day in Hanoi with not much to do which was quite nice after all the tours and sight-seeing of recent weeks. We spent a couple of hours wandering round the old quarter on the Lonely Planet walking tour. It was all quite interesting without being overly exciting. In the afternoon we had another trip round the shops for presents/souvenirs.

                We had tickets for the water puppet show at 9:15 and headed for the theater after tea. The show was reasonably entertaining. It was all very cleverly done and quite amusing but one hour of it was probably enough!
