                We were up before 6 to begin our journey to Saigon. We walked to Capitol Guest House and got on their mini-bus which departed 30 minutes late at 7:15. Their were 45 of us making the journey on three mini-buses.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were expecting the journey to take 8 - 10 hours but it was clear from early on that it was going to take longer. We had an hour stop at the point where the main road crosses the Mehkong (by ferry) and a further hour delay for an extended lunch stop. The bus was comfortable and the scenery reasonably interesting so it was not too bad a way of spending the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the Vietnamese border at 3:15 and it took just over two hours to get through. We all transferred to another bus and were dropped in Saigon at about 7:30. We were completely knackered and checked into the first hotel we looked at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers we went out for tea and then had a few beers while watching Coventry v Arsenal. The football was not too exciting so we returned to the room to watch England beat Wales in the 6 Nations instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were quite impressed with our first view of Saigon. All the hassle that we had anticipated after reading Lonely Planet did not occur and the main back-packer area is a lot nicer than Khao San Road. There are plenty of pubs/restaurants and shops and everything seems reasonably priced.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 4th February</span>
                After breakfast, we changed hotels. We moved to a bigger, cheaper room and got a discount for being on the sixth floor (no lift!)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got money out from the HSBC bank went out to the railway station to book tickets to Na Trang for Thursday night. After walking back to the back-packer area, we booked ourselves onto a trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, we got two cyclos to take us round some of the sights of Saigon. First stop was at the Reunification Palace. While not overly spectacular, this was a reasonably interesting building to wander around with a different guide on each floor to show you round the rooms. From there we went to the War Remnants Museum which was also pretty interesting with plenty of mainly anti-American pictures and artifacts from "The American War".
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                Next was the Jade Emperor Pagoda, a Chinese temple that made quite a change from the wats and temples we have been to recently. Finally, we stopped briefly at The Notre Dame Cathedral. This was the least impressive of the places we visited. Riding round the streets of Saigon in a cyclo was an experience in itself and the whole thing was very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once back at the hotel, we booked ourselves on flights from Na Trang to Danang for 13/2 so all our long distance travel in Vietnam is now arranged and we don't need to get involved with long bus journeys.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 5th February</span>
                The bus trip out to Cu Chi took about two hours (35km). Once there, we were shown a video about the tunnels, again with a very anti-American theme. We were shown a selection of body traps and weapons used by the Viet Con during the war and then went to see the tunnels.
            </p>

                Some of them were very small and it was only just possible to get in the entrance way - a couple of the others were bigger (and had electric lights) and you could get through on hands and knees. It was all quite interesting again and was worth the slow bus journey.

                We got dropped back in Saigon just after 2. Didn't do a lot for the rest of the day.

                Checked out of our hotel after breakfast as we were moving to The Majestic. We had pre-booked this on the Internet so that we could be in a decent hotel for Roz's birthday. We got a taxi from where we were staying to the Laos Consulate as we needed Laos visas for when we leave Vietnam. The consulate was the most laid back place we had ever been for visas. We only intended getting transit visas which should have cost $25 - instead of tourist visas which cost $50. However, after about 20 minutes of chatting to the man behind the desk, we came away with tourist visas for $30. We don't really know what was going on but we came out of the deal very well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got another taxi to The Majestic Hotel which was everything we had hoped for - massive bedroom, swimming pool, etc. We spent a few hours by the pool before lunch and then I wandered round the shops for an hour while Roz returned to the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we returned to the main back-packer area for tea and also had a few beers. We got a taxi back to the hotel and continued the session with Mehkong and rum.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 7th February</span>
                Roz's birthday! Had slight hangovers from last night's alcohol. Spent most of the day relaxing by the pool or in the room. For the birthday session we went round a few bars again, went for a pizza and finished off with bottles of run in the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th February</span>
                We had slight hangovers again but did not have to check out of the hotel until 6pm. This meant that we could spend the whole day at the hotel (apart from a trip to the  HSBC bank again) before getting a taxi to the train station at 5:30. The train station was a lot less hassle that we had expected and we were safely on our train by 6:00. We were in a four berth compartment which was pretty comfortable and we departed on time at 6:40.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th February</span>
                We arrived in Nha Trang just after 6am and walked from the station down to the beach where I stayed with the luggage while Roz found us a hotel. After sleeping for a couple of hours we headed for the beach. The beach was quite nice but the weather was not ideal - lots of cloud and very windy. We started to doubt whether or not we want to stay here until Tuesday which is when we have flights booked for.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch we tried (unsuccessfully) to bring our flights forward a couple of days. We also visited a doctor where Roz discovered she has a stomach inflammation and is off alcohol for at least a week. In the evening, we booked ourselves on an island trip for tomorrow and went for a curry.

                The island trip we went on consisted of a boat trip to four different islands. It was not the beast boat trip we have ever been on by a long way but it was a reasonably enjoyable way of spending the day. There was snorkeling at the first two islands (but nothing very spectacular), a beach resort at the third and a fishing village at the last one. The entertainment for the day was provided by our Vietnamese guides singing horrendous versions of English pop songs. The best part of the trip was the food which was excellent. The weather was cloudy and cold for most of the day and it has certainly put us off the idea of diving from Nha Trang.

                In the evening, we went for a pizza and returned to the room to watch Chelsea v Man Utd and to listen to World Service.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 11th February</span>
                We made it to the beach just after 11 but again the weather was not too good. The strong winds made it quite unpleasant for sun-bathing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided that staying in Nha Trang was just wasting time so made our minds up to leave early. We returned to the room, packed and checked out of the hotel. We then went to Sinh Cafe where we had to wait until 2 o'clock before finding out from the airline office that we could get refunds for our flights. As soon as we found that we would get refunds, we booked ourselves on the overnight bus to Hoi An. We lost about $10 each on our flights but overall, it seemed the best thing to do. It saves us some money but gives us an extra day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for another pizza and spent most of the remainder of the day sitting around in Sinh Cafe waiting for the bus to leave at 7pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus was pretty uncomfortable fo an overnight journey - no leg room and no reclining seats. The conditions of the road made sleep just about impossible. After 11, Roz moved onto the floor which gave me a double seat but I still hardly slept during the 14 hour journey.
