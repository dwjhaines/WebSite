                We got off the train just after 5:30 am at Bang Seu, just outside central Bangkok. From here, we got a taxi to Bangkok's Northern bus station and got straight on the 6:30 bus to Aranyaprathet near the Cambodian border. This journey took about four hours. We then got a songthaew out to the border.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The border seemed total chaos with loads of people everywhere and no-one seeming to know where we should be going. We eventually found Thai immigration and managed to leave Thailand. We walked the short distance into Cambodia, bought our visas, cleared immigration, filled out health declarations and finally walked into Poi Pet by 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been warned that Poi Pet was a dump and it certainly lived up to its reputation. We got a pick-up truck fairly quickly to Sisophon and then another onto Battambang. The first journey was not too bad. We were sat inside the cab and although the road was rough, we were reasonably comfortable. The same could not be said for the second. We were sat in the back of the truck with about 18 - 20 locals. I was perched on the side of the truck while Roz was sat on her rucksack which was balanced on the tailgate. It was fine on the sealed parts of the road but very uncomfortable on the rest.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Battambang hot, sweaty, dusty, exhausted and hungry at 3:30. We got a moped (or moto) to a hotel, checked in and had much needed showers. We went out to look for something to eat but were unsuccessful.. Everywhere was either closed (due to Chinese New Year) or unappetising (particularly the market area). We were not much more impressed with Battambang than Poi Pet. We ended up with baguettes and Laughing Cow cheese back in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We also failed to get our evening meal as we gave up in a restaurant due to bad service. We had bread and cheese in the room for a second time and were asleep by 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 25th January</span>
                We were up at 6 and taken by moto to the river for the 7am boat to Siem Reap. The boat journey was pretty good passing plenty of villages, fishing boats, etc. The boat was fairly comfortable and the journey took four hours.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The boat was met by dozens of moto drivers all wanting to take us to hotels and give us tours of Angkor. There was some confusion about who we should be going with but the two drivers we ended up with seemed OK. After they had taken us to a guest house, we agreed that they could take us round for the next two and a half days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up again by our moto drivers at 3 and taken to Angkor Wat (stopping to pay the US$40 entry fee for three days on the way). The building was certainly spectacular and covered a huge area. We walked round looking at the "bas-relief" on the inner walls and climbed up as high as you could go in the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour and a half wandering around and were then taken to Phnom Bakheng, a temple on a hill, to watch the sun set. This was pretty good too but was slightly spoilt by the number of tourists up there.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by 7 and arranged to be picked up at 5am tomorrow. After showers we went to a Thai restaurant near our hotel and then had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 26th January</span>
                We were picked up at 5 by our drivers and were taken to Angkor Wat where the sunrise was probably more spectacular than anything we saw yesterday. We then spent a few hours wandering round the buildings of Angkor Thom including The Bayon Temple, Angkor's second most famous site.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                It was all pretty good to look at and the Bayon and the two terraces by the central square were particularly good. We stopped at a few smaller temples on the way back to the hotel - Chau Say Tevoda, Thommanon, Ta Keo and Prasat Kravan. These were all quite interesting and did not have the same number of tourists as the major sites. We were dropped back at the hotel by 12:30 and decided that that was enough time spent sight-seeing in any one day.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the day wandering around Siem Reap or reading in the hotel. Went out for another Thai meal in the evening.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 27th January</span>
                We were picked up at 7 this morning and after buying tickets for tomorrows journey, were taken to breakfast. We then started on the temples again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to Preah Khan which wasn't that exciting and then onto Ta Prahm which was excellent. This is the only one of the big temples that is not being restored so it is still in the same condition it was in when it was discovered. We got there before most of the tour groups and spent an hour or two wandering round the ruins.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We briefly visited Banteay Kolei and Srah Srang (by which time I had had enough of visiting temples) and were back at the hotel by midday. We said goodbye to our drivers and spent the rest of the day lying around in the room again - it was too hot to do a lot else and we were both worn out following our sight-seeing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out souvenir shopping and ate in the same place as the previous nights. We listened to the football on World Service but I fell asleep before final score again.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another early start as we had tickets for the 7am boat to Phnom Penh. We were ready by 5:30 and eventually picked up at 5:50. A pick-up truck took us down to the boat departure point where there was a scene of complete chaos. There were three boats, all completely full already. We got onto our boat and found a space to sit on the roof. There then followed an hour of complete confusion. The first boat out appeared to either get stuck or break down. Our boat tried to help it and it looked at one point as if all the passengers from the first boat were going to get moved onto ours. A police boat became involved as well but no-one seemed to know what was going on. The problem seemed to resolve itself and we were on our way again by 8:15. The journey was reasonably enjoyable although we both ended up with sun-burnt arms and legs.

                We arrived in Phnom Penh at 1:15 and got a moto to a hotel. After showers, we walked to another guest house to find out about visas for Vietnam and buses that we want to catch later in the week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had sorted everything out we were both completely knackered. We were back at the hotel at 4:30 and fell asleep for a couple of hours. We went out for a pizza for tea and had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 29th January</span>
                We spent the morning sorting out money, visas, bus tickets and a sight-seeing trip. We started by walking out to a bank where getting US$ on the visa card proved relatively straight-forward. We headed back to Capitol Guest House, stopping to buy tickets for Sihanoukville (for tomorrow) on the way. At Capitol we handed in our passports for Vietnamese visas, bought two tickets to Saigon for Saturday and booked ourselves on the 11am trip to The Killing Fields.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time all this was done, we had time for a trip to the post office and a look at our e-mail before the start of the tour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip out to The Killing Fields took about an hour (13km) along an appalling road. The monument was quite dramatic - filled with the skulls of people who had died during Pol Pot's regime - and made the journey worthwhile.

                After lunch we walked around the Buddha factories which were not overly interesting then visited the Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda. While not quite as impressive as Bangkok's equivalents, these were pretty spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we had a pretty poor Indian meal and an early night.

                We checked out of the at 7:30, left our luggage with reception and got a moto out to the bus station. The Sihanoukville bus left at 8:30 and arrived four hours later. We checked into a hotel, had lunch and got a moto out to Ochheuteal Beach where we spent the remainder of the afternoon. The beach was a lot nicer than we had expected it to be.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz was not feeling well when we left the beach so we had another quiet night.

                We did not do a lot in the afternoon. At 4ish, we went to use the internet and collect our passports - complete with Vietnamese visas. We went for a few beers in one of the riverside bars before returning to the hotel and continued drinking with our evening meal. We stopped for another couple at Toms Irish Bar and completed the session with a couple of bottles of Mehkong back in the room.
