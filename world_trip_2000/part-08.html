                We got off the train just after 5:30 am at Bang Seu, just outside central Bangkok. From here, we got a taxi to Bangkok's Northern bus station and got straight on the 6:30 bus to Aranyaprathet near the Cambodian border. This journey took about four hours. We then got a songthaew out to the border.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The border seemed total chaos with loads of people everywhere and no-one seeming to know where we should be going. We eventually found Thai immigration and managed to leave Thailand. We walked the short distance into Cambodia, bought our visas, cleared immigration, filled out health declarations and finally walked into Poi Pet by 11:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been warned that Poi Pet was a dump and it certainly lived up to its reputation. We got a pick-up truck fairly quickly to Sisophon and then another onto Battambang. The first journey was not too bad. We were sat inside the cab and although the road was rough, we were reasonably comfortable. The same could not be said for the second. We were sat in the back of the truck with about 18 - 20 locals. I was perched on the side of the truck while Roz was sat on her rucksack which was balanced on the tailgate. It was fine on the sealed parts of the road but very uncomfortable on the rest.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Battambang hot, sweaty, dusty, exhausted and hungry at 3:30. We got a moped (or moto) to a hotel, checked in and had much needed showers. We went out to look for something to eat but were unsuccessful.. Everywhere was either closed (due to Chinese New Year) or unappetising (particularly the market area). We were not much more impressed with Battambang than Poi Pet. We ended up with baguettes and Laughing Cow cheese back in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We also failed to get our evening meal as we gave up in a restaurant due to bad service. We had bread and cheese in the room for a second time and were asleep by 9:30.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 25th January</span>
                We were up at 6 and taken by moto to the river for the 7am boat to Siem Reap. The boat journey was pretty good passing plenty of villages, fishing boats, etc. The boat was fairly comfortable and the journey took four hours.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
                border="0"

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The boat was met by dozens of moto drivers all wanting to take us to hotels and give us tours of Angkor. There was some confusion about who we should be going with but the two drivers we ended up with seemed OK. After they had taken us to a guest house, we agreed that they could take us round for the next two and a half days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up again by our moto drivers at 3 and taken to Angkor Wat (stopping to pay the US$40 entry fee for three days on the way). The building was certainly spectacular and covered a huge area. We walked round looking at the "bas-relief" on the inner walls and climbed up as high as you could go in the centre.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour and a half wandering around and were then taken to Phnom Bakheng, a temple on a hill, to watch the sun set. This was pretty good too but was slightly spoilt by the number of tourists up there.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
                border="0"

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by 7 and arranged to be picked up at 5am tomorrow. After showers we went to a Thai restaurant near our hotel and then had an early night.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 26th January</span>
                We were picked up at 5 by our drivers and were taken to Angkor Wat where the sunrise was probably more spectacular than anything we saw yesterday. We then spent a few hours wandering round the buildings of Angkor Thom including The Bayon Temple, Angkor's second most famous site.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
                border="0"

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It was all pretty good to look at and the Bayon and the two terraces by the central square were particularly good. We stopped at a few smaller temples on the way back to the hotel - Chau Say Tevoda, Thommanon, Ta Keo and Prasat Kravan. These were all quite interesting and did not have the same number of tourists as the major sites. We were dropped back at the hotel by 12:30 and decided that that was enough time spent sight-seeing in any one day.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the day wandering around Siem Reap or reading in the hotel. Went out for another Thai meal in the evening.
