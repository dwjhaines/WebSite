                We needed to sort out our Thai visas, buy train tickets to Had Yai and get money out. Things got off to a bad start when we were given wrong directions to the bank and ended up near The Petronas Towers with no HSBC in sight. We decided to go into central K.L. by (LRT) where we at least knew where the bank was. We got money out and manged to buy our train tickets without too many problems, but after spending ages trying to phone the Thai Embassy, discovered that it was closed for the day.
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel and spent the rest of the day making the most of the hotels facilities.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 6th December</span>
                We got up and walked straight out to the Thai Embassy stopping for roti canai on the way. The embassy was not the most organised of places but we filled out the forms and left our passports fairly quickly.
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the hotel and had a similar day to yesterday - making the most of the pool and gym.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got the LRT into Chinatown where we ate and used the Internet.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 7th December</span>
                We spent an hour or so by the pool in the morning before checking out at midday. We left our luggage at the hotel and walked out to the Thai Embassy where we had our passports returned complete with Thai visas.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel and once again spent the remainder of the afternoon by the pool, in the gym or in the steam room, jacuzzi, etc. The facilities were fantastic, far better than any hotel we had stayed at before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi from the hotel at 6 to the railway station. We put our luggage into left luggage and went into K.L. to eat before returning to catch the 9pm train for Had Yai.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 8th December</span>
                The train journey was uneventful and we arrived in Hat Yai a couple of hours late at midday (Thai time). We walked out to the mini-bus stand for transport to Trang and were on our way by about 1:15. The journey took about two hours and we were dropped outside the hotel we wanted to stay at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were desperate for food not having eaten all day so went straight out for a late lunch. We wandered round the town for a while and returned to the hotel. We did not do a lot for the remainder of the day except go out to eat again in the evening. We also booked our mini-bus tickets to Ko Lanta for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 9th December</span>
                We were picked up from our hotel just after 11 and transferred to a mini-bus which left on time at 11:30. The journey to Ko Lanta took just over two hours and included two vehicle ferry crossings. We were dropped in Ban Sala Dan and were collected in a pick-up truck by the hotel that we had managed to book via the Internet. We checked in and were given another bungalow right on the edge of a beautiful beach. It is not quite as scenic as at Rai Lai but the bungalow and area where we are staying is far nicer.

                We ate in the resort's restaurant and spent the remainder of the afternoon on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we walked back into Sala Dan and looked round a couple of dive operators. We ate in the town and had a bottle of Mehkong with our meal. We walked back to the bungalows and had a second bottle of Mehkong and then watched Sunderland v Middlesborough while drinking the duty free Bacardi that I have been carrying round for almost six weeks. Don't remember much after the football finished.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 10th December</span>
                Didn't do a lot all day apart from lie on the beach, eat and sleep off the hangovers. Decided that we would stay here an extra three days (we had pre-booked five days) which will give us two nights in Phi-Phi before returning to Rai Leh.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 11th December</span>
                We walked into Ban Sala Dan in the morning to book a days diving for tomorrow and to use the Internet. Spent the afternoon on the beach.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 12th December</span>
                We were picked up at 7:30 and taken to "The Dive Zone" in Sala Dan. We got onto the boat and left just after 8. The boat appeared to be the smallest of all the dive operators in Lanta but had a lot less people on it so there was plenty of space. We were given breakfast on the way out to the dive site and arrived there at about 10.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first dive (Ko Ha #1) was not too successful as Roz had problems staying underwater and we had to come up after about 15 minutes. The second dive (Ko Ha #5), however, was excellent and overall, it was a pretty good trip (we decided we will probably go again later in the week).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at our bungalow by about 5 and started on the Mehkong not much later. We had a few drinks in the room and continued drinking in the restaurant and eventually the bar.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 13th December</span>
                Had slight hangovers but not as bad as two days ago. Arranged to go diving with The Dive Zone again tomorrow.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 14th December</span>
                A similar day to Tuesday. We dived the same two dive sites which we were quite happy about - this time we had no problems and it was another excellent trip. We booked a third dive trip for Saturday.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 15th December</span>
                We decided that we would miss out on going to Phi Phi and booked into the same room we are staying in until Tuesday.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 16th December</span>
                Another good days diving. The first dive was at the King Cruiser wreck which was excellent and the second at Hin Bida - probably the nicest of the sites we have been to on our three trips.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Had a quiet evening. We saw some of the football on tele but listened to World Service for most of the game.

                Spent the morning on the beach and walked into Sala Dan for lunch at 2ish. By the time we had finished lunch, it had started raining. We used the interent and headed back to the bungalow.

                We watched the Man U v Liverpool game with Andy who we had met when we arrived here and then continued drinking in the restaurant after the game. We did not drink much but ended up staying in the restaurant until 2am.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 18th December</span>
                A day spent mainly on the beach. We had spent a lot of time debating about whether to leave on Tuesday and spend three nights back at Rai Leh or to move our departure date back again and leave on Friday. By the time we had decided to stay, our bungalow had been reserved by someone else for tomorrow night so we are finally leaving. Ko Lanta has definitely been one of the best places visited on the trip so far.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we met up with Phil who had been in the long-tail boat with us and Lorren. We had a couple of bottles of Thai whiskey in the bar at the place we were staying and then continued the session in a couple of bars at the other side of Rai Leh. Got back to the room at 2ish.

                Spent the morning on the beach. After lunch, we walked round to the other side of Rai Leh and visited "Inner Princess Cave". The cave was pretty good but not as spectacular as ones we saw in Borneo. When we arrived the generator was not working so we entered the cave using my torch. We had almost got to the deepest part of the cave when the bulb went leaving us to feel our way back in total darkness. By the time we were out, the generator was almost fixed so we went round again while it was lit up.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It was overcast by the time we finished in the cave so we spent the remainder of the afternoon in the room.

                We left Rai Leh at 9:30 and spent another day messing about with various forms of transport to get to Samui. We got a long-tail boat to Krabi and a mini-bus from there at 11. We were dropped in Surat Thani (inevitably) at 2:20 and sat around waiting until 3:30 until we were picked up by a big bus to take us to Don Sak. There was another 40 minute wait here and the ferry eventually left 30 minutes late at 5:30. We were taken to the vehicle ferry pier by 7 and got back on the bus again, eventually getting into Na Thon by about 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had already decided to stay in Na Thon for the night as it was not worth going out to Lamai so we checked into a hotel near where the bus dropped us. We had our first meal since leaving Rai Leh but most of the town had closed so we had an early night.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 23rd December</span>
                After breakfast, we walked to the Sang Serm office and booked our train tickets for when we leave Samui in two weeks time. We got a pick-up to Lamai and by about 10:30 were back at Weekender. We had a few hours by the pool and then I had to return to Na Thon to collect the tickets we had booked this morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had two football matches to watch - the first at 6:30 in Will Wait and the 10pm game in The Rising Sun. We had a few beers in the Austrian bar in between games and don't remember getting back to the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Pong seems to have totally disappeared from Lamai and his restaurant has been turned into a bar.

                Dave, Cathy, Ed, Regan and Annette all turned up together just before 7. After managing to get out of going to the gala meal we all headed out around the bars of Lamai. We started on the wheat beer in The Thai Cat, ate in Tom and Jerry and got completely wrecked in The Rising Sun. Don't know what time we got back to the room.

                We spent the morning sleeping off the effects of last night's Mehkong. By about midday we were up to opening presents and by 3pm we were able to have our first drink of the day. We started in the Austrian bar and at 4:30 went to The Rising Sun for Christmas dinner with turkey and all the trimmings.

                We had a few beers with the meal and another in The Thai Cat and then started on the Mehkong in Bikers and Rockers. Severe drunkenness started setting in at this point with everyone either making idiots of themselves on the dance floor or falling asleep at the table (or both).

                Did not do a lot all day due to hangovers. By 6pm we were all ready to start again. We met up in the Austrian bar, ate in Tom and Jerry's and then watched the football in Bauhaus. Once again, we ended up drinking Mehkong in Bikers and Rockers. Me and Ed were the only two awake by 4:20 but I have no idea what time we all made it back to our rooms.

                After three or four days on the Mehkong, there were some bad hangovers around and a day off was required. Dave and Ed seemed to be affected the worst and spent most of the day lying in their room. Neither was capable of eating anything let alone starting to drink again. The rest of us were not much better although we could get up for meals. We ate tea at Meng's and had an early night.

                A quiet day by the pool, etc. We were back on the Mehkong in the evening after a few wheat beers and by 2am it was turning into the normal sort of session.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I can't remember the full sequence of events but after leaving Bauhaus, Cathy & Ed decided to walk back to the hotel. Just before they reached the entrance to Weekender, Cathy was hit by a moped and was knocked to the floor. The rest of us were collected from Bikers and Rockers and an ambulance was called.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Dave, Roz and I (plus Paul from Liverpool) accompanied Cathy in the ambulance to Bandon Hospital where she was eventually diagnosed as having broken her pelvis and right foot. There followed a lot of waiting around, some of us with Cathy and others making phone calls to insurance companies, etc. Cathy was moved to a private room but was obviously going to need to be flown home. We spent the whole night at the hospital but by about 8am, Roz, Paul and I returned to Lamai leaving Dave asleep in Cathy's room.

                We spent the whole day taking it in turns to visit Cathy. Ed and I went back to relieve Dave and Roz turned up in the afternoon. The insurance company did not seem to be moving with any great speed and there was no indication of when Cathy would be able to fly home. Due to her pelvis, a stretcher was required all the way back to London and availability on the flights seemed to be causing a problem.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It did not seem like a good idea to leave Cathy on her own so Roz stayed the night at the hospital.

                A similar day to yesterday. We discovered during the day that Cathy's foot was not broken but that her shoulder was. This was no great surpise as most of the pain was in her shoulder.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There was still no indication of when Cathy could be flown home but we were told that she could leave Samui and fly to Bangkok tomorrow and wait there for the international flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We all left the hospital in the evening and went to a "Pork Knuckle Night" at the Austrian bar. We watched the football in Bauhaus but went straight to bed when it finished at midnight.

                Roz and I went straight up to the hospital when we woke at 7 and we were joined by everyone else a couple of hours later. I rang the insurance company in Bangkok again to find out about the flight back to London and was told that it may not be until Wednesday at the earliest.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a lot of discussion, it was decided that Roz and I should go up to Bangkok as well and remain there until Cathy flies home. Hopefully we would be able to meet up with Dave and Ed later in the week. Roz rang up and reserved two seats on the 2:20 flight (Cathy's flight was 12:40) and Ed & I returned to Weekender to pack up Roz and my things and check out of our bungalow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Ed and I got a taxi to the airport where I collected Roz and my tickets. Regan, Annette and Dave met us there having come directly from the hospital. Roz came to the airport in the ambulance with Cathy. Once we were all at the airport, the doctor, who had come down from Bangkok to collect Cathy, tried his best to get us on the same flight as her but after several attempts he failed and she had to leave without us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had lunch with the others, said our goodbyes and left Samui 20 minutes early at 2pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In Bangkok, Cathy was taken to the hospital by ambulance and we followed a bit later by taxi. At the hospital, Cathy had more x-rays and it was discovered that her pelvis was not broken. This was excellent news as it meant that she could sit up and would not require a stretcher to get her home.... and could in theory get on tonight's flight to London.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Cathy was taken to her room at about 5:30, 7 hours before the flight was due to depart.

                Most of the next 4 - 5 hours were spent either sat around waiting in the room, phoning the insurance company or running round the hospital trying to get faxes sent and re-sent. Although neither the doctor or the insurance company seemed that bothered about getting Cathy onto tonight's flight, we eventually got it all sorted out any by about 10, all the paperwork was completed and it was agreed she could go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a bit more waiting around but at about 11 we were all taken to the airport where Cathy and the doctor checked in. There was a lot of confusion at the check-in counter and we thought at one point that she may not be able to fly, but it all got sorted out and just after midnight, Cathy was taken through into customs and was on her way home.

                After Cathy left us, we phoned her Mum to give her the news and then headed to The Brew House for a few much needed beers. It had been a different New Year's Eve but certainly one which we would remember!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been offered the use of Cathy's hospital room for the night but decided instead to ahng around at the airport and try and get on an early flight back to Samui. We left The Brew House at 2:45 and went to sit outside the Bangkok Airways office in the domestic terminal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The offices started opening at 5:30 and much to our relief we were able to get seats on the first flight at 6:30. By 9am we were back at Weekender where we checked into a hotel room and went straight to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We slept for the remainder of the day and by 6pm it was back to normal drinking again. We all had a few beers and a meal in Landhaus (except Annette, who is still recoveering from last night) and then started on the Mehkong in The Thai Cat, Rising Sun and Bauhaus. I vaguely remember watching the 3am match in Bauhaus and woke up there at 7am

                Spent another day mainly sleeping due to a combination of a lack of sleep recently and the effects of last night's alcohol. Regan and Annette left at 10 to go to Krabi but we did not see them before they left.

                Spent the day by the pool for the first time in which seemed like ages.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had Dave and Ed's official leaving session in the evening. It followed the usual format starting in Landhaus and continuing at Tom and Jerry's, Rising Sun and Bikers & Rockers. We all managed to return home together sometime between 3 and 4.

                Managed to spend most of the day by the pool again. Dave and Ed checked out of their room at midday and left their stuff in our room until they departed for the airport at 6.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a few wheat beers and ended up eating at Landhaus. We returned to the room and finished a bottle of Sang Som on our balcony..... and then bought another bottle from the hotel bar. We tried to drink the Thai wine that we had bought Caty for Christmas but, although we were quite pissed it was totally undrinkable.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 6th January</span>
                The weather was bad again (we have only really had a couple of nice days in the last week) which did not really matter as we both had hangovers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we ate (and drank) in Landhaus again and then returned to the room to listen to the football on World Service. We both fell asleep during the second half and missed the results.

                We checked out of Weekender at midday and got a songthaew into Na Thon. We had lunch and got the "Express Ferry" to Surat Thani. This journey took about three hours. We had the usual 30 minute wait for no apparent reason at the Song Serm bus station before being transferred to Surat Thani train station. We stocked up with food for the journey and boarded the 6:20 train for Bangkok. The train was not as good as the Malaysian ones but was still pretty comfortable. I fell asleep by 9.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 8th January</span>
                We arrived in Bangkok at about 7:30, only 30 minutes late. We had already booked tickets to Nong Khai on this evening's overnight train so we left our bags at the stations left luggage.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus from the station to the Khao San Road area. We had a couple of phone calls to make to the Vietnamese and Cambodian Embassies and also went round a couple of travel agencies finding out details of some of our options when we return to Bangkok.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the morning trying without much success to exchange the pile of books that we had accumulated over the last month.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At midday, we met up with Steven and Lillian again. We had kept in touch by e-mail and had arranged a pub to meet in. We spent about four hours with them discussing where they had been, where they were going, where we had been, etc, etc. We had lunch with them and then said our goodbyes for the last time as they fly to Nepal tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 4, we got another bus back to the station (almost) and sat around waiting for a couple of hours for the train to Nong Khai. The train left about 30 minutes late and once again, I was asleep by 9.
