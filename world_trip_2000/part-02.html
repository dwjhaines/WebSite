                After breakfast, we went out looking for alternative places to stay. We found somewhere in between the Poppies Lanes with nicer rooms, a better pool, a better location and less than half the price. We booked a room and returned to Hotel Karthi to collect our luggage. We had a brief argument with the manager about service/room price and left at about 11. By midday we were by the pool and generally a lot happier with Kuta than 12 hours previously.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a couple of hours by the pool we set off to find out prices of airline tickets so we could plan what we are doing for our stay in Indonesia. We had quite a few options in mind but after finding out about flights, only one of our plans remained a realistic option. We will try and fly to Flores in about two weeks time, spend 3 - 4 weeks traveling back to Bali and leave Indonesia a couple of weeks earlier than planned. This will give us an extra couple of weeks to go to Thailand at the end of October.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the afternoon, we also collected mail from Poste Restante at Kuta Post Office. In the evening we got pissed, taking advantage of the cheap beer (50p a pint during happy hour) and the large "Jam Jar" cocktails served at The Bounty. I don't remember leaving The Bounty.

                We did not have too bad hangovers but had a fairly quiet day anyway. We had hoped to sort out our flights but, today being a Sunday, we could not do a lot.

                We managed to book, pay for and collect our tickets to Maumere for Friday 15th. We also managed to move our Garuda flight back to Singapore forward by a couple of weeks as decided on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the rest of the day was spent lying by the pool or wandering round Kuta's shops and restaurants.

                We checked out of our hotel at midday and reserved a room as we intend to be back on Saturday. At 1, we got the shuttle to Padang Bai. This was a three hour journey involving a change of buses at Ubud. The bus dropped us outside the hotel we stayed at last time we were in Padang Bai and we checked into the room above the one we had before. We could not be bothered to go to the beach but were fortunate to catch the start of a ceremony that will apparently last for the next three days. We spent almost an hour watching the traditional dancing before is ended.

                Spent most of the day at the beach - the morning at the small beach that we used last time we were here and the afternoon at the main beach overlooking the harbour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                All day, there was a steady flow of people dressed in traditional costume walking to the temple on the hill overlooking the village. Once there, they sat around and preyed and left their offerings before leaving and walking down the hill again. No-one seemed to stay in Padang Bai. They turned up from all over Bali and then left again. we still don't really know what is going on but it is a very colourful sight and is reasonably interesting.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 7th September</span>
                A similar day to yesterday apart from the fact that we did not go to the beach in the afternoon. The ceremony continued but with far fewer people than yesterday.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 8th September</span>
                We checked out after breakfast and headed towards Selat from where we hope to climb Mt. Agung tomorrow morning. We had a few disagreements with the bemo drivers in Padang Bai which resulted in a change to our planned route but we still managed to get to Selat by about midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were not sure how we went about finding a guide for tomorrows climb and had no idea which way to go when we got dropped in Selat. However, we quickly found an office advertising trips and went in to speak to the guide. For Rp75,000 each, we joined a group consisting of five French students, who had arrived at the same time as us, and one other couple. We got taken to the only hotel in Selat and checked into a double room. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text">
                There was not a lot to do in Selat. We spent an hour or so walking around the area looking at rice terraces and the rest of the afternoon in the room. At 5:30, we were picked up by the guide who took us plus the French group to a restaurant about 5km away. We had a surprisingly good meal and were back for an early night by 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 9th September</span>
                The alarm went off at 1:20 and we were collected by our guide ten minutes later. We were joined at the guide's office by the other couple (Wayne and Susan from Birmingham) and were all driven up to the temple at the start of the walk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We began walking just after 2 and were aiming to get to the top for sun-rise. The first half of the climb was not too exciting. The path was steep through forest and quite hard work. By the halfway point, the group had been completely split up. The French students had gone ahead with the guide, we were lagging some way behind with the guide's assistant and Wayne & Susan had had to turn back as she was afraid of heights and was finding it all a bit hard going.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                From the halfway point to the top was also quite difficult but I found it a lot more enjoyable. There was no real path to follow but a lot of climbing up the side of the mountain. We eventually made it to the top by 7:15. We had missed the sunrise by an hour but the views from the top were superb anyway.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We all had tea and pot noodles at the top for breakfast. The French lot were well pissed off by this stage as they had been waiting over an hour!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The views on the way down were also excellent but once again, the walking was very hard going, particularly the last half. We got back to the car-park by 1pm, 2 hours later than expected - the bemo driver had been waiting since 9:30.

                We were both completely knackered by the tie we got to Selat but we decided to head off immedeatly and try and get back to Kuta as soon as possible. We checked out of our room by 2 and went to stand by the main road hoping for a bemo going anywhere in the general direction of where we wanted to go. WE were not very hopeful but within about ten minutes, a bus came along that was heading to Dempasar. The driver told us that he would take us all the way to Kuta for Rp50,000 which seemed like a good deal all round. The journey was not particularly quick but by 5:30, we were back at Bali Sari Cottages.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It was a huge relief to remove our walking boots - they had been on our feet for 16 hours - and then get under a hot shower.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Feeling refreshed, we headed out for much needed food..... and the start of happy hours. We talked to Cathy and Ed in the chat room at 8:30 and continued drinking beer and Jam Jars until gone 1:30 (by which time we had been up for more than 24 hours).

                We were pretty tired and hungover so did not do a lot all day. Our legs were in the same mess that they had been in after climbing Kinabalu so walking anywhere, particularly downhill was proving very painful.

                Spent the day by the pool and the evening in a selection of Kuta's night spots - Bali Rock Cafe (Big Bopper Burger and Rubber Ducks), Peanuts (Jam Jars) and The Original Bounty (U.F.O.'s). We also had a few beers in a selection of quieter bars and returned to the room at about 1:30. Drank duty free Bacardi before falling asleep.

                We nearly missed breakfast as we did not wake up until 10:52 and could not find our key so were locked in. Otherwise, a quiet uneventful day spent lying by the pool and eating.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 13th September</span>
                Another quiet day. At lunchtime, we had a walk out to a supermarket and the post office. Roz reconfirmed Friday's flights and I had my hair cut. We went to a Mexican restaurant in the evening. An excellent, if not typically Indonesian, meal!

                Our last full day in Kuta before he head off into Nusa Tengarra and a similar day to yesterday. I posted Ayla's birthday present from the main post office and we sorted out books and money for the next few weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We discovered today that we are both going to have problems cashing travelers cheques on this trip. Roz dated all hers when she first received them which means that some places wont accept them. We had been trying to use as many as possible of her cheques as we found somewhere that was happy with them and gave good rates. However, today I tried to change my first one and was told that it could not be accepted as the signature did not match the one in my passport. We eventually found a place that would accept it but this could cause problems in the future. We also discovered that we no longer possess the travelers cheque receipt.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 15th September</span>
                We had an early breakfast and left Sari Bali Cottages at 7:40. We got the 8:00 Perama shuttl bus to the airport, checked in and took off on time at 9:20 on teh Merpati flight to Maumere in Flores.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were in Maumere by 11:30 and got a taxi to the Ende bus terminal. We had a short wait for a bus heading for Moni from where we will visit Kelimutu tomorrow. The bus was totally packed but we did get seats after an hour or so. the journey was not too bad and we arrived in Moni by about 4. We decided to stay at the third or fourth losman that we looked at and went for a short walk around the village.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There was not a lot to do in Moni (we didn't fancy the traditional dancing) so we went for a meal and were in bed by about 9.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 16th September</span>
                We got up just after 4am and were taken by Jeep up to Kelimutu. There was no long walk up to the summit from the car park - it took about five minutes to reach the rim of the first volcano - so we were up on the rim for sunrise. We walked all round path that circles the "green" and turquoise lakes and up to the lookout point from where you could see all three.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The views were superb and the whole thing was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. We stayed at the top while the sun came up until it started shining on the lakes and bringing out the true colours. We walked back along the rim path for more pictures and eventually started heading back down at 8ish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The walk down (we had told our Jeep driver not to wait) was quite enjoyable and not quite as taxing on the legs as last Saturday's walk. We were back in Moni by 10 just in time for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the hotel after breakfast and within about ten minutes had got ourselves onto a bus going to Ende. This journey was just under two hours and was reasonably comfortable. So far, bus travel in Flores has proved easier than expected.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Ende, we got a bemo straight to the hotel we wanted to stay at and spent most of the afternoon generally relaxing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of walks into the main part of Ende (about a mile away) once to look around and once for our evening meal and were back in the hotel by 9:30. We had hoped to watch football but despite the hotel's satellite TV, this was not possible. We spent a couple of hours listening to World Service.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 17th September</span>
                Got up at 8ish and left the hotel straight away. We were heading to Bajawa and had been told by hotel staff that the only bus of the day left at 6am. We did not really believe them but had no real idea how easy it was going to be to get anywhere today. However, as soon as we got to the bus terminal, two drivers started trying to get us onto their respective buses which were apparently heading for Bajawa at 10am. We didn't want to get on either bus as they were both empty so we sat around waiting to see what would happen. After 15 minutes, another bus turned up heading for Ruteng. Everyone tried to convince us that it would not go to Bajawa (we knew it had to) but we got on it and were on our way by 8:30. The journey took about four hours and by 1 we had checked into another hotel/losman.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for something to eat and on our way back to the hotel, met the hotel's owner who told us there was a football match about to start at the "stadium" about 200m away. We paid our Rp1000 (about 8p) and joined a crowd of about 4 - 500 people for the game between Bajawa and Soa. We saw most of the warm up game between two local teams and were in the ground for just over three hours. The standard of football was not great but it was a highly entertaining and cheap afternoon.

                We had booked ourselves on a tour of local villages, the main reason for visiting Bajawa. We left after breakfast at 8:30 in a chrtered bemo with an English couple, four Scandinavians and Theo, our tour guide.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The tour was surprisingly good and interesting. We visited a couple of traditional villages in the morning and some hot springs in the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The primitive villages contained traditional houses and ceremonial alters, tombs, etc as well as a few local inhabitants. It was all very picturesque with plenty of ideal photo opportunities.

                Two villages were enough to visit - any more and it probably would have got boring - so after lunch, we headed off to the hot springs at Soa. These were also superb with pools and waterfalls containing naturally heated water up to 45°c. We were the only ones there and we spent about an hour sat around in the water.

                We were collected by the Ruteng bus from our hotel at 7am and it eventually left Bajawa at 7:40. The journey took five hours.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Ruteng did not have too much to offer. The villages are apparently not as good as those near Bajawa and our main reason for stopping was to break up the bus journey. After we had eaten lunch, we went for a walk to a hill overlooking the town. Apart from that, we spent the afternoon back at the hotel.

                We were up at 7 expecting to get the 8:00 bus to Labuan Bajo - the last leg of our cross Flores bus journey. At 7:35, while we were still packing, the bus jockey knocked on our door and we were on the bus a few minutes later. The journey took about five and a half hours and was not too bad. I don't know if we had just been lucky but we don't seem to have had any particularly bad journeys.

                We had been recommended to stay at The Gardena Hotel and the bus dropped us right outside. We were shown to a room with a balcony overlooking the harbour - possibly the best view we have ever had from a hotel room.

                We spent the afternoon trying to find out what options are open to us for the next week or so. We need to get to Lombok via Sumbawa stopping at Komodo and/or Rinca on the way. The ferries are no longer reliable but we have heard very mixed reports about chartering boats or going on a cruise. We found out prices of trips to Komodo/Rinca and also discovered that a Pelni ship leaves here for Sumbawa Besa in eight days time which may be ideal.

                We got pissed in the evening, drinking Bacardi on our balcony and beer in a couple of restaurants that also overlook the harbour. We were with Steve and Lillian, an Irish couple who we have bumped into a few times in the last few days, for a lot of the evening and I think they may have convinced us that we should do a PADI diving course before leaving Indonesia.

                A typical hangover day spent not doing a lot. We eventually decided to do a one day trip to Rinca and bought our tickets for tomorrow.

                We were up at 6 for the start of our trip at 7. We had effectively chartered a fisshing boat for the day to take us to Rinca and back stopping at an island for snorkeling on the way home. It was a pleasant two and a half ohur trip to Rinca. We left the boat and walked into the national park. We had to pay to enter the park and also for a guide to take us on a walk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As soon as we entered the park we saw four dragons lying by the canteen. We were able to get much closer to them than I had expected which was ideal for taking pictures. The walk around the island was not as spectacular but we did see another 3 - 4 dragons along the way.

                Dragon spotting over, we returned to the boat and were taken to a superb beach with excellent snorkeling. The coral here was as good as we have ever seen it and there were also plenty of fish. We were back at Labuan Bajo in time to watch another sunset from the balcony.

                We left the main part of Labuan Bajo and went out to Waecicu Beach Resort. This was basically a collection of bamboo bungalows on a beach a 20 minute boat ride away. There was not a lot to do there and the facilities were basic (no electricity or running water) but it was quite a relaxing place to spend a couple of days.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 25th September</span>
                Left Waecicu at 7:15 at the start of our journey back to Lombok. We had decided against the Pelni boat on Thursday as two days was long enough at Waecicu, we had already been on a one day boat trip and the ferries to Sumbawa appeared to be running on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were taken by boat to Labuan Bajo in time for the 8 o'clock daily ferry to Sape on Sumbawa. The boat left on time and it was a fairly comfortable eight hour journey. At Sape, we got straight on a bus to Bima (1½ hours) and by 7pm we were on a luxury air-conditioned bus heading for Mataran on Lombok. This journey took thirteen hours including the ferry crossing to Lombok. From Mataran, it took us an hour to get to Sengiggi by bemo.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The whole trip had taken us 26 hours but had been reasonably enjoyable. The mixture of bus and ferry meant that no leg of the trip became too boring.

                After breakfast, we went round a few places gathering details of dive courses. The first place we went to seemed to be the best and we arranged for an introductary dive at our hotel swimming pool for this afternoon. We spent a fwe hours lying (and sleeping) by the pool. The dive instrutor turned up at around 3:30 and we had our first attempt at scuba diving. We put on all the equipment, put our heads under the water for the first time and then swam up and down the length of the pool with the instructor. Even in the swimming pool, this was an excellent experiance and confirmed that we are going to do the full course (and that we are both capable of doing it!)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We watched the sunset from our balcony and started on our second bottle of duty free Bacardi. After a few drinks, we went round a few of Sengiggi's happy hours and don't really remember the latter stages of the evening.

                Due to hangovers and a lack of sleep the previous night, we did not get up until 1pm. After a couple of hours by the pool, we spent an hour using the internet and then went to book our PADI course. We decided on the first place we went to yesterday and booked a four day course starting on Saturday. We will do the course on Gili Air.

                We were picked up from our hotel by Dream Divers just after 8 and were driven up the coast to where their boats depart to the Gili Islands. The boat trip out Gili Air took about 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped on the beach by the dive centre which was pretty close to where we had stayed five and a half years ago.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The first morning was all theory. We watched videos, had them explained by Ashley - our instructor - and then answered multiple choice questions on what we had learnt.

            <p class="diary-text">
                (During the first lesson, we spotted Steve and Lillian walking past, they were the Irish couple who had persuaded us to do the course two weeks ago! To add to the coincidence, we ended up staying in the bungalow next door to us)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We did OK on the theory due to our advance reading and, after lunch moved on to our first confined water dives. We had decided to do the confined water dives in the sea instead of a swimming pool. This made the first lessons more difficult but is supposed to make the step up to the open water dives less dramatic.

                The first confined water dives were quite good fun and we managed to complete all the skills without any problems. The whole day was quite good fun but quite hard work - we were both totally worn out by the end of the day.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 2:</span>
                A similar day to yesterday really. In the morning we watched the last two videos, completed the reviews and took the exam. We both managed 98% in the exam! The afternoon's confined water dives were a lot more challenging than yesterdays. The skills were harder and a strong current made it all much more difficult. It was hard work trying to stay in one place let alone try the skills and we were both completely exhausted by 5pm. We still had a few exercises to complete but Ashley decided to leave them until tomorrow and call it a day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out to one of the restaurants along the beach with Steve and Lillian. When we were here five and a half years ago, there were only one or two restaurants on the island, now there are loads of them all doing excellent food. We had a pretty good meal and were back in our bungalows by 10:30.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 3:</span>
                Today we did our first two open water dives. We were taken out to the dive sites by boat, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Both dives involved going in backwards off the side of the boat which proved easier than expected. The first dive was a "fun dive" i.e. it involved no exercises. Roz had a bit of a panic as we went down but Ashley managed to keep her underwater and we kept going. The first dive was not overly enjoyable. There seemed to be a lot to try and concentrate on and neither of us were relaxed enough to take much notice of our surroundings.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                I had my panic near the start of the second dive. This involved several mouthfuls of water and an attempt to get to the surface. Again, Ashley held me down until my breathing was under control and after that, I was able to start to relax a bit more. This dive was far better than this mornings. We were under water for about 43 minutes for both dives. This time we could concentrate more on looking at the fish and also did not need to hold on to Ashley all the time! We had completed all the skills that we had missed out on yesterday so all in all it was quite a successful day.

                <span class="diary-date">Day 4:</span>
                Today involved finishing our remaining skills and two dives to 18m. Both these dives were superb and made the whole course worthwhile. It was incredible how much easier than yesterday the diving felt and how much more confident we both were under the water. The fish were excellent - far too many to list or remember and we also saw turtles on both dives. We completed our remaining skills and proved we could swim 200m and tread water for 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 4pm we had completed the fourth dive and were officially qualified scuba divers. We sorted out all the paperwork and were given our PADI certification.

We spent the morning by the pool, had a late lunch and started drinking at about 5pm. We got through a half bottle of rum on our balcony and went round a few bars until everything closed at about 11.

                We had hoped to find a bar showing the England v Germany game in the evening but everywhere was fairly dead and a lot of places were either closed or empty by kick-off time and no-where looked likely to be showing it. We had already had a few beers by this time so we bought a bottle of arak and returned to our balcony to listen to the game on the radio. After the game we joined a group of people who were drinking in the restaurant but I don't remember too much about this part of the evening.

                We were collected from our hotel at 8:30 by a guide from Maoka Dive and were driven an hour up the coast to Tulamben. Tulamben is the site of a sunken wreck - U.S.A.T. Liberty - that was torpedoed by the Japanese during WWII. We had two dives, both from the beach, to the wreck which is only about 50m from the beach. Everything was a bit more laid back than it had been when we were learning - there was no BWRAF or Five Point Descent, it was more a case of "Get the gear on and get underwater!" However, our guide seemed to know what he was doing and everything seemed to work correctly.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The dives were excellent again. There was not the huge range of fish that we had seen from Gili Air but the fish here seemed to come much closer to you and the large schools of Jacks were very spectacular. The wreck itself also made the dive interesting with plenty of the ship still in tact but covered with coral and barnacles.

                We checked out of the hotel at 8ish and started making our way towards Mt Batur. We got to Penelokan in about two hours with one bus and two bemos for a total cost of Rp 15,000 - about 10% osome of the private transport fees we had been quoted in Candidasa. At Penelokan, we were approched by a tout from the hotel that we wanted to stay at so got a free lift down to Kedisan at the lake inside the outer crater.

                We checked into the hotel and were then offered the services of a guide fo US$25 each. This is a ridiculous amount of money for what is involved and we turned it down straight away.

                We set off from our hotel just after 11 hoping either to climb the mountain or arrange for a cheaper guide for tomorrow. We did not manage to get up the mountain ourselves as the paths were not clear. Helpful locals could offer directions for Rp10 - 20,000 but we did not accept the offers and settled for a two and a half hour walk around the lake instead. We did find cheaper guides for tomorrow. There is now a "Guides Association" which seems to have taken control of everyone climbing the mountain and would let us have a guide between us for Rp175,000. This is still far too expensive so we decided to give up and haggle for something cheaper in the morning.

By pretending that we were not really bothered about going up the mountain, we managed to get this down to 80,000 for a guide to take us up but not back down again.

                We had a quick breakfast and then got a bemo up the hill to Penelokan. From there we had a two and a half hour bus journey to Batubulan terminal in Dempasar. By this time we had had enough of public transport so chartered a bemo to take us back to Kuta. By 2pm we had checked into Sari Bali Cottages for the third time in six weeks.

                We had lunch and then spent a couple of hours by the pool. In the evening, we bought a bottle of arak and got drunk in our usual selection of bars.

                We did not get up until after 1 due to hangovers and tiredness. We did not make it to the pool all day but did manage to get quite a lot done i.e. reconfirmed flights, collected mail from poste restante, got photos developed, stocked up from the supermarket, changed money and got passport photos taken. This seemed to take up most of the day.

                Didn't do a lot all day apart from lie by the pool. Phoned home briefly to wish Ayla Happy Birthday. Went to an Indian restaurant for tea.

                Spent the first half of the day lying by the pool. We had our final Kuta session in the evening. We started on the arak at 5ish and then spent a couple of hours drinking cheap beer in the "Bali Asli Happy Hour". We spent 20 minutes or so chatting to Dave, Cathy, etc on the Internet (they are in Dublin) and went for pizzas at another restaurant that we have visited regularly over the last few weeks. We found somewhere showing English football so had a few more beers there and returned to the room to round off the night with more arak. We got totally soaked walking back. The wet season started on Thursday and we have had quite a few storms since then. We walked most of the way back from Legian in the rain.

                A typical hangover day! It rained for most of the afternoon and evening but we managed to get out for pizzas twice between the showers.

                Our last day in Indonesia and it looks as if we have chosen the right time to leave as once again the weather was not good. We spent the morning by the pool and were taken by Perama to the airport at midday.

                We had two and a half hours to kill at the airport before our 15:05 Garuda flight to Singapore. The flight was on time and got us into Singapore at about 5:30. From the airport we got a bus and then the MRT into the city centre and checked into a hotel that we had pre-booked through Asia-Hotels.com

                After showers, we went out to make a few phone calls and had our first roti canai for six and a half weeks.
