                After breakfast, we went out looking for alternative places to stay. We found somewhere in between the Poppies Lanes with nicer rooms, a better pool, a better location and less than half the price. We booked a room and returned to Hotel Karthi to collect our luggage. We had a brief argument with the manager about service/room price and left at about 11. By midday we were by the pool and generally a lot happier with Kuta than 12 hours previously.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a couple of hours by the pool we set off to find out prices of airline tickets so we could plan what we are doing for our stay in Indonesia. We had quite a few options in mind but after finding out about flights, only one of our plans remained a realistic option. We will try and fly to Flores in about two weeks time, spend 3 - 4 weeks traveling back to Bali and leave Indonesia a couple of weeks earlier than planned. This will give us an extra couple of weeks to go to Thailand at the end of October.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the afternoon, we also collected mail from Poste Restante at Kuta Post Office. In the evening we got pissed, taking advantage of the cheap beer (50p a pint during happy hour) and the large "Jam Jar" cocktails served at The Bounty. I don't remember leaving The Bounty.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 3rd September</span>
                We did not have too bad hangovers but had a fairly quiet day anyway. We had hoped to sort out our flights but, today being a Sunday, we could not do a lot.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 4th September</span>
                We managed to book, pay for and collect our tickets to Maumere for Friday 15th. We also managed to move our Garuda flight back to Singapore forward by a couple of weeks as decided on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the rest of the day was spent lying by the pool or wandering round Kuta's shops and restaurants.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 5th September</span>
                We checked out of our hotel at midday and reserved a room as we intend to be back on Saturday. At 1, we got the shuttle to Padang Bai. This was a three hour journey involving a change of buses at Ubud. The bus dropped us outside the hotel we stayed at last time we were in Padang Bai and we checked into the room above the one we had before. We could not be bothered to go to the beach but were fortunate to catch the start of a ceremony that will apparently last for the next three days. We spent almost an hour watching the traditional dancing before is ended.

                Spent most of the day at the beach - the morning at the small beach that we used last time we were here and the afternoon at the main beach overlooking the harbour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                All day, there was a steady flow of people dressed in traditional costume walking to the temple on the hill overlooking the village. Once there, they sat around and preyed and left their offerings before leaving and walking down the hill again. No-one seemed to stay in Padang Bai. They turned up from all over Bali and then left again. we still don't really know what is going on but it is a very colourful sight and is reasonably interesting.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 7th September</span>
                A similar day to yesterday apart from the fact that we did not go to the beach in the afternoon. The ceremony continued but with far fewer people than yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 8th September</span>
                We checked out after breakfast and headed towards Selat from where we hope to climb Mt. Agung tomorrow morning. We had a few disagreements with the bemo drivers in Padang Bai which resulted in a change to our planned route but we still managed to get to Selat by about midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were not sure how we went about finding a guide for tomorrows climb and had no idea which way to go when we got dropped in Selat. However, we quickly found an office advertising trips and went in to speak to the guide. For Rp75,000 each, we joined a group consisting of five French students, who had arrived at the same time as us, and one other couple. We got taken to the only hotel in Selat and checked into a double room. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There was not a lot to do in Selat. We spent an hour or so walking around the area looking at rice terraces and the rest of the afternoon in the room. At 5:30, we were picked up by the guide who took us plus the French group to a restaurant about 5km away. We had a surprisingly good meal and were back for an early night by 7:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 9th September</span>
                The alarm went off at 1:20 and we were collected by our guide ten minutes later. We were joined at the guide's office by the other couple (Wayne and Susan from Birmingham) and were all driven up to the temple at the start of the walk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We began walking just after 2 and were aiming to get to the top for sun-rise. The first half of the climb was not too exciting. The path was steep through forest and quite hard work. By the halfway point, the group had been completely split up. The French students had gone ahead with the guide, we were lagging some way behind with the guide's assistant and Wayne & Susan had had to turn back as she was afraid of heights and was finding it all a bit hard going.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                From the halfway point to the top was also quite difficult but I found it a lot more enjoyable. There was no real path to follow but a lot of climbing up the side of the mountain. We eventually made it to the top by 7:15. We had missed the sunrise by an hour but the views from the top were superb anyway.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We all had tea and pot noodles at the top for breakfast. The French lot were well pissed off by this stage as they had been waiting over an hour!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The views on the way down were also excellent but once again, the walking was very hard going, particularly the last half. We got back to the car-park by 1pm, 2 hours later than expected - the bemo driver had been waiting since 9:30.
            </p>

                We were both completely knackered by the tie we got to Selat but we decided to head off immedeatly and try and get back to Kuta as soon as possible. We checked out of our room by 2 and went to stand by the main road hoping for a bemo going anywhere in the general direction of where we wanted to go. WE were not very hopeful but within about ten minutes, a bus came along that was heading to Dempasar. The driver told us that he would take us all the way to Kuta for Rp50,000 which seemed like a good deal all round. The journey was not particularly quick but by 5:30, we were back at Bali Sari Cottages.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It was a huge relief to remove our walking boots - they had been on our feet for 16 hours - and then get under a hot shower.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Feeling refreshed, we headed out for much needed food..... and the start of happy hours. We talked to Cathy and Ed in the chat room at 8:30 and continued drinking beer and Jam Jars until gone 1:30 (by which time we had been up for more than 24 hours).

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 10th September</span>
                We were pretty tired and hungover so did not do a lot all day. Our legs were in the same mess that they had been in after climbing Kinabalu so walking anywhere, particularly downhill was proving very painful.

                <span class="diary-date">Monday 11th September</span>
                Spent the day by the pool and the evening in a selection of Kuta's night spots - Bali Rock Cafe (Big Bopper Burger and Rubber Ducks), Peanuts (Jam Jars) and The Original Bounty (U.F.O.'s). We also had a few beers in a selection of quieter bars and returned to the room at about 1:30. Drank duty free Bacardi before falling asleep.

                We nearly missed breakfast as we did not wake up until 10:52 and could not find our key so were locked in. Otherwise, a quiet uneventful day spent lying by the pool and eating.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 13th September</span>
                Another quiet day. At lunchtime, we ahd a walk out to a supermarket and the post office. Roz reconfirmed Friday's flights and I had my hair cut. We went to a Mexican restaurant in the evening. An excellent, if not typically Indonesian, meal!

                Our last full day in Kuta before he head off into Nusa Tengarra and a similar day to yesterday. I posted Ayla's birthday present from the main post office and we sorted out books and money for the next few weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We discovered today that we are both going to have problems cashing travelers cheques on this trip. Roz dated all hers when she first received them which means that some places wont accept them. We had been trying to use as many as possible of her cheques as we found somewhere that was happy with them and gave good rates. However, today I tried to change my first one and was told that it could not be accepted as the signature did not match the one in my passport. We eventually found a place that would accept it but this could cause problems in the future. We also discovered that we no longer possess the travelers cheque receipt.
