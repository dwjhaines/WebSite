                We left Heathrow on time at midday and had a fairly uneventful flight to K.L. Arrived in K.L. at 7ish and had a three hour wait for our flight to Kuching. This flight was also on time and by 3:30 we had arrived at the Grand Continental Hotel, Kuching.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were all completely knackered but after a brief visit to the pool and much needed showers we went out to see the sights of Kuching.

                The sight-seeing trip consisted mainly of visits to Chinese restaurants which are the only establishments that seem to sell beer. We carried on drinking (mainly cans of Carlsberg) up until around midnight but no-one is sure exactly what time we got back to the hotel.

                We got up for breakfast at 10 but then returned to bed and slept until just after 1. There were no serious hangovers , so once we were up, we walked to the National Park office on the other side of town. We had hoped to book accommodation at three different parks. The person in the office could not make a booking for us but gave us a number which Roz rang to book all three. We stopped for lunch on the way back to the hotel and then spent an hour by the pool.

                After breakfast, we got a taxi to the airport and got the 9:10 flight to Bintulu. From Bintulu we had planned to travel to Similajau, a beach national park. However, it had been raining steadily all morning so we had a change of plan and decided to go to the Niah Caves a day early. Roz phoned up from the airport to alter the accommodation booking and we eventually got in a minibus for the two hour journey to Batu Niah. From Batu Niah, it was a short taxi ride to the national park where we checked into a four bed hostel room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The rain had not really stopped but at 2:30, we headed off to look at the caves. It took about an hour in each direction to look at the caves and we spent a couple of hours walking around them. The caves were more impressive than I had expected them to be and it was an enjoyable afternoon despite the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There were not too much in the way of facilities at the place we were staying so we had tea in the restaurant and returned to the room.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 26th July</span>
                We decided against a second day at Niah and headed instead to Miri. We got a boat up the river to Batu Niah and then the 9:00 bus to Miri. The journey was about two hours and by lunchtime we had checked into a hotel, a short walk from the bus station. As the weather was good, we decided to go to "Hawaii Beach" about 45 minutes from Miri. During the bus journey out to the beach the weather deteriorated rapidly and by the time we were there, it was wet, windy and generally unsuitable for lying in the sun. We spent about ten minutes standing around doing nothing and then got the same bus back to Miri.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As we had a spare day and there was not much to do in Miri, we started drinking as soon as we were back in the hotel at about 2:30. We got through most of a bottle of Bacardi before going out drinking in the Chinese restaurants. Had an excellent curry for tea as well as a couple of other meals during the session. Got back to the hotel at around 12.

                Didn't do a lot all day apart from eat, sleep and watch videos. We did manage to phone up and book accommodation for the walk up Kinabalu next week.

                We got up at 7 and walked to the bus station stopping for breakfast on the way. From the bus station, we got a taxi out to Miri aiport for the 9:20 flight to Mulu. The flight was in a Twin Otter plane which only held about 20 people. The flight was only 35 minutes but due to the low altitude was quite spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had checked into a room in the national park by midday and at 1:30 set off to see a couple of the show caves. We walked to Deer Cave and Long Cave both of which were pretty spectacular. We had beaten the tour groups up there so had both of them to ourselves for most of the time we were there. By 3:30 we were out of the caves and had a two hour wait to see the millions of bats that live in the cave exit for their nights feeding. This was an incredible sight and we spent about 4 5 minutes watching the swarms (?) of bats leaving the cave.

                It was a two mile walk back to our rooms. As with Niah, there was not much else to do so we had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 29th July</span>
                Had breakfast at 8 and then set off to see the remaining two show caves in the national park. the walk to the first was just over 3km but was a much harder walk than yesterday with a lot more steps to climb. The walk was quite enjoyable but we were all soaked in sweat by the time we reached Wind Cave. Wind Cave was the best of the caves we have seen in Borneo with plenty of typical cave features all brightly lit up. From there, we walked to Clear Water Cavewhich was also pretty solid but none of us took the option of going in the swimming pool at the foot of the steps to the cave. We had managed to keep ahead of most of the tour groups again and left Clear Water as most of them were setting up their picnic lunches.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the park H.Q. getting totally soaked on the way back due to a tropical downpour. The rain if anything made the walk back easier but it did not do a lot for the washing that we had hung out prior to our walk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a brief break in the rain during the afternoon during which time we managed to sun-bathe for about 30 minutes but spent most of the rest of the day reading and trying to work out how to dry all our clothes before we leave tomorrow.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 30th July</span>
                Had breakfast at the park canteen again and then got in a minibus for the short trip to Mulu airport. We were due to fly to Miri at 10:40 and arrived at the airport with about an hour to spare. An "extra flight" left for Miri at about 10:30 and at 10:45 we were told that our flight was canceled for technical reasons. It was obvious that our plane had been used to carry a group of people to Miri (whose flight had been canceled yesterday) but the Malaysia Airlines bloke would not admit this. We were told that a later flight was also canceled and at this point had no idea whether or not we were going to get away from Mulu today.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a lot of discussion and phone calls to Miri, another "extra flight" was announced and we were told that we could leave at 3:40. We had no option but to accept this and sat around waiting. At 1:30, we were told that the 14:05, which had been canceled, was now leaving on time and we could have the last three seats.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually landed in Miri just after 3 but had missed our connecting flight to Lawas (we did not know if this had been canceled as well but either way, we could not catch it). There was more standing around in front of the Malaysian Airlines check-in counter until someone told us we could have seats to Lawas in 15 minutes time on the 3:45 flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually arrived in Lawas at about 4:30. The fact that we were only about an hour late was incredible considering the confusion earlier in the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                From the airport at Lawas we got quite a good deal on a taxi to Sipitang in Sabah, our intended destination for the day. On arrival in Sipitang we got anther taxi and managed to get all the way to Beaufort. We checked into a hotel for the night and had another relatively quiet night.

                We were up at 7, had breakfast and then walked the 300m to Beaufort railway atation. We had reserved seats on teh Beaufort - Tenom scenic railway journey. The journey was in a 13 seat "railcar" which was not much bigger than a mini-bus. The journey was quite interesting without being as spectacular as Lonely Planet made out, The highlight was probably the railcar itself.

                We arrived in Tenom at 10:00 and got straight into a minibus bound for Keningau which was on the way to Kota Kinabalu, today's destination. At Keningau we got straight onto another bus but had to sit watching the usual selection of crap videos for two hours until the bus finally departed for KK.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey to KK went through a mountain range where the road was over 6000 ft above sea level in places. It was at least as spectacular as the train journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking into a hotel, we checked on buses to the Kinabalu National Park for tomorrow and then spent an hour or so in an internet cafe checking e-mail, etc.

                We did not have a lot to do this morning as we were waiting for the 2pm bus to Kinabalu National Park. We walked out to the HSBC Bank and spent the rest of the morning planning what to do in our last week in Borneo and making the most of the hotel's air-conditioning. We killed a couple of hours in a restaurant at lunchtime and then boarded the bus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the park at 4ish and spent about 20 minutes checking in and sorting out climbing permits, etc. Once in the hostel we had the fun of sorting out rucksacks for tomorrow's walk. Not much else to do in the park apart from lying around waiting for the walk to start. Stocked up on Cadbury's Dairy Milk and peanuts.

                We were up before 7 and headed to the park canteen for breakfast. We put our luggage in the luggage room at park HQ and then managed to get five other people together to form a group of eight. We hired a guide between us and set off by bus to "the power station" which is at the start of the walk. As well as us in the group was an English couple, an English bloke on his own and a German with a Chinese girlfriend.

                We started walking at 8:15. The group all seemed to be similarly matched in walking ability apart from the English bloke who was obviously fitter than everyone else but seemed content to walk at the back. The walk was quite enjoyable but reasonably hard work. Most of the climbing was done by walking up steps - 2,500 in total. Where there were no steps, we had to climb up the path of rocks but there was nothing too difficult. There were "pondoks" every 30 minutes or so with drinking water which made things a lot easier. In total, we climbed from 1,800m to Laban Rata at 3,300m. We arrived at Laban Rata just before 1, had lunch and then continued to our accommodation a few minutes further up the mountain.

                The accommodation was basic and had no heating or hot water. After cold showers, we spent the rest of the day sat around looking at the rain, drinking boiling water to try and get warm. We did not want to walk down to the restaurant at Laban Rata as we could not risk getting our only sets of clothes wet so we survived the afternoon on crisps, biscuits and hula hoops. The hostel filled up gradually during the afternoon and by 8pm, most of our group was tucked up in bed.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 3rd August</span>
                People in the hostel started getting up at about 1:20 am and our group was all up about an hour later. At 2:50, the eight of us plus Gearoge, our guide set off to walk to the summit.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The walking today was much more difficult than it had been yesterday. The steps were steeper, it was totally dark and the altitude made breathing difficult. We spent about 45 minutes going up steps before we came to the ropes. The next 45 minutes were spent mainly hauling ourselves up the mountain with the aid of ropes which are fixed to the granite slopes to help climbers. This was probably the hardest part of the whole climb as two hands were needed on the ropes which made holding torches just about impossible. We reached Sayat Sayat by 4:20 with supposedly just an hours walk ahead of us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The last part of the walk saw the rest of the group go on ahead of us. Dave was having increasing breathing difficulties and Roz was also finding the going tough. There were still ropes guiding us towards the summit but these were mainly to keep us going in the right direction as opposed to being essential to get up the slopes. The aim of the walk was to get to the summit by sun-rise and we all just about made it, getting to the top at exactly 6am
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There were about 50 people huddled together at the top and the next half hour was spent taking pictures and generally being relieved that the climb was over. The sky was almost totally clear by the time the sun rose and the views in all directions were superb.  We had been lucky with the weather all the way. Although it was cold at the top, the wind was no-where near as strong as we had been led to believe it would be and it had also been dry for most of the time we were walking.

                We started our descent at 6:30. We had an hour stop at Laban Rata to collect our rucksacks and eat breakfast. We left Laban Rata by 9:30 and were back at the power station by about 12:30. The walk down was easier but by the time we were at the bottom, all our knees were beginning to suffer from the constant steps.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were picked up by bus and driven back to park HQ. By this time, any leg movement was difficult and going down steps was almost impossible.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We collected our certificates and together with Claire and Andy, the English couple, we got a minibus to Poring for a visit to the hot springs.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were in dormitory accommodation for the third night running. We put our stuff in the dorm and went straight into the hot baths. The baths were for 1 or 2 people and were filled with sulpherous hot water. We spent a couple of hours recovering either in or just outside the baths. The baths were not brilliant but it was an ideal way of spending the afternoon following the climb
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                All eight people in our dorm had just done the walk and by about 9pm everyone was asleep.

                We got up at 7:30 (having decided not to visit the canopy walkway at 6:30) and got a minibus into Ranau, still with Claire and Andy. We had breakfast in Ranau and then got another minibus to Sepilok, a journey that lasted three and a half hours. At Sepilok, the bus dropped us at The Jungle Resort just outside the Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. We could not walk any great distance as our legs had all stiffened up so we checked into a room for three at the resort.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 2, we walked to the rehabilitation centre to see the afternoon feeding session. We were all having serious problems walking up or down steps but could just about cope with walking on flat roads. The feeding session was superb, probably better than the ones we had seen in Bukit Lawang in Indonesia. There were 7 - 8 orangutans on the feeding platform and three of them walked across the viewing platform and happily posed for pictures along the way. When the orangutans had finished, a group of wild monkeys moved in to eat the leftovers.

                After an hour or so of sitting in the sun, we caught the bus to Sandakan, 25km away. There is not a lot to do in Sandakan but it had been a while since the last session and Sandakan seemed as good a place as any.

                We started off in Chinese restaurants at about 4. We had a few pints by the time we ate at 7 but then all the Chinese restaurants shut for the night and we were left with no-where to drink. We found an open supermarket and bought orange juice, soft drinks and ice and returned to the room where we consumed another litre of duty free spirits. It worked out quite well in the end as we could drink, play cards and listen to the sport program on World Service.

                We had breakfast and then returned to bed until checkout at 12:00. We got a taxi out to the bus station and sat around waiting for the 2pm bus back to KK (we had booked tickets yesterday). The bus journey back took six hours but was not too bad as it was a big comfortable air-conditioned bus with plenty of leg room.

                We checked out of our hotel at 8:30 and walked down to the waterfront where we had planned to get the 9am ferry to Manukan island. When we got to the ferry office, we found that not only was there not a 9am ferry, but all of todays ferries had been canceled for no apparent reason. We chartered a boat to take us out to the island for RM10 each, which is what we had expected to pay anyway, and were at the island at 9:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had pre-booked accommodation on the island for two nights. It is the most expensive place we have stayed so far but for RM161 we have got a two storey "chalet" with two bedrooms and a large living area all within a couple of minutes walk from an excellent beach. We spent just over an hour lying in the sun and swimming before returning to the chalet for most of the afternoon.

                For the first time on the trip, we had a whole day with absolutely nothing to do. It was also the first day since climbing Kinabalu that our legs had returned to normal. There is nothing to do on Manukan so we spent the morning and part of the afternoon lying on the beach and  swimming and spent the rest of the day lazing around the chalet reading, etc.

We arrived in Kota Bharu at 4:20 and got a taxi to the Perdana Hotel where we had arranged to meet. We had an hour or so by the pool and then went out to find places selling beer for tomorrow night.

                I felt pretty rough in the taxi and by the time we got to Merang I just felt like lying down on my bed for the rest of the day. We got two rooms in the Kembara Resort and I did spend most of the remainder of the day laid on the bed. We listened to the first day of the football season on World Service from 10pm until the results at midnight.

                A session was called for the evening as yesterdays planned session was postponed due to me not feeling well. We started on the duty free at 5:30, ate food from the night market and then carried on drinking until about 3am. The whole session took place in Regan and Annette's room as there is nowhere at all in Merang where we could drink our own alcohol let alone buy any more. I was still not feeling at my best so did not drink as much as the others but we still managed to drink 3½ litres of spirits between the five of us.

We had about 30 minutes to wait for the bus and the journey took about an hour. By 2 we had checked into a hotel.

                We decided against the beach today as not only was the weather bad but we all seem to be covered in sand-fly bites from yesterday. At midday we got the bus into Kuantan with Colin who is departing for Penang. We got out money, stocked up at the supermarket and said or goodbyes to Colin. We also looked at a couple of hotels as we are not really sure of our plans for the next week and staying a few nights in Kuantan is one of our options. We had planned to stay at Cherating until next Monday but the poor beach (sand-flies and jellyfish) together with the fact that the nightlife is not all that Lonely Planet makes it out to be, means that we could do with leaving sooner and doing something else for a week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we drank the brandy we had bought in Kuantan and also spent about four hours drinking beer in a Chinese restaurant. (I was sick towards the end of the evening, the second time in just over a week) Most of the evening was spent discussing possible itineraries for the next week. A short trip to Thailand was a popular option.

We got on the bus to Kuantan at 6:20 and arrived in Kuantan at 7:50, ten minutes before the Melaka bus was due to leave. We got straight in a taxi which got us to the express bus station with a couple of minutes to spare. The journey to Melaka was fairly uninteresting and took six and a half hours.

However, there was no-one to meet us and it took about 45 minutes and a phone call from tourist information before someone turned up for us. We were not happy by this time and the fact that the hotel was not very good or ideally located did not make the matters any better!
