                We left Heathrow on time at midday and had a fairly uneventful flight to K.L. Arrived in K.L. at 7ish and had a three hour wait for our flight to Kuching. This flight was also on time and by 3:30 we had arrived at the Grand Continental Hotel, Kuching.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were all completely knackered but after a brief visit to the pool and much needed showers we went out to see the sights of Kuching.

                The sight-seeing trip consisted mainly of visits to Chinese restaurants which are the only establishments that seem to sell beer. We carried on drinking (mainly cans of Carlsberg) up until around midnight but no-one is sure exactly what time we got back to the hotel.

                We got up for breakfast at 10 but then returned to bed and slept until just after 1. There were no serious hangovers , so once we were up, we walked to the National Park office on the other side of town. We had hoped to book accommodation at three different parks. The person in the office could not make a booking for us but gave us a number which Roz rang to book all three. We stopped for lunch on the way back to the hotel and then spent an hour by the pool.

                Before going out to tea in the evening, we visited the Big Cat statue, the first sight we have made any effort to see.

                After breakfast, we got a taxi to the airport and got the 9:10 flight to Bintulu. From Bintulu we had planned to travel to Similajau, a beach national park. However, it had been raining steadily all morning so we had a change of plan and decided to go to the Niah Caves a day early. Roz phoned up from the airport to alter the accommodation booking and we eventually got in a minibus for the two hour journey to Batu Niah. From Batu Niah, it was a short taxi ride to the national park where we checked into a four bed hostel room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The rain had not really stopped but at 2:30, we headed off to look at the caves. It took about an hour in each direction to look at the caves and we spent a couple of hours walking around them. The caves were more impressive than I had expected them to be and it was an enjoyable afternoon despite the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There were not too much in the way of facilities at the place we were staying so we had tea in the restaurant and returned to the room.

                We decided against a second day at Niah and headed instead to Miri. We got a boat up the river to Batu Niah and then the 9:00 bus to Miri. The journey was about two hours and by lunchtime we had checked into a hotel, a short walk from the bus station. As the weather was good, we decided to go to "Hawaii Beach" about 45 minutes from Miri. During the bus journey out to the beach the weather deteriorated rapidly and by the time we were there, it was wet, windy and generally unsuitable for lying in the sun. We spent about ten minutes standing around doing nothing and then got the same bus back to Miri.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As we had a spare day and there was not much to do in Miri, we started drinking as soon as we were back in the hotel at about 2:30. We got through most of a bottle of Bacardi before going out drinking in the Chinese restaurants. Had an excellent curry for tea as well as a couple of other meals during the session. Got back to the hotel at around 12.

                Didn't do a lot all day apart from eat, sleep and watch videos. We did manage to phone up and book accommodation for the walk up Kinabalu next week.

                We got up at 7 and walked to the bus station stopping for breakfast on the way. From the bus station, we got a taxi out to Miri aiport for the 9:20 flight to Mulu. The flight was in a Twin Otter plane which only held about 20 people. The flight was only 35 minutes but due to the low altitude was quite spectacular.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had checked into a room in the national park by midday and at 1:30 set off to see a couple of the show caves. We walked to Deer Cave and Long Cave both of which were pretty spectacular. We had beaten the tour groups up there so had both of them to ourselves for most of the time we were there. By 3:30 we were out of the caves and had a two hour wait to see the millions of bats that live in the cave exit for their nights feeding. This was an incredible sight and we spent about 4 5 minutes watching the swarms (?) of bats leaving the cave.

                It was a two mile walk back to our rooms. As with Niah, there was not much else to do so we had an early night.

                Had breakfast at 8 and then set off to see the remaining two show caves in the national park. the walk to the first was just over 3km but was a much harder walk than yesterday with a lot more steps to climb. The walk was quite enjoyable but we were all soaked in sweat by the time we reached Wind Cave. Wind Cave was the best of the caves we have seen in Borneo with plenty of typical cave features all brightly lit up. From there, we walked to Clear Water Cavewhich was also pretty solid but none of us took the option of going in the swimming pool at the foot of the steps to the cave. We had managed to keep ahead of most of the tour groups again and left Clear Water as most of them were setting up their picnic lunches.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the park H.Q. getting totally soaked on the way back due to a tropical downpour. The rain if anything made the walk back easier but it did not do a lot for the washing that we had hung out prior to our walk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a brief break in the rain during the afternoon during which time we managed to sun-bathe for about 30 minutes but spent most of the rest of the day reading and trying to work out how to dry all our clothes before we leave tomorrow.
