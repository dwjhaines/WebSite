                I woke up with a bad case of the runs. I did not feel too bad so after breakfast, we caught a bus to Chiang Rai as planned. By the time we had walked to our hotel, I had started to feel ill and had a slight temperature. After lying down for an hour, we went out for lunch and a walk around town. We were back in the room by 4:30 by which time I felt pretty rough and my temperature had got a lot worse. Apart from a brief trip out for Roz to have tea, I spent the rest of the day in bed.

                Woke up feeling a lot better than yesterday but still with the runs. We walked to the bus station and got the 8:00 bus to Chiang Mai. The journey took three hours and we were dropped on the outskirts of town. We got a tuk-tuk to a hotel that we had pre-booked on the Internet, stopping at the train station en-route to buy tickets for next Tuesday.

                The hotel was a former "top-end" hotel but we had managed to get a room for Baht700 a night. We spent a  couple of hours at the pool and then went out for our first look around Chiang Mai. We walked out to the night bazaar and ate at McDonalds (my first food for 24 hours). We walked round a few of the stalls and stopped at a few book and souvenir shops on our way back to the hotel.
