                I woke up with a bad case of the runs. I did not feel too bad so after breakfast, we caught a bus to Chiang Rai as planned. By the time we had walked to our hotel, I had started to feel ill and had a slight temperature. After lying down for an hour, we went out for lunch and a walk around town. We were back in the room by 4:30 by which time I felt pretty rough and my temperature had got a lot worse. Apart from a brief trip out for Roz to have tea, I spent the rest of the day in bed.

                Woke up feeling a lot better than yesterday but still with the runs. We walked to the bus station and got the 8:00 bus to Chiang Mai. The journey took three hours and we were dropped on the outskirts of town. We got a tuk-tuk to a hotel that we had pre-booked on the Internet, stopping at the train station en-route to buy tickets for next Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The hotel was a former "top-end" hotel but we had managed to get a room for Baht700 a night. We spent a  couple of hours at the pool and then went out for our first look around Chiang Mai. We walked out to the night bazaar and ate at McDonalds (my first food for 24 hours). We walked round a few of the stalls and stopped at a few book and souvenir shops on our way back to the hotel.

                In the evening, we went back to the night bazaar again, stopping for tea on the way.

                I was just about 100% recovered today. We spent the morning by the pool, continued our souvenir shopping after lunch (McDonalds again) and started the session at about 6pm.

                We had a couple of beers in a bar near the hotel and then walked to The Red Lion for a wheat beer. We started on Mehkong at The Riverside Restaurant and continued in an Australian bar while watching the football. We made it back to the hotel for final score but it is only a vague memory!

                A quiet day due to hangovers. In the evening we ate at The Riverside again and then watched Sunderland v Bradford at The Red Lion.

                We hadn't planned a session but ended up quite pissed by the time we got home and decided to finish last night's Mehkong.

                Another day spent not doing a lot although we did manage to visit the wat that is just round the corner from the hotel. We also posted another parcel home containing everything that we had bought from the night market.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went for our 11th anniversary pizza. We had a few beers, and a litre of Italian wine and finished off the evening with another bottle of Mehkong back at the hotel.

                We checked out of the hotel at midday and had a couple of hours to kill before heading to the station to begin our trip to Cambodia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour on the Internet and then went for another excellent Italian meal for lunch (food has certainly been a highlight of Chiang Mai).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Just after 2, we got a tuk-tuk out to the station and boarded the 3:30 train to Bangkok. It was a fairly uneventful journey - our beds were made up at 9ish although it was a lot hotter than on previous trains we had been on and I didn't really sleep until after 2:30.
