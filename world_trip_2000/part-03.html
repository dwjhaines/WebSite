                We wanted to leave Singapore as early as possible so we could get a reasonable way towards Thailand by the end fo the day. At the start of the day we had no real plan, just to keep traveling North until we had had enough.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of things to sort out before leaving Singapore which involved trips to the post office and the Malaysian Airlines office but we managed to check out of the hotel by 10:00. We caught a local bus to Johor Bharu. By the tie we had gone through two sets of passport control and got back onto buses, this journey took almost two hours. There were no immediate buses to Butterworth so we got the 12:30 to K.L.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got into K.L. by 6 and decided on the overnight train journey to Hat Yai just the other side of the Thai border. After eating, we walked out to the station and boarded the 9pm train.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 18th October</span>
                We had a reasonable nights sleep in our sleeping compartments and arrived at the Thai border at about 10am. We cleared both sets of customs and continued on to Hat Yai where we arrived at 11am Thai time (-1 hour).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided by this time that we had done enough traveling and checked into a hotel for the night. We went out for lunch and booked mini-bus tickets to Samui for tomorrow. Spent the rest of the afternoon by the hotel pool.
