                We wanted to leave Singapore as early as possible so we could get a reasonable way towards Thailand by the end fo the day. At the start of the day we had no real plan, just to keep traveling North until we had had enough.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of things to sort out before leaving Singapore which involved trips to the post office and the Malaysian Airlines office but we managed to check out of the hotel by 10:00. We caught a local bus to Johor Bharu. By the tie we had gone through two sets of passport control and got back onto buses, this journey took almost two hours. There were no immediate buses to Butterworth so we got the 12:30 to K.L.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got into K.L. by 6 and decided on the overnight train journey to Hat Yai just the other side of the Thai border. After eating, we walked out to the station and boarded the 9pm train.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 18th October</span>
                We had a reasonable nights sleep in our sleeping compartments and arrived at the Thai border at about 10am. We cleared both sets of customs and continued on to Hat Yai where we arrived at 11am Thai time (-1 hour).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided by this time that we had done enough traveling and checked into a hotel for the night. We went out for lunch and booked mini-bus tickets to Samui for tomorrow. Spent the rest of the afternoon by the hotel pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 19th October</span>
                We left Had Yai by mini-bus at about 9:30, an hour after getting on the bus. The journey to Surat Thani took about four and a half hours. We had been told that we would be taken directly to the vehicle ferry but still ended up being dropped in Surat Thani. We got taken out to the ferry pier on anohter bus and the ferry eventually left at 5pm - 3 hours later than the time we had been told. We got to Samui at 6:45 and got a taxi directly to Weekender.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers we went for a few wheat beers and then got pissed on Mehkong in Will Wait, Rising Sun and Bikers & Rockers. Pong's had closed for a month so we had to eat elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 20th October</span>
                Spent most of the day around either in the room or by the pool. Weather was surprisingly good considering it is supposed to be the wet season but there are not many people around. Had the pool to ourselves most of the time we were there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 21st October</span>
                Another day by the pool. We watched Man U. v Leeds at 5:30 and then went to the Austrian bar for schnitzels and wheat beer. We were supposed to "chat" to Dave, Cathy, etc at 9 (as they are in Munich) but Regan got the time wrong so it is postponed until tomorrow. Instead we continued with the football and Mehkong session watching Liverpool v Leicester in Bauhaus and Newcastle v Everton in The Rising Sun. Don't remember getting back to Weekender.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 22nd October</span>
                We booked bus tickets to Krabi for Tuesday morning before the temptation to stay in Samui became too great. In the evening we did manage to chat to everyone in Munich but the connection at the German end was slow so it was not as successful as on previous attempts. Watched Villa v Sunderland at Bauhaus, our fourth game of the weekend.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 23rd October</span>
                Spent the morning by the pool. The weather deteriorated in the afternoon so we wrote postcards, sent e-mail, read, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to have a few wheat beers and visited the Austrian bar (for the final time on this visit to Samui) in the evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 24th October</span>
                Got up at 6 with slight hangovers from last night. We had breakfast and left the hotel by 6:45. We got a pickup truck into Na Thon and boarded a bus which drove us about 50m to the ferry pier. The vehicle ferry left on time at 8, we were back on the bus the other side by 9:45 and dropped in Surat Thani at 11. We then got another bus all the way to Krabi and a pick up truck out to Ao Nang Beach where we arrived at 4:30. The whole journey had taken ten hours which once again, seemed to be a lot longer than it should have done given the distances involved.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 25th October</span>
                Another early start as we had to be at the dive shop - ten minutes walk away - by 7:45. After sorting out our equipment, we had a ten minute journey in a pick-up truck followed by five minutes in a long-tail boat to reach the boat that was to take us to Phi Phi. The diving boat was fairly large for the number of people on it so it was an enjoyable journey out to the dive site at Phi Phi taking about two and a half hours.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip included two dives and lunch. The first dive gave us our first view of sharks and the second one had some of the most spectacular coral we have seen so far. When not diving, we could sun-bathe on the boat - it was the first sunny day in this area for weeks - and all in all, it was an excellent day out.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped back in Ao Nang just after 6pm

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday 26th October</span>
                After breakfast, we checked out of our hotel and got a long-tail boat out to Rai Leh beach. The beach is on the mainland but is only accessible by boat. We got dropped at West Rai Leh and checked into a bungalow right on the beach, a few metres from the sea at high tide. The beach here is definitely one of the best beaches we have ever been to. We spent the morning on West Rai Leh and in the afternoon walked to Hat Tham Phra Nang which was also spectacular but probably not quite as nice
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                The food here is a lot more expensive than some parts of Thailand but is just as good value so all in all it seems an excellent place to spend a couple of days. We will definitely come back in December!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 27th October</span>
                Spent just about the whole day lying on the beach.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 28th October</span>
                We left Rai Leh by long-tail boat just after 9 and were dropped in Krabi about 35 minutes later. We were heading towards Penang in Malaysia but planned to stop overnight in Alor Setar to break up the journey. We got a pick-up truck out to the bus station and got the 10:20 bus to Had Yai. We had decided not to use the Sang Serm minibus service and go by public transport. We had to stand for the first couple of hours but otherwise the plan seemed to be working.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Had Yai, we were not sure if there was going to be a train running to Alor Setar so we decided not to bother going to the station and to head for the border instead. The price of the pick-up to the station seemed too high - if we had paid, we would have caught the train. Our second set back was that we were told to get on a bus to Padang Besar and this bus then spent 40 minutes circling Had Yai before passing the bus station again and heading for the border. If we had been told to get the bus from outside the bus station we would have been on an earlier bus and saved ourselves 40 minutes. If this had happened, we would have caught up with the train at Padang Besar and still made it to Alor Setar.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually got to Padang Besar at about 5:20 and walked through both sets of border control into Malaysia. By this time we had missed the train and the last bus had also gone. The only hotel was not ideal so we eventually had to pay someone RM30 to drive us to Kangor, 32km away. We arrived there at 8ish (Malaysia time) and managed to find a hotel for the night. We went out for tea (our first food since breakfast) and returned to the room to listen to the football.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 29th October</span>
                Got up at 7, walked to the bus station and got the 8:00 bus to Butterworth. We had the usual half hour stop for no apparent reason just outside Butterworth and eventually arrived at about 10:45.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had our first roti canai of the day and then caught the ferry across to Georgetown and checked into the Grand Continental Hotel (pre-booked with asia-hotels.com again).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After an hour or so by the pool, we went for a walk around Georgetown. Rain put a stop to our planned sight-seeing but we spent some time using the Internet and spent the rest of the afternoon looking round the shops.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had not planned on a session but I was keen on a few drinks so we bought a bottle of brandy which we drank in the room and also went out for a few beers. Ended up fairly pissed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Monday 30th October</span>
                We checked out of the room at midday, left our luggage and went to sort out amongst other things, our flights from Samui to K.L. for next March. we managed to find the Pelangi Air office but they were unable to sell us the ticket as it is apparently a charted flight. We tried to get in touch with the travel agency who should be able to issue the ticket but this did not prove too successful either. We eventually gave up and went to play with the Internet instead.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got back to the hotel by about 3:30 and spent an hour by the pool before showering, collecting our luggage and getting a taxi to the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Penang for K.L. at 7:40 and left K.L. for Cairns at 10:35.
