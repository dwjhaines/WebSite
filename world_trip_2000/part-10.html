                At 9, we shared a taxi with two Americans who were in the same hotel as us out to Hanoi airport. Our plane left just about on time at 11:30 and by 1pm we were back in a hotel in the centre of Vientiane.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to head South towards Pakse tomorrow but we started having doubts about this journey today. By the time we had got to Vientiane we were just about 50-50 about staying in Laos or heading straight back into Thailand. The 15 hour bus journey to Pakse did not particularly appeal and we were not convinced that the sights of Southern Laos  were worth the effort involved in getting to them. After a lot of thought,  we selected a route through Thailand that will include a couple of nights in Sukhothai, the weekend in Bangkok and will mean getting to Ko Tao next Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had made up our minds about what we were doing, it was 5 o'clock. We used the Internet and then went to watch the sunset again - it was not as good as six weeks ago!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Nazeems for our evening meal and were joined by the two Americans from this mornings taxi. They were both quite pissed and it was quite an entertaining evening. (Roz felt ill again and didn't eat much).

                After breakfast at the Scandinavian Bakery, we checked out of our hotel and got a tuk-tuk out to the Friendship Bridge. We exited Laos, crossed the bridge by shuttle bus and re-entered Thailand. We got another tuk-tuk into Nong Kai, stopped at a bank to change money and then got the 11:20 bus to Khon Kaen. There was no real reason for going to Khon Kaen apart from the fact that it was a suitable stopping point on our way to Sukhothai. We arrived in Khon Kaen at about 2:45 and checked into a hotel fairly close to the bus station.
            </p>

                We checked out of the hotel at 7 and walked back to the bus station. We got the 8 o'clock bus for Sukhothai and had an uneventful seven hour journey. WE checked into a hotel in "New Sukhothai" and had another afternoon with not a lot to do.

                We were up before 6 to make a start at the Sukhothai ruins. We got the "bus" out to the old city and hired bikes to get us around the sites. We entered the park at about 7:30.

                We spent about three and a half hours cycling round the temples and were both more impressed than we'd expected to be. We went round just about all of the Lonely Planet highlights and stopped at a few others along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had finished our sight-seeing by 11 and got straight on a bus back to our hotel. The timing was all ideal as we only wanted to spend one night in Sukhothai and we were back in time to check-out by midday. It was a one hour bus ride to Phitsanulok and, after checking into a hotel and visiting KFC for lunch, we continued our sight-seeing. The Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat was very impressive but the Buddha-casting foundry was less impressive.

                After a breakfast of chicken curry and roti, we got on the 9:15 bus to Bangkok. The journey took exactly five hours and was one of the most comfortable bus journeys of the trip so far. We got a taxi straight from the bus station to The Asia Hotel where we discovered that they did not have our reservation. I had to go and get a print out of our e-mail confirmation before they would let us check in. By the time this was all sorted out, it was about 3:30. We had an hour or so by the pool before heading off to McDonalds for a very late lunch.

                We had our first session for two and a half weeks starting with a couple of beers in the room. We had a bottle of Mehkong with our evening meal and another in in a bar on the way back to the hotel. We were back in the room to listen to the football results but  only vaguely remember things by this stage.

                We both had hangovers due to last night's session. In the morning I got a boat out to the train station and booked tickets through to Samui for tomorrow night. I walked from there to the post office to collect mail and then got another boat to Banglampu. On Khao San Road, I bought flags for Colin and then got the bus back to Siam Square area where I met Roz in McDonalds. After an hour using the Internet we slept for most of the remainder of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we returned to the same place that we ate at last night and where we had also eaten on our last two holidays in Thailand!

                We got up at 7 to go on a final sight-seeing tour around some of the places in Bangkok that we had not seen previously. We started off at Wat Saket/Golden Mount which was quite good - very good views of Bangkok. After that, we went to a couple of other temples stopping at Khao San Road for breakfast and finally the City Pillar.

                We arrived in Surat Thani at 9:00, almost three hours late. This did not seem much of a problem at first as the Song Serm bus was still at the station to meet us and to take us to the ferry pier. However, at the ferry pier we were told that due to the late arrival of the train, we had missed our boat and would be going on the vehicle ferry at 4pm, arriving in Samui at 5:30. As every time given by Song Serm has been wrong, we assumed that this meant getting in after 7 and we decided to try and get there on our own.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started on the 4km walk back to the main road and managed to hitch a lift after about 10 minutes. We got a bus along the main road to the Don Sak turning. We got on another bus within a few minutes that would have taken us all the way to the ferry pier but the conductor tried to rip us off so we got off after a couple of miles. At this point we were fairly lucky as we got another lift almost immedeatly which took us directly to the pier in time for the 12:00 ferry. By 2, we were back in Samui. We got a songthaew to Lamai and checked into Weekender.

                We had a few hours by the pool and then walked out to the "Easy Divers" office for details of trips to Koh Tao.

                We went to Landhaus for a few wheat beers and our evening meal and then proceeded to The Rising Sun and Bikers and Rockers. I don't remember being in the second of these two bars!

                Slept all morning, lay by the pool in the afternoon. We booked ourselves a 10 dive package to Koh Tao starting from tomorrow morning. (We had tried to stay at a place on Koh Tao recommended by the owner of Landhaus but they were full)

                We were picked up by Easy Divers at 7:10 and taken to their pier at Big Buddha Beach. We got their speed boat out to Koh Tao and arrived there at about 9:30. After sorting out the paperwork at the dive office we were shown to our accommodation. After lunch we returned to the office for our first dives.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The diving was pretty good and we were pleased to find out that we had not forgotten everything that we had learnt from our previous dives. The dive sites were both close to the islands port so there was no long boat trip. We dived at two different sites and were back at the island by 6.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we booked a couple of nights at the place recommended to us on the other side of the island starting on Sunday. We had an excellent Italian meal and an early night.

                We did four dives today on two separate boat trips. First we went by speedboat out to Sail Rock and The S.W. Pinnacles - both excellent dive sites. After lunch, we went to Mango Bay on Koh Tao for two shallower dives. Both trips were very enjoyable - good diving and boats with not too many people on them.

We had lunch in the Easy Divers restaurant (now run by Paul, the scouser who had been in the ambulance with us when Caty had her accident) and then got a pick-up truck to Tanote Bay on the other side of the island.

                We had planned to go to Koh Phangan today and stay there a couple of days before returning to Samui. However, we had enjoyed diving with Easy Divers so decided to stay on Koh Tao a few more days and do another four dives. The diving is very good, it is as cheap as we are likely to ever get it and it is our last chance to dive before going home.

                We arrived in Samui at about 2:30. We could not be bothered to go to Lamai so checked into a hotel in Na Thon again.

                We were not in any hurry to get to Lamai as it was raining again so we stayed in Na Thon until just after midday. We got a songthaew to Lamai and checked into Weekender for the fifth time in the last eight months.

                We didn't do a lot for the rest of the day due to the weather. We had a few beers in our room before heading to Landhaus for food and wheat beer. We watched the football in The Rising Sun and I vaguely remember phoning Cathy on the way home.

                The rain continued all day. We didn't do a lot until our hangovers had cleared. With nothing else to do, we started drinking again at 5ish. We had a couple of beers in Will Wait and a couple more back in the room. We drank Mehkong with tea at Tom and Jerry's and watched football in The Rising Sun and Samui Arms. At midnight we finished the session with another bottle of Mehkong back in the room.

                Roz had her worst hangover of the trip so far and it rained all day. Didn't do a lot.

                The sun finally came out. It was still cloudy for a lot of the time but it was still warm enough to lie by the pool for most of the day (and to get burnt!)

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate at Landhaus and had a few wheat beers but Roz is still not back to 100% health following the hangover from yesterday.

                A similar day to yesterday after a rainy start. Most of the day by the pool. Pizza Hat for tea.

                We were due to move to one of the two beach-front bungalows for the final three days of our holiday. However we were told we could stay in 128 if we wanted to and, after looking at the one on the beach, we decided not to move.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather was back to normal for this time of year and Roz's health is also back to normal and she is eating meals again.

                We decided to have our final big session of the trip a few days early due to some of the hangovers we have had recently. We had a couple of beers on the balcony and a few more with food at Landhaus. We went to a couple of cocktail bars, had another wheat beer at The Thai Cat and started on the Mehkong at The Rising Sun. Ended the session with another bottle of whiskey back at the bungalow.

                Not too badly hungover but still did not make it to the pool until after 3. We had a couple of beers before tea and stopped at Landhaus for a couple more on the way home. Ended up having eight or nine in Landhaus and don't really know what time we got back. We finished off the leftovers from the previous night on our balcony.

                Once again, not too badly hungover so managed to spend some time at the pool. We went out to Landhaus for a final time at 8ish and for our last main meal of the trip had Austrian food. We had a few beers with the meal and then headed off to watch Sunderland play Chelsea. We saw the first half in The Rising Sun but were kicked out at half time due to them showing the rugby. We watched the second half in Bauhaus and then had a final bottle of Mehkong on our balcony.

                We had our last few hours by the pool and checked out of our room at 1:30pm. We got the Weekender mini-bus out to the airport for the 15:20 flight to Phuket. We had a three hour wait at Phuket before getting the 19:03 to K.L. After the usual confusion at KLIA we got the 23:55 flight back to LHR. The flight was fairly uneventful apart from an aborted landing and we eventually got back into England by about 6:30.
