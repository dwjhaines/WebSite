                At 9, we shared a taxi with two Americans who were in the same hotel as us out to Hanoi airport. Our plane left just about on time at 11:30 and by 1pm we were back in a hotel in the centre of Vientiane.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to head South towards Pakse tomorrow but we started having doubts about this journey today. By the time we had got to Vientiane we were just about 50-50 about staying in Laos or heading straight back into Thailand. The 15 hour bus journey to Pakse did not particularly appeal and we were not convinced that the sights of Southern Laos  were worth the effort involved in getting to them. After a lot of thought,  we selected a route through Thailand that will include a couple of nights in Sukhothai, the weekend in Bangkok and will mean getting to Ko Tao next Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had made up our minds about what we were doing, it was 5 o'clock. We used the Internet and then went to watch the sunset again - it was not as good as six weeks ago!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Nazeems for our evening meal and were joined by the two Americans from this mornings taxi. They were both quite pissed and it was quite an entertaining evening. (Roz felt ill again and didn't eat much).

                After breakfast at the Scandinavian Bakery, we checked out of our hotel and got a tuk-tuk out to the Friendship Bridge. We exited Laos, crossed the bridge by shuttle bus and re-entered Thailand. We got another tuk-tuk into Nong Kai, stopped at a bank to change money and then got the 11:20 bus to Khon Kaen. There was no real reason for going to Khon Kaen apart from the fact that it was a suitable stopping point on our way to Sukhothai. We arrived in Khon Kaen at about 2:45 and checked into a hotel fairly close to the bus station.

                Didn't do a lot for the rest of the day.

                We checked out of the hotel at 7 and walked back to the bus station. We got the 8 o'clock bus for Sukhothai and had an uneventful seven hour journey. WE checked into a hotel in "New Sukhothai" and had another afternoon with not a lot to do.

                We were up before 6 to make a start at the Sukhothai ruins. We got the "bus" out to the old city and hired bikes to get us around the sites. We entered the park at about 7:30.

                We spent about three and a half hours cycling round the temples and were both more impressed than we'd expected to be. We went round just about all of the Lonely Planet highlights and stopped at a few others along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had finished our sight-seeing by 11 and got straight on a bus back to our hotel. The timing was all ideal as we only wanted to spend one night in Sukhothai and we were back in time to check-out by midday. It was a one hour bus ride to Phitsanulok and, after checking into a hotel and visiting KFC for lunch, we continued our sight-seeing. The Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat was very impressive but the Buddha-casting foundry was less impressive.

                After a breakfast of chicken curry and roti, we got on the 9:15 bus to Bangkok. The journey took exactly five hours and was one of the most comfortable bus journeys of the trip so far. We got a taxi straight from the bus station to The Asia Hotel where we discovered that they did not have our reservation. I had to go and get a print out of our e-mail confirmation before they would let us check in. By the time this was all sorted out, it was about 3:30. We had an hour or so by the pool before heading off to McDonalds for a very late lunch.

                We had our first session for two and a half weeks starting with a couple of beers in the room. We had a bottle of Mehkong with our evening meal and another in in a bar on the way back to the hotel. We were back in the room to listen to the football results but  only vaguely remember things by this stage.

                We both had hangovers due to last night's session. In the morning I got a boat out to the train station and booked tickets through to Samui for tomorrow night. I walked from there to the post office to collect mail and then got another boat to Banglampu. On Khao San Road, I bought flags for Colin and then got the bus back to Siam Square area where I met Roz in McDonalds. After an hour using the Internet we slept for most of the remainder of the afternoon.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we returned to the same place that we ate at last night and where we had also eaten on our last two holidays in Thailand!

                We got up at 7 to go on a final sight-seeing tour around some of the places in Bangkok that we had not seen previously. We started off at Wat Saket/Golden Mount which was quite good - very good views of Bangkok. After that, we went to a couple of other temples stopping at Khao San Road for breakfast and finally the City Pillar.
