                We arrived in Nong Khain at 7:30 and got a "jumbo" out to the Thai side of The Friendship Bridge. We crossed the bridge by bus after leaving Thailand and then paid US$30 each for our Laos visas. We cleared immigration and entered our first new country of the trip so far.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once over the border, we got in a taxi that took us 20km to Vientiane, the capital. We were taken to a guest house that Lillian had recommended to us that was good at getting Vietnamese visas. We were put into a room while we waited for ours to become available and were able to have our first showers since leaving Weekender.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for breakfast and a quick walk around the city centre and then returned to the hotel to wait for our room.

                After we had changed rooms, we went out to start our sight-seeing, stopping for lunch on the way. We did the first half of the Lonely Planet walking tour and visited a couple of temples - Haw Pha Kaew and Wat Si Saket. We started the walk to Patuscai but it did not look too spectacular from a distance so we gave up before we got there.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went down to the Maekong River to watch the sunset. The sun going down was not too spectacular but the colour of the sky and the reflection off the water about half an hour later were superb. We had a few beers in riverside bars and were on our way to eat when we met an Irish bloke going in the opposite direction. We had a couple of beers with him and we were quite pissed by the time we eventually got to eat. Roz does not remember walking back to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 10th January</span>
                Didn't do a lot all morning due to the effects of last night's beer. In the afternoon we got a tuk-tuk out to another temple - Pha That Luang. This was pretty good and we spent about 45 minutes or so looking around before walking back into town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to watch the sun setting over the Maekong again and went for an excellent Indian meal for tea.
