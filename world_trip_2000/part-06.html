                We arrived in Nong Khain at 7:30 and got a "jumbo" out to the Thai side of The Friendship Bridge. We crossed the bridge by bus after leaving Thailand and then paid US$30 each for our Laos visas. We cleared immigration and entered our first new country of the trip so far.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once over the border, we got in a taxi that took us 20km to Vientiane, the capital. We were taken to a guest house that Lillian had recommended to us that was good at getting Vietnamese visas. We were put into a room while we waited for ours to become available and were able to have our first showers since leaving Weekender.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for breakfast and a quick walk around the city centre and then returned to the hotel to wait for our room.

                After we had changed rooms, we went out to start our sight-seeing, stopping for lunch on the way. We did the first half of the Lonely Planet walking tour and visited a couple of temples - Haw Pha Kaew and Wat Si Saket. We started the walk to Patuxai but it did not look too spectacular from a distance so we gave up before we got there.

                In the evening, we went down to the Maekong River to watch the sunset. The sun going down was not too spectacular but the colour of the sky and the reflection off the water about half an hour later were superb. We had a few beers in riverside bars and were on our way to eat when we met an Irish bloke going in the opposite direction. We had a couple of beers with him and we were quite pissed by the time we eventually got to eat. Roz does not remember walking back to the hotel.

                Didn't do a lot all morning due to the effects of last night's beer. In the afternoon we got a tuk-tuk out to another temple - Pha That Luang. This was pretty good and we spent about 45 minutes or so looking around before walking back into town.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to watch the sun setting over the Maekong again and went for an excellent Indian meal for tea.

                We had planned to spend the day at the pool of another hotel but it was cloudy when we got up so we did not bother. I walked out to the "Morning Market" and spent about an hour looking around. After lunch, we walked around the remaining four wats on the walking tour. The rest of the day was mainly spent lying around in the room reading.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were supposed to have our passports returned to us at 4:30pm complete with Vietnamese visas but just after 4, we were told that we would not get them back until tomorrow. This was not good news as we had planned to leave Vientiane early tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We couldn't be bothered to go and watch the sun set again but returned to the same Indian restaurant as last night and then went to a bar for the cheapest beer of the trip  so far (50p/6000 Kip a litre).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday 12th January</span>
                The man who we had given our passports to three days ago turned up at the hotel at 8:30 and told us he may not be able to get our visas until Monday. Fortunately, he had our passports with hm so we took them back and told him not to bother. This all meant that we had wasted a day yesterday but it was better than having to wait in Vientiane until Monday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel straight away and headed for the bus station, stopping for breakfast en route.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                People at the bus station seemed remarkably helpful after some of the places we had been and we got seats on the 1o:30 bus to Vang Vieng. the journey took three and a half hours and was probably a quite mild introduction to Laos bus travel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once in Vang Vieng, we checked into a guest house, had lunch and spent a couple of hours walking around the town and surrounding area.

                We went out again to eat in the evening but had a fairly early night. We booked ourselves on a kayaking.cave visiting tour for tomorrow.

                We got to the starting point of the tour by 9:30 and were on our way by 10. We were taken by songthaew about 10km up-river along with about 16 other people who were on the same tour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We started the tour by walking through a "traditional" Laos tribal village. The village did not seem quite as traditional as some we had seen in Flores (running water, electricity and T.V. aerials) but was quite interesting anyway.

                We walked down to the river and were put into yellow inflatable kayaks. We spent the rest of the day paddling down-river stopping at various points of interest along the way. We stopped first at a bamboo suspension bridge for no real reason. We all got out of the kayaks on one side of the river, walked across the bridge and got back in the kayaks on the other side.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Next stop was a cave, the main reason for visiting Vang Vieng. The cave was not too spectacular compared to some we have been to but the walk was quite good. We had lunch when we got down and then went to an organic farm from where silk was being produced. The final stop was at another cave. Roz decided not to go in as she had hurt her leg slipping at the first one. This cave was on a par with some others we had been to without the wooden walkways and lights, etc. We got back to Vang Vieng by 5:30 in time for the sunset by which time we were worn out, wet and covered in mud. It had all been pretty enjoyable and looked better than the tubing trip which had been our other option.

                We had a few beers with our evening meal and then went to a bar for a couple more. At 10, together with a group of four, mainly English, back-packers, we managed to persuade a cafe owner to put on the English football. We stayed almost until the end and returned to the room for the final scores.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 14th January</span>
                We got up by 7:30 and walked out to the place where the Luang Prabang bus departed from. There was apparently only one bus a day, leaving at 9am and costing 40,000 Kip. This was purely a tourist bus and seemed overpriced. We joined up with people we had met yesterday and tried to charter a songthaew as we had been told that this would be a cheaper option. This option, however, was quite a lot more expensive but by the time we had found this out, the bus was full.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The other people in our group paid to sit on plastic chairs in the aisle but we decided to hitch, wait  on the highway for a through bus from Vientiane or, if needed, wait for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had just started walking to the highway when another bus appeared and told us that it was going to Luang Prabang. We did not really know what was going on but we got on it anyway. Our bus left Vang Vieng about five minutes after the other one and overtook it ten minutes later. Our bus was a lot quicker than the other and we completed the journey by 2:15. We also had loads of space as there were only about 15 people on our bus so we came out of the deal incredibly well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked into a guest house, had lunch and spent a couple of hours wandering around the town. We visited a couple of wats - Wat Xieng Thong and Wat Mai Suwannaphumaham - which is the main reason for visiting Luang Prabang.

                A day spent mainly sight-seeing. We were roughly following the Lonely Planet walking tour around the various wats. We climbed up the hill in the centre of town to That Chomsi, passing wats along the way. After lunch, we walked into the grounds of the Royal Palace museum which was pretty spectacular. Although not all the wats were spectacular, it was all quite enjoyable and reasonably interesting.

                We got up at 6:30 and headed straight down to the Mehkong to begin our two day boat journey to Huay Xai on the Thai border. We had to wait 20 minutes for the ticket office to open and bought tickets to Pakbeng, the halfway point of the journey. We were on the boat just after 8 but it did not depart until 10ish.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The boat was reasonably comfortable. It was full mainly of locals together with about 15 back-packers. We heard someone saying that the journey was going to take three days instead of two but no-one really knew what was going on.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The scenery along the way was not overly spectacular but the journey was quite enjoyable anyway. We had plenty of stops for locals to get on and off and by 5:30, there were only a couple of locals left. At this point, our captain told us that we would not get to Pakbeng tonight and we would have to spend the night in a small village. The village had one guest house and after a bit of a scramble for rooms, we ended up sharing a single bed in a room with two others (we were sharing the room not the single bed). We ate in the villages only restaurant but they had just about run out of food by the time we got served so our table ended up with eggs and two-minute noodles. With not a lot to do, we were all in bed by about 9.

                We were up at 6:30 and back on the boat for a 7:00 departure. We made Pakbeng just after 8:00 and had a half hour wait to stock up on provisions (baguettes and cheese again) for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey was similar to yesterday but without all the stops to let people off. We made Huay Xai by 4:30 much to everyone's relief. I think we had been fairly lucky again with our traveling. We had been trying to get on the faster speedboats but when we saw these, they looked a lot less comfortable than the boat we were on. Also a lot of the slow boats we saw looked smaller and far more crowded than ours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Huay Xai, we got a tuk-tuk to immigration, left Laos and got a ferry across to Chiang Khong in Thailand. We got stamped into Thailand and then got taken to a guest house with seven other backpackers who had been with us for the whole journey. We ate at the guest house and I stayed up to watch a video but we were both asleep by 10:30.
