           We left Kingsclere on the 2pm bus to Basingstoke. This was late so we missed the 2:35 train but got the next one to Clapham Junction just after 3:00. We had a few hours to kill at Clapham before heading to Heathrow and spent the time in the Wetherspoons and The Falcon which had finally sorted out its beer selection again. There was a bit of confusion about trains from Clapham. They were not running out of Waterloo due to a signalling problem and it looked at one point as if we would have to find an alternative route but the 18:28 eventually appeared about 10 minutes late and we were in Feltham just after 7. We still had plenty of time so had a couple more drinks in our second Wetherspoons of the day.

          We got the bus from Feltham into Heathrow where we had time for a couple more drinks before boarding the 10:15 flight to Athens. The Fullers bar was closed but we were directed to another one that had an excellent 6% IPA. We had a couple in there before heading to the gate. We  boarded on time but the departure was delayed by about an our due to weather conditions over Europe. I slept through most of the delay!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th September</span>
           It was round about 4am local time when we landed in Athens. By the time we had gone through immigration and made our way to the domestic part of the terminal, we had just over an hour to wait for our onward flight to Leros. We departed Athens at about 6:30 and were in Leros an hour later. We walked through the small airport and got straight in a taxi to Leros Eleonas Apartments at Alinda Beach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           Although we arrived at Alinda just before 8am, we were able to check into our apartment straight away. This is our first time at Alinda and we had picked the apartment as it had such good reviews on Booking.com. The apartments do not have sea views but are just over the road from the beach and are very nice. Ours is easily big enough for four people and has a kitchen, a balcony at the front and another balcony/terrace type thing at the back. It also had bread, meat, cheese, jam and orange juice provided by the owners so we were able to have breakfast on the balcony as soon as we arrived.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After eating, we went for a walk along the beach front. When we got back, Roz went to the beach while I tried to catch up on sleep. We went for another walk to buy things from the supermarket, about a mile away and ate lunch on the balcony again. We did not really do a lot for the rest of the afternoon but made it to the beach (me as well this time) at about 4. We stayed for just over an hour before returning to the apartment for showers and to start the evening's drinking.

          We had a few drinks on the balcony before walking to To Steki, the nearest of the three restaurants that had been recommended to us. We had excellent meals sat at a table on the beach and got through another litre and a half of wine/retsina while getting confirmation of the death of the Queen. We were given complimentary ouzos when we paid our bill and don't remember too much after that.

          <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th September</span>
          Despite the amount we have had to drink the last couple of days, we woke up feeling quite healthy and fully recovered from the travelling on Wednesday night. We were given freshly baked bread by our Swedish neighbours and a plate of figs from the owners and once again had breakfast on the balcony. We both made it to the beach by about 11 and stayed there until 12:30. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had another walk to the supermarket before lunch and then had an hour or so lazing around the apartment. Just after 3, I went for a walk of about five miles to Agia Marina and back while Roz completed her mile of swimming for the day.

          After a few drinks on the balcony we headed towards the Alinda Hotel, the furthest away of the three recommended restaurants. However, we got as far as Prima Plora (the other one of the recommended restaurants) and decided to eat there instead. This place had nice tables by the waters edge again and good views of the almost full moon above the castle. Very good meals again although slightly more expensive than To Steki. We had another litre and a half of wine/retsina with the meal and a couple more drinks on the balcony when we got back.

        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th September</span>
          Got up at 10ish to find a plate of mini pastries left on our balcony. We ate these for breakfast before going down to the beach for an hour or so. We then both walked to Agia Marina stopping to buy things for lunch on the way back. We had an hour or so back at the apartment before going back to the beach again. Roz went off for her swim and I went for another short walk but it was an otherwise lazy afternoon.

          As usual, we had a few drinks on the balcony before going out. We started at 7 and joined the J-Team chat for an hour at 8. The owner of the apartments bought us a bottle of home-made raki which we had to taste so were already quite pissed when we went out to eat at 9. We ate at To Steki again. We had an excellent table by the sea again and another very good meal.

        <p class="diary-text">
           <span class="diary-date">Sunday 11th September</span>
          A similar day to yesterday. Nothing from the owner this morning but a plate of oat biscuits from our neighbours. We had toast and jam on the balcony for breakfast before our first trip of the day to the beach just after 11:00. We went for a short walk at 1ish and I carried on to the supermarket to buy stuff for lunch and for this evening. Had another afternoon on the beach and were both back in the apartment and ready to start drinking again by 7.

          We spent an hour and a half on the balcony watching the cricket and headed off to eat when bad light stopped play. We ate at To Staki for the third time in our four nights here. Excellent meals again at the same table as last night. Another enjoyable evening.

        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Monday 12th September</span>
          We were up slightly earlier than usual, had breakfast on the balcony (more complimentary cheese and spinach pastries) and then headed to the beach for an hour. We had to check out of the apartment at midday. We have really enjoyed our stay here and would probably have booked for longer if we had known how good it was going to be. We will try and get back here next year and could easily stay a lot longer. We found Dimitri and paid the balance of €200 that we still owed him and got him to order us a taxi.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          The taxi turned up about 10 minutes later and took us back to Tony's beach resort at Vromolithos Beach, the place we stayed at when we visited Leros for the first time four years ago. We were shown straight to our room and have a balcony overlooking the sea again. Not quite as good a view as the one we had last time but still very good. After unpacking, we had lunch on the balcony and made it down to the beach area by about 3.

          Just after 5, we walked into Lakki, the main town on the island. There did not seem to be too much of interest here but we found out where we could buy ferry tickets from and picked up a few things from the supermarket on the way back.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a week of consuming too much alcohol every day, we decided that we needed a couple of days off. We went out to eat just after 8 but did not have drinks on the balcony first and only had water with our meals. We ate at Dimitris o Karaflas, the restaurant at the top of the hill that we had eaten in a couple of times the last time we were here. We were pleased to see Bekri Meze on the menu - a beef and pork stew that we had a few times at Alinda. Excellent food again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked down to Pantelli Beach after we had eaten and then went back for an early and sober night.

        <p class="diary-text">
          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 13th September</span>
          We were up earlier again this morning and left the hotel before 8 to walk up to Leros Castle. We walked first to Pantelli where we had hoped to buy breakfast. There was not too much open there and what was open did not really sell what we wanted so we had a slight change of plan and walked to Mike's Bakery in Platanos. We bought cheese pies and ate them on the steps of the library before starting the walk up to the castle.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had planned to walk up via the road and back down via the steep steps that lead into Platanos. As we were already in the town, we went up the steep route. This did not work out too badly as it was not too hot yet and a lot of the way was in the shade anyway. It probably took less than 30 minutes to get to the top. We had been up here four years ago and once again, the views were superb. We had enjoyed it last time but this time we could recognise a lot more of the places around the island. We had perfect views of Vromolithos, Alinda, Agia Marina and Lakki as well as plenty of other islands in the area.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Last time we were here you had to pay to go into the castle itself but this time it was free so we went in again and spent 15 minutes or so walking round the walls taking more photos. We walked back down via the road and past the six windmills. Previously you could only see them from the road but today we were able to walk round them. It was an easy walk back down and we were back at Tony's by 10:20.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a couple of hours by the beach although it was quite windy today and not that pleasant being outside by the sea. We had lunch on the balcony and then I went back to Lakki to buy our ferry tickets for next Sunday.... only to find that the office is closed from 15:00 to 17:50. I walked back to the apartment via the supermarket again.

          Although we had planned on a couple of days off alcohol, we decided to have a few drinks tonight. We started with wine and retsina on the balcony and then returned to Dimitris o Karaflas where we had a table booked with a sea view this time. Very good meals again although I was not as impressed with the squid as with some of the meals we have had there. We had three bottles of retsina with the meal (it is cheaper than the white wine) and returned to the balcony for a few more drinks while watching the first half of Swansea v Sheff Utd before going to bed.

          Roz went to the beach as soon as we got up this morning and I went straight out for my walk. I walked up to the castle via Pantelli Beach and the road. I did not go into it this time but came straight back down the steps to Platanos instead. From there, I extended the walk by walking down the hill to the ferry port at Agia Marina. This was closer than I thought and is only just over a mile from where we are staying. I walked back to Tony's stopping to buy cheese/spinach pies and bread on the way.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a late breakfast on the balcony (the same balcony despite Roz's attempt to move to a room with a better view). Did not do a lot for the rest of the day except for reading at the beach or lazing around in the room.

           We had a very similar evening to yesterday. Drinks on the balcony, ate at Dimitris o Karaflas (excellent stifado!) and then managed to watch the whole of the Reading v Sunderland game with more wine/retsina.

        <p class="diary-text">

           Another day of not doing a lot. We had yesterday's bread with jam for breakfast on the balcony. Spent most of the rest of the day either at the beach or in the room. I walked to Lakki and back after lunch with another stop at the supermarket on the way back.

           <span class="diary-date">Friday 16th September</span>
           We were awake in time to see the sunrise this morning. Our balcony faces East so although the views are not as good as in our last room here, we do get perfect views of the sun rising. After we had taken our photos, we headed straight out to walk up to the castle again. We bought pies from Mike's Bakery for breakfast which we ate on the steps of the library in Platanos again before walking up the steps.  We were earlier than three days ago so the castle was closed when we got up there but the views are just as spectacular from the area just below. We walked back past the windmills and were back in the room before 10.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           Spent most of the rest of the day at the beach. Just before 5, we walked into Lakki again. When I had been there a couple of days ago, I had seen a bar (Persiana Beer & Grill) which looked as if it sold a range of Belgium beers. It was closed when we got there but as we were both peering through the window, a bar-maid turned up and opened up for us. We had a couple of wheat beers (our first beers since getting to Greece) before going to the office to buy our ferry tickets for Sunday and then walking back to Tony's.

          Despite the amount we had drunk last night, we were awake by 6:30 to watch the sunrise again. Once again, a very nice way to start the day. After returning to bed for an hour or so, I got up again at 8:30 and went out for a final walk up to the castle for this trip. I walked up via the road and went into the castle again for another look around. I walked back down via the steps stopping at Mike's to buy pies for breakfast.

          After eating on the balcony we went down to the beach for a couple of hours. Today I joined Roz on her swim to Pantelli and back, a distance of about 2km in total. Great views of the castle and windmills from the bay at Pantelli but the beach did not look too appealing with the number of people on it. After drying off, it was back to the room for lunch and then the start of the afternoon's football
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Swansea's game v Hull was the early kick-off on Sky so we knew we knew we would be able to watch that on Hesgoal.com and when that had finished, we were also able to watch Watford v Sunderland. Two good games and two good results.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As soon as the second game had finished, it was time to start drinking again. Tonight was our last night on Leros and it was not too different to most of the previous ones here. We had wine and retsina with crisps and cheese on the balcony before making our way up the hill to the restaurant. Excellent meals as usual and for the second night running we were given our third bottle of retsina on the house.

          We were up by 9, packed up our stuff and checked out of Tony's by about 9:45. We did not bother with a taxi this time but walked the 1.1 miles to Agia Marina, stopping at a cafe/bakery for breakfast on the way. We were at the port by 10:35 and had a wait of 50 minutes for the 11:25 catamaran. The boat arrived on time and by 12:10 we were on Kalymnos.

          We had a walk of about 20 minutes to get to Villa Melina where we were booked to stay for the next two nights. We had to wait about 45 minutes before our room was ready and we were then given a room without a balcony despite the fact that Roz had requested one. The room in the main villa was not particularly nice and I was not that keen on staying in it regardless of whether or not it had a balcony. Roz went down to sort it out (she had confirmation that we had been told we would have a balcony) and we were moved to a much nicer room with a large terrace shared by us and one or two other rooms.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After unpacking we went for a walk around the harbour area. We went to buy our tickets to Kos but the office was closed. We walked to the nearest beach which is not far from the port but it was nothing too spectacular and not one we will bother returning to! We walked back to the hotel stopping for take-away gyros for lunch on the way. I spent the rest of the afternoon in the room while Roz went to the pool.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As usual we started the evening with a few drinks on the terrace. While we were sat there, Roz noticed that the diamond was missing from her engagement ring. We spent a bit of time looking for it although it was always unlikely that we were ever going to find it. We had to eventually give up and carry on drinking instead.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we were walking round this afternoon, we had spotted a bar at the edge of the harbour that we liked the look of and decided to go there for a drink before eating. Once there, the old man that was serving us spoke no English. I managed to establish that we both wanted white wine which he was able to cope with but despite the fact that I had told him we did not want to eat anything, he kept bringing us small plates of meze type food. We just accepted everything and spent the rest of the evening there. Once we had started, there did not seem any need to go to a restaurant to eat. Not quite the evening that we had planned but an enjoyable one nevertheless. We had no idea what everything cost but the whole evening cost us €25 for almost two litres of wine and all the food. We returned to the terrace to finish the bottle of wine that we had started earlier.

          We had breakfast included with our room here. There is no restaurant as such but we went down to the breakfast room, collected our food and returned to eat it on our terrace.

          At 11:00 we went out for a walk. We had planned to go up to the castle but the monastery that is on the hill above the harbour looked more spectacular so we climbed up there instead. Climbing up at the hottest part of the day was probably not the best of ideas but it was not that hard a climb and we were up there in just under an hour. The views from the top were excellent although we could not go into the monastery itself as we were not "appropriately dressed".
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked down from the top to the harbour where the ferry ticket office was once again closed. We walked back to the hotel collecting pies for lunch and wine for tonight on the way. We were back just after 1, had lunch on the terrace and spent the afternoon on the pool or terrace while watching bits of the Queen's funeral.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We went out to eat after drinks on the balcony. We had decided against the seafood restaurants and walked instead to a cheaper place we had seen by the port. The food here was not as good as it was where we were eating on Leros but it was cheap and a nice enough place to sit with a couple of bottles of retsina. When it came to paying, their card machine was  not working and we did not have enough cash so we were told by the slightly mad owner to come back and pay tomorrow. We walked back to the hotel and finished the wine on our terrace again.

          <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 20th September</span>
          We had breakfast sat by the pool this morning. After eating, I went back to the port, bought tickets for the 12:00 ferry to Mastichari on Kos and then went to pay our bill from last night. We had an hour or so sat on the terrace back at the hotel and checked out at 11. We walked to the port and waited for the ferry which came in at 11:30. This was a much smaller boat than the one we had arrived on but we got seats on the deck upstairs and it was a pleasant enough 30 minute journey.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived at Mastichari at about 12:30 and walked to Cirillo Family Hotel where we had booked a room for the night. We were shown to our room straight away. A bit more modern than the last place we stayed at! After unpacking we headed off towards the beach. The owners of the hotel were very keen to get us to use their sun-beds on the beach that is about 400m away. Mr Cirillo escorted us to their area of the beach but found that there was a €6 charge to use the sun-beds. I was not planning on staying on the beach anyway and Roz went further along to a sandy area that she could stay on without paying.

        <p class="diary-text">
          I went off to get lunch from a bakery which we ate back on the beach. I then left Roz there and walked to see the Traditional Windmill Of Antimachia just over three miles away. I went more because I wanted to go for a walk than because I wanted to see the windmill but it was worth seeing and the only traditional working windmill in Greece. I was back at the hotel just after 4 and Roz arrived back from the beach about 30 minutes later.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Tonight was our last night in Greece and we had a fairly similar evening to most of the other ones. We started with the cheapest white wine of the trip so far on the balcony. We walked into the main part of Mastichari and looked at a couple of restaurants before settling on one that we liked the look of (Restaurant Harama). We had excellent food in here, back to the standards of the food we were eating on Leros. We had a litre and a half of wine with the meal, bought a few souvenirs and returned to the hotel. The bar area was livelier than we were expecting it to be so we had another bottle of retsina there before returning to the balcony to finish our wine. A good night.

          <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 21st September</span>
          I was up at 7:15 and walked to the bakery to buy breakfast which we ate on the balcony. We packed our bags and checked out of the hotel by 8:15. We had ordered a taxi for 8:30. It turned up by 8:20 and we were at the airport 10 minutes later. We already had our boarding passes, there was no passport checks and security was very quick so by 8:40 we were sat at the gate waiting for the 10:10 Ryan Air flight to Bergamo. We did not have that long to wait as they started moving us around at 9:10 and the plane departed on time
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived in Bergamo on time at 12:05 local time. Here again, everything went very smoothly and we were on a bus heading to the train station by 12:27. At the station, we managed to buy tickets for the 13:20 train to Milan. We tried without success to buy something to eat. The supermarkets were either closed or not where they were marked on the map. We eventually had to give up and get on the train which left on time. We got off the train at Monza and had a 20 minute wait for our connection to Como. This gave us enough time to buy food for lunch and have a quick look at The Orient Express as it came through the station.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Our connection was also on time and we arrived at Como San Giovanni at 15:14. As soon as we came out of the station we saw Shiela who had got here earlier today. We walked with her to the apartment we had booked and met Aleks and Andi outside. Marco turned up a few minutes later and let us in, showed us how the lift worked, gave us the keys, etc. The apartment is a bit dated but is in an excellent location near the lake and Como Lago train station and has more than enough room for six people.

          After we had allocated bedrooms, I went out for a quick look around the town, bought a few bottles of wine and met Steve who arrived at Como Lago on the 16:44 train from Milan. After showers, we started on the wine before heading out to eat. We looked at a few places at the side of the lake before settling on Ristorante e Pizzeria Fontana D'Oro. We had excellent pizzas in there with a few litres of the house wine. After eating we walked back to Cornobobò, a craft beer bar less than a minutes walk from the apartment. The draft beer in there was excellent. One of Steve's mates, Neil met us in there and we stayed there until it closed at midnight.

          <span class="diary-date">Thursday 22nd September</span>
          We were all up by 9ish and headed out for breakfast by about 10. Aleks, Andi, Steve and Shiela were all keen on going on a boat trip along the lake. I was not so keen. I had no desire to spend four hours sitting on the slow boat and also not that keen on spending €30 on the fast boat. Roz was not bothered either so we decided to give it a miss. We waited while the others queued for tickets for the 12:10 boat and then all went for breakfast in one of the squares. Roz and I left them all in the restaurant and went off to the supermarket for more wine which we took back to the apartment.

          At 12:15 we headed out for a walk. We went a mile or so along the lake in one direction before wandering round the old town. We then went out in the other direction to see some of the larger buildings and monuments on that side. We ended the walk with excellent ice-creams before returning to the apartment.

          The others got back to Como at about 3 and we went out to meet them at a restaurant and waited while they had lunch. The restaurant was at the base of the funicular railway that goes up to Brunate. After everyone had eaten, we joined queue to go up. The queues were not too long but it still took us 45 minutes to get on the train. It was a spectacular five minute journey up the steep hill. There was not a lot to see in Brunate apart from the views looking down to the lake. Five of us (excluding Sheila) decided to walk to the Faro Voltiano, a lighthouse that is just about the tallest point on the hill. It was quite a tough 30 minute climb but the views made it worthwhile. We had decided not to climb the lighthouse as it was €2 each to go in but it was about to close and the ticket seller said we could go in for free if we were quick. More excellent views from the very top.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Aleks and Andi made it up the hill as we were about to start going down. Steve, Roz and myself left them there to recover from the walk and went back down to the funicular station. Thankfully there was no queue this time. We met up with Shiela and got the first train back down. We walked straight back to the apartment. Roz and I had showers before starting on the wine. Steve and Sheila left the apartment at 7:45. There has been a lot of confusion over their hotel booking in Milan and they wanted to get there tonight to ensure they have somewhere to stay for tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We waited for Aleks and Andi to return, had a few more glasses of wine and then went out to eat. We ate at L'Orologio, a pizza restaurant next door but one to Cornobobò. We had very good meals again and then went back into Cornobobò where we found Neil again. We had a couple of beers in there before returning to the apartment to finish the wine.

          Aleks and Andi got the 10:15 train from Como Lago to Milan as they are flying home today. We walked with them to the station, bought our tickets for the later train and then walked to Carrefour to buy stuff for breakfast. Marco came round to the apartment just before 11 for "check-out" and we walked to the station to get on the 11:15 train. We had to change trains after 10 minutes at Como Camerlata. The train from there was packed. Roz got a seat but I was standing all the way to Milan.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived in Milan a few minutes late at about 12:20 and went straight to the FA ticket collection point, a hotel just outside the central station. This was the first time in a while that we had picked up tickets on match day and the queues were longer than we have seen before. It took us about 45 minutes from joining the queue to collecting our tickets.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Once we had our tickets, We walked back to the central station metro and got a train out to Lotto, the nearest metro station to our hotel. From there it was a 20 minute walk to the hotel - Hotel Astoria, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western. We had chosen this as it was cheaper than the central Milan hotels and only about a mile from the San Siro. After showers, we decided we could not be bothered to go back into the centre to meet Steve but would instead drink locally and work our way towards the ground.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We had a vague plan of heading to a craft beer bar that opened at 6pm. We stopped in a couple of places for a few glasses of wine and then thought we needed to get something to eat. As usual in Italy, this proved not as easy as it should have been as most restaurants close during the afternoon. We had a few changes of plan but eventually headed for a restaurant that opened at 5:30 with another good looking beer place (Pazzeria) just over the road. The restaurant was shut and did not look like opening so we had pizzas from a fast food type Turkish kebab shop. We were not overly optimistic about the quality of these but they turned out to be pretty good. We ate them sat outside with another beer each. By the time we had eaten, Pazzaria was open and we went in for a couple of beers before starting our walk to the ground just after 7.

          The bar was a couple of km from the ground. We had a couple more stops for wine on the way and got to the ground just after 8. Getting into the ground was reasonably smooth. There is always potential for problems getting to the ground that close to kick-off time in some places but this was all reasonably well organised and we got in without any issues. We found Steve and Mick as we went in and climbed up one of the towers to the top tier. We found a section that was not too crowded and were in our seats about 15 minutes before kick-off.

          The ground itself was very spectacular and visiting it was one of the reasons we were keen to go to the game. It was a shame that there were not more people there as the atmosphere would have been better but the views from where we were sat were excellent. As with a lot of our previous England trips, the only bad part of the day was the football itself which was dire. Another game without scoring and our relegation from Group A of the Nations League was confirmed.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were held in the ground for about 30 minutes after the game and then herded towards the metro station which was in the opposite direction to our hotel but once we were away from the crowds there, it was about a 30 minute walk back to the hotel. We had thought about going for another drink but it was easier just to go straight back. We were back in the hotel just before midnight.

          We had planned to spend the morning seeing a few of the sights of Milan but it was grey and wet when we got up so sight-seeing was not particularly appealing. We checked out of the hotel at 10:30 and went to McDonalds for breakfast before getting back on the Metro at Lotto. We got a train directly to the cathedral, the main sight and the only one that we were that bothered about seeing. All very spectacular but it was still cold and wet and there were too many people around.

        <p class="diary-text">
          After taking a few photos, we started walking towards the station. It was not the weather for wandering around too much and anywhere that was undercover was packed with people sheltering from the rain. Just after the cathedral, we did find the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping centre. Roz had seen pictures of this and had been quite keen to visit it. We were able to walk through it just about on the way to the station. When we came out of there we had a walk of about 30 minutes to get back to the station. We bought tickets for the 13:05 train to Bergamo and waited around in the station until we could board the train which left on time.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We arrived in Bergamo at 13:53. We walked from the station to the apartment we have booked for the next two days (Fashion House Elvira 1), about 15 minutes away. We found the entrance to the apartment and were met straight away by the owner who let us in. She then spent about half an hour giving us a tour of the apartment and a lot of advice about walks, restaurants, etc. In fairness, most of what she told us was quite interesting and useful. The apartment itself was very modern and clean and had a small balcony overlooking a nice little square. Ideal for a couple of nights. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After she had left, we went straight out to the Carrefour Express over the road to buy food for lunch and wine for tonight. We ate in the apartment and after unpacking, went out to walk to the old town or Città Alta as it is known locally. We set off just after 3:30. We planned a longer walk around the area for tomorrow but for today, I was just interested in the four craft beer bars that were located there. It was still raining when we went out. Not too heavily but enough to make it not ideal for sight-seeing.

          We walked up the hill to the walls of the old town and headed straight for Birreria di Città Alta. This was a lovely little place with a good range of mainly foreign (i.e. not Italian) beers. After one in there we did have a look round the centre on our way to the next bar - Caffè del Tasso 1476. This was more of a cafe than a bar (there was a hint in the name!) and did not have a very good range of beers so we left without having a drink. We walked back down the hill to the third bar on my list - Fly. This was an excellent place with six beers from an Italian brewery. We were only going to have one in here but had good seats so we stayed for a couple and decided to miss the fourth bar. I had two very good IPAs, one of which was 7%. Both were €5 for 500ml which was also pretty  good value for such a touristy area.

          We walked back down to the apartment, had showers and a few glasses of wine before going out. We had been recommended a couple of restaurants and looked at a few others but they all either did not look particularly appealing, were fully booked or did not have cheap house wine. We eventually found one that we really did like the look of, Taverna del Gallo da Salvatore, and although they were full, they told us we could have a table at 10. We reserved the table and went to Pivo Beer Bar, another very good craft beer bar with a good range of local beers. We spent about an hour and a half in there and then went back to the restaurant. We had very good pizzas and a litre of wine between us before returning to the apartment to finish the evening off with a couple of drinks on the balcony.

          We were up by about 9:30 and pleased to see that the weather was a lot better than yesterday. It was still not that warm and was cloudy but the rain had stopped and much more suitable for sight-seeing than yesterday. We had breakfast in the apartment before heading out to have another look round the old town.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked up to Città Alta the same way as we had gone yesterday as far as Porta San Giacomo. From there, instead of going into the old town, we walked round the walls as far as Porta Sant'Alessandro. We could have kept walking up the hill from here but there was no queue for the funicular (Funicolare S. Vigilio) and it was about to depart so we got on that for the trip up to Bergamo's highest point. There were excellent views from here, particularly looking back at the old town.

We need to be at the airport before 5am so wanted to check the timetable.

          Despite the early start tomorrow we decided to have a few drinks tonight as it was our last night in Italy. We bought another 1 litre carton of white wine from Carrefour (€1.39) and it was just about warm enough to have a few glasses on the balcony before going out to eat. Last night when we left the restaurant we had booked another table for 7:30 this evening. We had another very good meal (pizzas for the fifth night running) before returning to the apartment to finish the wine. We got to bed just after 9.

          I was awake by about 3:00 and we were both up at 3:50. We packed the rest of our things, left the apartment and walked to the bus stop at Porta Nuova. The 4:30 bus appeared on time and we were at the airport by 4:45, 70 minutes before our flight was due to depart.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As soon as we got into the airport, we could see a huge queue to get through security. We joined the back and although it was moving quite quickly, missing our flight was looking a possibility, not helped by the number of people pushing in. As we got towards the front of the queue we got let through a gate to go straight through. Passport control was very quick and we got to the gate two minutes before it was due to close. We boarded the plane which departed on time at 5:55.

        <p class="diary-text">
          We landed in Stansted just before 7 UK time. We got through immigration fairly quickly and bought tickets for a National Express bus to central London. We did not have long to wait and by 7:35 were on our way. The journey to Baker Street took two hours due to traffic on the M11 and North Circular. There are times when this would have been quite frustrating but the bus was only about a third full so we had two seats each and were quite comfortable. The weather which was cold and wet at Stansted was improving by the time we got to London so the whole thing did not work out too badly.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We were dropped next to Baker Street station and went straight into The Metropolitan Bar for a Wetherspoons breakfast. After eating, we walked the two miles to the Farringdon Travelodge. We arrived at 11 and by paying an extra £10 were able to check into the room straight away. We would not normally bother doing this but today it was very good value as we did not want to have to return to the hotel to check in at 3pm. We had much needed showers spent an hour or so in the room and headed out at 12:30.

          We had arranged to meet Steve in The Doric Arch at 4 but as we had checked in earlier than expected, we let him know that we could get there earlier. We walked to Ye Olde Mitre for our first drink of the day and from there to Harrison's Bar, a cask marque pub that had been closed the previous time we had tried to visit. While in here we had a message from Steve saying he would be at the Doric Arch by 3. We walked to Euston and had one in the Euston Tap before going to meet him. We had an enjoyable few hours in The Doric Arch where we were joined by Paul and Neil before heading to the ground at about 6:45, an hour before kick-off.

          We got the underground from Euston Square and were in the ground just before kick-off. The game did not start well but the last half hour was entertaining enough and at least they did not get beaten again. We were straight out of the ground after the game and despite the crowds, we managed to walk all the way into Wembley Park station and straight onto a fast train back to Farringdon. Back in the hotel by 10:40.

          We checked out of the hotel at about 9:30 and walked to Waterloo stopping at McDonalds at St Paul's for breakfast on the way. We caught the 11:05 train back to Basingstoke. We just missed the 11:40 bus from Basingstoke and could not be bothered to wait 50 minutes for the next one so got a taxi home. Arrived in Kingsclere just after midday.
