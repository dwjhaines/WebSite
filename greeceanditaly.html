            We left Kingsclere on the 2pm bus to Basingstoke. This was late so we missed the 2:35 train but got the next one to Clapham Junction just after 3:00. We had a few hours to kill at Clapham before heading to Heathrow and spent the time in the Wetherspoons and The Falcon which had finally sorted out its beer selection again. There was a bit of confusion about trains from Clapham. They were not running out of Waterloo due to a signalling problem and it looked at one point as if we would have to find an alternative route but the 18:28 eventually appeared about 10 minutes late and we were in Feltham just after 7. We still had plenty of time so had a couple more drinks in our second Wetherspoons of the day.

			We got the bus from Feltham into Heathrow where we had time for a couple more drinks before boarding the 10:15 flight to Athens. The Fullers bar was closed but we were directed to another one that had an excellent 6% IPA so we had a couple in there before heading to the gate. We  boarded on time but the departure was delayed by about an our due to weather conditions over Europe. I slept through most of the delay!

            It was round about 4am local time when we landed in Athens. By the time we had gone through immigration and made our way to the domestic part of the terminal, we had just over an hour to wait for our onward flight to Leros. We departed Athens at about 6:30 and were in Leros an hour later. We walked through the small airport and got straight in a taxi to Leros Eleonas Apartments at Alinda Beach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           Although we arrived at Alinda just before 8am, we were able to check into our apartment straight away. This is our first time at Alinda and we had picked the apartment as it had such good reviews on Booking.com. The apartments do not have sea views but are just over the road from the beach and are very nice. Ours is easily big enough for four people and has a kitchen, a balcony at the front and another balcony/terrace type thing at the back. It also had bread, meat, cheese and orange juice provided by the owners so we were able to have breakfast on the balcony as soon as we arrived.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
		  After eating, we went for a walk along the beach front. When we got back, Roz went to the beach while I tried to catch up on sleep. We went for another walk to buy things from the supermarket, about a mile away and ate lunch on the balcony again. We did not really do a lot for the rest of the afternoon but made it to the beach (me as well this time) at about 4. We stayed for just over an hour before returning to the apartment for showers and to start the evening's drinking.

          We had a few drinks on the balcony before walking to To Steki, the nearest of the three restaurants that had been recommended to us. We had excellent meals sat at a table on the beach and got through another litre and a half of wine/retsina while getting confirmation of the death of the Queen. We were given complimentary ouzos when we paid our bill and don't remember too much after that.

           <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th September</span>
           Despite the amount we have had to drink the last couple of days, we woke up feeling quite healthy and fully recovered from the travelling on Wednesday night. We were given freshly baked bread by our Swedish neighbours and a plate of figs from the owners and once again had breakfast on the balcony. We both made it to the beach by about 11 and stayed there until 12:30. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           We had another walk to the supermarket before lunch and then had an hour or so lazing around the apartment. Just after 3, I went for a walk of about five miles to Agia Marina and back while Roz completed her mile of swimming for the day.

           After a few drinks on the balcony we headed towards the Alinda Hotel, the furthest away of the three recommended restaurants. However, we got as far as Prima Plora (the other one of the recommended restaurants) and decided to eat there instead. This place had nice tables by the waters edge again and good views of the almost full moon above the castle. Very good meals again although slightly more expensive than To Steki. We had another litre and a half of wine/retsina with the meal and a couple more drinks on the balcony when we got back.

           <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th September</span>
           Got up at 10ish to find a plate of mini pastries left on our balcony. We ate these for breakfast before going down to the beach for an hour or so. We then both walked to Agia Marina stopping to buy things for lunch on the way back.
