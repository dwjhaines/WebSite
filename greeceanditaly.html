            We left Kingsclere on the 2pm bus to Basingstoke. This was late so we missed the 2:35 train but got the next one to Clapham Junction just after 3:00. We had a few hours to kill at Clapham before heading to Heathrow and spent the time in the Wetherspoons and The Falcon which had finally sorted out its beer selection again. There was a bit of confusion about trains from Clapham. They were not running out of Waterloo due to a signalling problem and it looked at one point as if we would have to find an alternative route but the 18:28 eventually appeared about 10 minutes late and we were in Feltham just after 7. We still had plenty of time so had a couple more drinks in our second Wetherspoons of the day.

			We got the bus from Feltham into Heathrow where we had time for a couple more drinks before boarding the 10:15 flight to Athens. The Fullers bar was closed but we were directed to another one that had an excellent 6% IPA so we had a couple in there before heading to the gate. We  boarded on time but the departure was delayed by about an our due to weather conditions over Europe. I slept through most of the delay!

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 8th September</span>
            It was round about 4am local time when we landed in Athens. By the time we had gone through immigration and made our way to the domestic part of the terminal, we had just over an hour to wait for our onward flight to Leros. We departed Athens at about 6:30 and were in Leros an hour later. We walked through the small airport and got straight in a taxi to Leros Eleonas Apartments at Alinda Beach.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           Although we arrived at Alinda just before 8am, we were able to check into our apartment straight away. This is our first time at Alinda and we had picked the apartment as it had such good reviews on Booking.com. The apartments do not have sea views but are just over the road from the beach and are very nice. Ours is easily big enough for four people and has a kitchen, a balcony at the front and another balcony/terrace type thing at the back. It also had bread, meat, cheese, jam and orange juice provided by the owners so we were able to have breakfast on the balcony as soon as we arrived.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
		  After eating, we went for a walk along the beach front. When we got back, Roz went to the beach while I tried to catch up on sleep. We went for another walk to buy things from the supermarket, about a mile away and ate lunch on the balcony again. We did not really do a lot for the rest of the afternoon but made it to the beach (me as well this time) at about 4. We stayed for just over an hour before returning to the apartment for showers and to start the evening's drinking.

          We had a few drinks on the balcony before walking to To Steki, the nearest of the three restaurants that had been recommended to us. We had excellent meals sat at a table on the beach and got through another litre and a half of wine/retsina while getting confirmation of the death of the Queen. We were given complimentary ouzos when we paid our bill and don't remember too much after that.

           <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th September</span>
           Despite the amount we have had to drink the last couple of days, we woke up feeling quite healthy and fully recovered from the travelling on Wednesday night. We were given freshly baked bread by our Swedish neighbours and a plate of figs from the owners and once again had breakfast on the balcony. We both made it to the beach by about 11 and stayed there until 12:30. 
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           We had another walk to the supermarket before lunch and then had an hour or so lazing around the apartment. Just after 3, I went for a walk of about five miles to Agia Marina and back while Roz completed her mile of swimming for the day.

           After a few drinks on the balcony we headed towards the Alinda Hotel, the furthest away of the three recommended restaurants. However, we got as far as Prima Plora (the other one of the recommended restaurants) and decided to eat there instead. This place had nice tables by the waters edge again and good views of the almost full moon above the castle. Very good meals again although slightly more expensive than To Steki. We had another litre and a half of wine/retsina with the meal and a couple more drinks on the balcony when we got back.

           <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th September</span>
           Got up at 10ish to find a plate of mini pastries left on our balcony. We ate these for breakfast before going down to the beach for an hour or so. We then both walked to Agia Marina stopping to buy things for lunch on the way back. We had an hour or so back at the apartment before going back to the beach again. Roz went off for her swim and I went for another short walk but it was an otherwise lazy afternoon.

          As usual, we had a few drinks on the balcony before going out. We started at 7 and joined the J-Team chat for an hour at 8. The owner of the apartments bought us a bottle of home-made raki which we had to taste so were already quite pissed when we went out to eat at 9. We ate at To Steki again. We had an excellent table by the sea again and another very good meal.

        <p class="diary-text">
           <span class="diary-date">Sunday 11th September</span>
           A similar day to yesterday. Nothing from the owner this morning but a plate of oat biscuits from our neighbours. We had toast and jam on the balcony for breakfast before our first trip of the day to the beach just after 11:00. We went for a short walk at 1ish and I carried on to the supermarket to buy stuff for lunch and for this evening. Had another afternoon on the beach and were both back in the apartment and ready to start drinking again by 7.

           We spent an hour and a half on the balcony watching the cricket and headed off to eat when bad light stopped play. We ate at To Staki for the third time in our four nights here. Excellent meals again at the same table as last night. Another enjoyable evening.

        <p class="diary-text">
           <span class="diary-date">Monday 12th September</span>
           We were up slightly earlier than usual, had breakfast on the balcony (more complimentary cheese and spinach pastries) and then headed to the beach for an hour. We had to check out of the apartment at midday. We have really enjoyed our stay here and would probably have booked for longer if we had known how good it was going to be. We will try and get back here next year and could easily stay a lot longer. We found Dimitri and paid the balance of €200 that we still owed him and got him to order us a taxi.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           The taxi turned up about 10 minutes later and took us back to Tony's beach resort at Vromolithos Beach, the place we stayed at when we visited Leros for the first time four years ago. We were shown straight to our room and have a balcony overlooking the sea again. Not quite as good a view as the one we had last time but still very good. After unpacking, we had lunch on the balcony and made it down to the beach area by about 3.

          Just after 5, we walked into Lakki, the main town on the island. There did not seem to be too much of interest here but we found out where we could buy ferry tickets from and picked up a few things from the supermarket on the way back.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After a week of consuming too much alcohol every day, we decided that we needed a couple of days off. We went out to eat just after 8 but did not have drinks on the balcony first and only had water with our meals. We ate at Dimitris o Karaflas, the restaurant at the top of the hill that we had eaten in a couple of times the last time we were here. We were pleased to see Bekri Meze on the menu - a beef and pork stew that we had a few times at Alinda. Excellent food again.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          We walked down to Pantelli Beach after we had eaten and then went back for an early and sober night.

        <p class="diary-text">
           <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 13th September</span>
           We were up earlier again this morning and left the hotel before 8 to walk up to Leros Castle. We walked first to Pantelli where we had hoped to buy breakfast. There was not too much open there and what was open did not really sell what we wanted so we had a slight change of plan and walked to Mike's Bakery in Platanos. We bought cheese pies and ate them on the steps of the library before starting the walk up to the castle.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           We had planned to walk up via the road and back down via the steep steps that lead into Platanos. As we were already in the town, we went up the steep route. This did not work out too badly as it was not too hot yet and a lot of the way was in the shade anyway. It probably took less than 30 minutes to get to the top. We had been up here four years ago and once again, the views were superb. We had enjoyed it last time but this time we could recognise a lot more of the places around the island. We had perfect views of Vromolithos, Alinda, Agia Marina and Lakki as well as plenty of other islands in the area.

        <p class="diary-text">
          Last time we were here you had to pay to go into the castle itself but this time it was free so we went in again and spent 15 minutes or so walking round the walls taking more photos. We walked back down via the road and past the six windmills. Previously you could only see them from the road but today we were able to walk round them. It was an easy walk back down and we were back at Tony's by 10:20.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           We had a couple of hours by the beach although it was quite windy today and not that pleasant being outside by the sea. We had lunch on the balcony and then I went back to Lakki to buy our ferry tickets for next Sunday.... only to find that the office is closed from 15:00 to 17:50. I walked back to the apartment via the supermarket again.

           Although we had planned on a couple of days off alcohol, we decided to have a few drinks tonight. We started with wine and retsina on the balcony and then returned to Dimitris o Karaflas where we had a table booked with a sea view this time. Very good meals again although I was not as impressed with the squid as with some of the meals we have had there. We had three bottles of retsina with the meal (it is cheaper than the white wine) and returned to the balcony for a few more drinks while watching the first half of Swansea v Sheff Utd before going to bed.

           Roz went to the beach as soon as we got up this morning and I went straight out for my walk. I walked up to the castle via Pantelli Beach and the road. I did not go into it this time but came straight back down the steps to Platanos instead. From there, I extended the walk by walking down the hill to the ferry port at Agia Marina. This was closer than I thought and is only just over a mile from where we are staying. I walked back to Tony's stopping to buy cheese/spinach pies and bread on the way.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           We had a late breakfast on the balcony (the same balcony despite Roz's attempt to move to a room with a better view). Did not do a lot for the rest of the day except for reading at the beach or lazing around in the room.

           We had a very similar evening to yesterday. Drinks on the balcony, ate at Dimitris o Karaflas (excellent stifado!) and then managed to watch the whole of the Reading v Sunderland game with more wine/retsina.

        <p class="diary-text">

           Another day of not doing a lot. We had yesterday's bread with jam for breakfast on the balcony. Spent most of the rest of the day either at the beach or in the room. I walked to Lakki and back after lunch with another stop at the supermarket on the way back.

           We were awake in time to see the sunrise this morning. Our balcony faces East so although the views are not as good as in our last room here, we do get perfect views of the sun rising. After we had taken our photos, we headed straight out to walk up to the castle again. We bought pies from Mike's Bakery for breakfast which we ate on the steps of the library in Platanos again before walking up the steps.  We were earlier than three days ago so the castle was closed when we got up there but the views are just as spectacular from the area just below. We walked back past the windmills and were back in the room before 10.
		</p>
        <p class="diary-text">
           Spent most of the rest of the day at the beach. Just before 5, we walked into Lakki again. When I had been there a couple of days ago, I had seen a bar (Persiana Beer & Grill) which looked as if it sold a range of Belgium beers. It was closed when we got there but as we were both peering through the window, a bar-maid turned up and opened up for us. We had a couple of wheat beers (our first beers since getting to Greece) before going to the office to buy our ferry tickets for Sunday and then walking back to Tony's.

          Despite the amount we had drunk last night, we were awake by 6:30 to watch the sunrise again. Once again, a very nice way to start the day. After returning to bed for an hour or so, I got up again at 8:30 and went out for a final walk up to the castle for this trip. I walked up via the road and went into the castle again for another look around. I walked back down via the steps stopping at Mike's to buy pies for breakfast.

          After eating on the balcony we went down to the beach for a couple of hours. Today I joined Roz on her swim to Pantelli and back, a distance of about 2km in total. Great views of the castle and windmills from the bay at Pantelli but the beach did not look too appealing with the number of people on it. After drying off, it was back to the room for lunch and then the start of the afternoon's football
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          Swansea's game v Hull was the early kick-off on Sky so we knew we knew we would be able to watch that on Hesgoal.com and when that had finished, we were also able to watch Watford v Sunderland. Two good games and two good results.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As soon as the second game had finished, it was time to start drinking again. Tonight was our last night on Leros and it was not too different to most of the previous ones here. We had wine and retsina with crisps and cheese on the balcony before making our way up the hill to the restaurant. Excellent meals as usual and for the second night running we were given our third bottle of retsina on the house.

          We were up by 9, packed up our stuff and checked out of Tony's by about 9:45. We did not bother with a taxi this time but walked the 1.1 miles to Agia Marina, stopping at a cafe/bakery for breakfast on the way. We were at the port by 10:35 and had a wait of 50 minutes for the 11:25 catamaran. The boat arrived on time and by 12:10 we were on Kalymnos.

          We had a walk of about 20 minutes to get to Villa Melina where we were booked to stay for the next two nights. We had to wait about 45 minutes before our room was ready and we were then given a room without a balcony despite the fact that Roz had requested one. She went down to sort it out and we were moved to a much nicer room with a large terrace shared by us and one or two other rooms.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After unpacking we went for a walk around the harbour area. We went to buy our tickets to Kos but the office was closed. We walked to the nearest beach which is not far from the port but it was nothing too spectacular and not one we will bother returning to! We walked back to the hotel stopping for take-away gyros for lunch on the way. I spent the rest of the afternoon in the room while Roz went to the pool.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          As usual we started the evening with a few drinks on the terrace. While we were sat there, Roz noticed that the diamond was missing from her engagement ring. We spent a bit of time looking for it although it was always unlikely that we were ever going to find it. We had to eventually give up and carry on drinking instead.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          When we were walking round this afternoon, we had spotted a bar at the edge of the harbour that we liked the look of and decided to go there for a drink before eating. Once there, the old man that was serving us spoke no English. I managed to establish that we both wanted white wine which he was able to cope with but despite the fact that I had told him we did not want to eat anything, he kept bringing us small plates of meze type food. We just accepted everything and spent the rest of the evening there. Once we had started, there did not seem any need to go to a restaurant to eat. Not quite the evening that we had planned but an enjoyable one nevertheless. We had no idea what everything cost but the whole evening cost us €25 for almost two litres of wine and all the food. We returned to the terrace to finish the bottle of wine that we had started earlier.

          At 11:00 we went out for a walk. We had planned to go up to the castle but the monastery that is on the hill above the harbour looked more spectacular so we climbed up there instead. Climbing up at the hottest part of the day was probably not the best of ideas but it was not that hard a climb and we were up there in just under an hour. The views from the top were excellent although we could not go into the monastery itself as we were not "appropriately dressed".

          We walked down from the top to the harbour where the ferry ticket office was once again closed. We walked back to the hotel collecting pies for lunch and wine for tonight on the way. We were back just after 1, had lunch on the terrace and spent the afternoon on the pool or terrace while watching bits of the Queen's funeral.
