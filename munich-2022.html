            We left Cathy's before 7:30, collected Dave from Morriston and had an uneventful drive back to Kingsclere. After having showers and feeding Sid, we were on our way again and got to Heathrow Terminal 2 just before midday. We left the car with Meet and Great, got through security reasonably quickly and had about an hour to wait for the 13:50 Lufthansa flight to Munich. The flight left just about on time.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            We landed in Munich on time at about 4:30. We got through immigration, bought our train ticket and beer for the journey and got the 5:10 S-Bahn into the centre. We got off the train at Hackerbrucke and walked to the B&B Hotel, the same place that Roz and I had stayed at in June. We dropped off our bags, collected Hoggy and went out to start drinking.

            We were keen on eating so first stop was Bavaria a place we have been to before but not eaten in very often. I had seen that the menu looked good on the internet and the meals were all excellent. After eating, and a few beers we headed towards the old town. We stopped for one each in Augustiner Stammhaus. The standing area of the tap room was closed as was the "big dog pub" so we went instead to the pig pub for a couple.

            At about 10:30, we headed to the Hofbräuhaus where we stayed until it closed. Vaguely remember walking back to the hotel.

            A typical days drinking in Munich. I went out to buy breakfast from Lidl which we ate in the room. Roz and I went out at 11:30 and walked into the centre. We had a wander round the town stopping for more photos in the Marienplatz before meeting Dave and Hoggy in the Viktualienmarkt beer garden. As today was supposed to be the warmest day of our stay here, we wanted to spend as much time as we could in the beer gardens. We had one in there before walking to the Botanicals where we were eventually joined by Regan at about 2:30.

            After one in there, we walked to the Augustiner Keller where we spent the rest of the afternoon. Things started getting a bit messy from here. We left the beer garden just before 6 and headed towards Augustiner Bräustuben. Hoggy lost and re-found his coat as we were leaving and Regan had to be picked up from the tram lines as he managed to fall flat on his face as he crossed the road. The Bräustuben was fuller than expected and we could only get a table for one hour. We decided not to eat and just had another litre of beer each instead.

            At 7 we went back to Bavaria where we did eat again. Once again the food was very good. By the time we had eaten, Regan had stopped drinking and was asleep so I took him back to his hotel. Things are getting very confused now. I walked back into town and found the others being refused entry to the tap room as Hoggy was too drunk. We went back to the pig pub managing to lose Dave on the way. Dave eventually managed to find us but then decided to go back to the hotel.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            We all decided that we did not need to go to the Hofbräuhaus and left the pub at about 10. No recollection of walking back to the hotel. A good day!
