            We left Cathy's before 7:30, collected Dave from Morriston and had an uneventful drive back to Kingsclere. After having showers and feeding Sid, we were on our way again and got to Heathrow Terminal 2 just before midday. We left the car with Meet and Great, got through security reasonably quickly and had about an hour to wait for the 13:50 Lufthansa flight to Munich. The flight left just about on time.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            We landed in Munich on time at about 4:30. We got through immigration, bought our train ticket and beer for the journey and got the 5:10 S-Bahn into the centre. We got off the train at Hackerbrucke and walked to the B&B Hotel, the same place that Roz and I had stayed at in June. We dropped off our bags, collected Hoggy and went out to start drinking.

            We were keen on eating so first stop was Bavaria a place we have been to before but not eaten in very often. I had seen that the menu looked good on the internet and the meals were all excellent. After eating, and a few beers we headed towards the old town. We stopped for one each in Augustiner Stammhaus. The standing area of the tap room was closed as was the "big dog pub" so we went instead to the pig pub for a couple.

            At about 10:30, we headed to the Hofbräuhaus where we stayed until it closed. Vaguely remember walking back to the hotel.

            A typical days drinking in Munich. I went out to buy breakfast from Lidl which we ate in the room. Roz and I went out at 11:30 and walked into the centre. We had a wander round the town stopping for more photos in the Marienplatz before meeting Dave and Hoggy in the Viktualienmarkt beer garden. As today was supposed to be the warmest day of our stay here, we wanted to spend as much time as we could in the beer gardens. We had one in there before walking to the Botanicals where we were eventually joined by Regan at about 2:30.

         <p class="diary-text">
            After one in there, we walked to the Augustiner Keller where we spent the rest of the afternoon. Things started getting a bit messy from here. We left the beer garden just before 6 and headed towards Augustiner Bräustuben. Hoggy lost and re-found his coat as we were leaving and Regan had to be picked up from the tram lines as he managed to fall flat on his face as he crossed the road. The Bräustuben was fuller than expected and we could only get a table for one hour. We decided not to eat and just had another litre of beer each instead.

         <p class="diary-text">
            At 7 we went back to Bavaria where we did eat again. Once again the food was very good. By the time we had eaten, Regan had stopped drinking and was asleep so I took him back to his hotel. Things are getting very confused now. I walked back into town and found the others being refused entry to the tap room as Hoggy was too drunk. We went back to the pig pub managing to lose Dave on the way. Dave eventually managed to find us but then decided to go back to the hotel.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            We all decided that we did not need to go to the Hofbräuhaus and left the pub at about 10. No recollection of walking back to the hotel. A good day!
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 11th October</span>
            Another typical days drinking in Munich! We had breakfast in the room again and headed out for the day at about 10:40. We first went for a walk round the octoberfest site which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Although it finished 10 days ago, most of the "tents" were still in place. We walked round the whole site stopping to see the Bavaria statue on the way.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            Once we had completed our circuit of the site, we walked across Munich to the Hofbräukellar where we had arranged to meet the others. Regan, surprisingly turned up on time and by 12:30 we had all started drinking again. We had one beer here before walking to the Paulaner place (Paulaner am Nockherberg). The beer garden was closed which was a shame so we sat inside and had a couple of their tasting boards.
         </p>

         <p class="diary-text">
            From there, we started walking back towards town. The place we had visited previously on this route was closed so we kept going until we were just about at the Viktualienmarkt. We stopped for a beer at Der Pschorr. This was somewhere we had not been in before. It was a nice enough place but at over €6 a beer, was probably the most expensive place we have been to in Munich. After one in there, we went over the road to Giesinger Bräu - Stehausschank. This was another place we had not visited before. They had a happy hour from 4 - 6 and we happened to arrive there just after 4. Litres here were €6.90 for two hours so we stayed for a couple.

         <p class="diary-text">
            We had been flagging a bit prior to going here but a couple of litres of their beer seemed to liven us all up a bit. We left there when the happy hour ended and headed towards the Nurnberg sausage house where we had a table booked for 6:45. We stopped for one in the Schneider Bräuhaus on the way and things started to get a bit vague after that. Once again, the restaurant was very crowded and we ended up on a table upstairs. After a couple more beers and 36 sausages, we returned to the pig pub and eventually the Hofbräuhaus. A relatively early night as we left the Hofbräuhaus before 10 and were back at the hotel by 10:30

            The others were due to fly home today but Roz and I are going to stay in Landshut for a couple of days. We checked out of the hotel at 10:45 and walked to the station. We bought an all day Regio-Ticket Donau-Isar with one of the vouchers we had from our late trains in June. We also bought breakfast and provisions for the journey from Yorma's and got on the 11:24 Passau train.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            We arrived in Landshut at 12:12 and walked to the Ibis which is just about next to the station. We were initially told we could not check in until 3 but due to Roz's gold accor membership, we were given a room after about 10 minutes.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            After an hour or so in the room, we headed out for the day. We had decided that while in Landshut we would return to Freising and visit the Bräustüberl at Weihenstephan, allegedly the oldest brewery in the world. We had wanted to visit it when we stayed in Freising last year but needed a night off the beer. We decided we may as well go today as we could use the same train ticket that we had bought in Munich. We got the train at 2:30 and were in Freising 20 minutes later.

            From the station it was a pleasant walk of just over a mile up to Weihenstephan. We found the brewery and spent an enjoyable couple of hours in there. We had five beers between us as well as their mixed meat and cheese plate for lunch.

         <p class="diary-text">
            We left the brewery just before 5 and walked down into the centre of Freising. We had a few more beers in the Freisinger Augustiner and then a few more in Furtnerbräu. From here, the plan was to walk to the station and get the train back to Landshut. However, just before the station, we saw a nice looking Greek restaurant and called in there for a couple of drinks. This was not a good move! I do not remember leaving the restaurant and the next thing I do remember is being on the platform at Langenbach station about 28 km from Landshut. It would appear that we got on the correct train but had got off it too early. Although there were still plenty of trains from Freising to Landshut, none of them appeared to be stopping at Langenbach.
         </p>
         <p class="diary-text">
            After about 70 minutes of standing around on the platform, we were able to get a train back to Freising. Here we had another wait of about 30 minutes for a train to Landshut (which did stop in Langenbach!). We eventually got back to the Ibis just before midnight, about three hours after leaving the Greek restaurant.

            Roz went out to buy breakfast from Lidl/Yorma's and we ate it in the room. We went out for a walk for a couple of hours just after 11. It is about a mile from where we are staying to the centre of the old town. We walked through the main street, round the cathedral and up to the castle. The whole place is very scenic and we had great views of the town looking down from the castle.

            We did not do a lot for the rest of the day until we started drinking again at 4ish. We had our complimentary drink in the Ibis bar and then walked back into town. We started in Augustiner -  Gasthaus zur Schleuse, one of two Augustiner establishments in Landshut. After a few in there, we walked to Weißes Bräuhaus Zum Krenkl where we had a few more beers and also a meal. We then found a couple of smaller places back from the main street, Gasthaus zum Freischütz and Wirtshaus zum Hofreiter. Both of these were good particularly the second one which had Hofbräu Octoberfest beer. We had a slightly more straitforward journey home tonight and were back in the hotel before 11.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 14th October</span>
            We had planned to walk into town again but could not be bothered. We both went to Lidl to buy stuff for breakfast and stayed in the room until we checked out at 11:30. We caught the 11:59 train directly to Munich airport and after going to McDonalds for lunch had an hour or so to wait for our 14:45 Lufthansa flight back to Heathrow.
