            We left Kingsclere at 9:30. We had booked a taxi for 9:45 but it arrived early which meant that we could get the 9:58 train from Basingstoke. Despite it being the Jubilee weekend, the trains were not as busy as expected and we were in Waterloo on time 45 minutes or so later. We got the tube to St Pancras where we arrived just after 11. Our train was not due to depart until 13:31 but we went to the Eurostar terminal first to check the queues. There has been a lot of disruption in the last week or so but the whole place seemed fairly quiet with no queuing at all meaning we had time to go to the Wetherspoons for our first beer of the trip.

			We headed off to the terminal again at midday buying food and drink for the journey on the way. All quite smooth getting into the waiting area and our train to Paris left on time. We had a couple of beers and our Jubilee pork pies on the train and arrived at Gare du Nord just before 5pm French time. We left the station and started walking towards Gare d l'Est where our next train was due to depart from at 18:55. The area between the two stations was pretty rough looking but we found a reasonable looking cafe - Cafe les Deux Gares - that had its own beer for €5 a pint so we stopped in there for a drink.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had only planned to have one in there but stayed for a couple as the weather was not ideal for wandering around. It was grey and humid when we went in there and was raining heavily by the time we had finished our first drink. The storm had passed although it was still raining when we left at 6:30 but it was only a short walk from there to the station.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At the station, the departure boards showed that our train was delayed by ten minutes. We bought beer and bread for the journey and waited boarded the train by about 7pm. It soon became obvious that the train was going to be delayed by more than ten minutes. When it did eventually leave, it traveled very slowly for about 90 minutes and then stopped completely. By 9pm, we were stationary on the outskirts of Paris, about 11km from Gare d l'Est.... and we had finished our beer!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did not really know what was going on as all the announcements were in French but not long after this, the train started heading back to Paris and by about 9:30, we were back at Gare d l'Est. We were told to speak to SNCF staff about alternative options or overnight accommodation but we saw that the 20:25 Strasbourg train was not due to depart until 22:15 so we got straight on that. Everything in the station was closed by now but I found a shop just outside that had a good range of Belgian beers. I bought a couple each for the journey and we were reasonably content again.

        <p class="diary-text">
			After sitting on this train for about half an hour there was another announcement and we were told to move to yet another train (or possibly the first one again). There was no indication of when this one would leave. At about 11:30 we were told that the train would not be leaving tonight (the earlier storm had caused problems and there was no electricity on part of the line), there was no alternative accommodation but we would be able to sleep on the train until things started moving in the morning. We had also run out of beer again. A lot of people had given up by this point and gone home so the train was relatively empty.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			I was on my way out of the station for a second time to replenish our supplies when several people started running towards the train and I was told that it would be leaving shortly. It eventually left at around midnight. We had a few drinks from the bar and finally got into Strasbourg five hours late at 1:40. Fortunately, our hotel - Ibis Styles Strasbourg Centre Gare - was only a couple of minutes walk from the station. We checked in and went straight to bed.

            We were up by 9 for breakfast. Neither of us were too hungover despite the amount we had drunk yesterday but we were both tired - it had been a long day! We stayed in the room until 11 and then went out for a couple of hours of sight-seeing. We walked down to the "Ponts Couverts" which are only a few minutes walk from the hotel, walked across them all to Barrage Vauban and then spent an hour or so wandering round Petite France and Grande-Île. Here we saw most of the other sights we were interested in including the Cathedral. All very pleasant for walking around.

			We bought bread and pate for lunch which we ate sat on the steps of a church, found Académie de la Bière, a bar which we plan to visit this evening and then returned to the room for a couple of hours. We went out again at 5 and went straight back to Académie de la Bière. I had read about this bar before getting here and it was an excellent place. They had a range of about 20 beers on tap and a happy hour between 5 and 7 when all of them were €5 a pint. Roz got them to put the Wales v Ukraine game on the tele's when it started at 6 so we were quite content in there for a few hours drinking the 6.5% Perle IPA.

			We left the bar not long after the football had finished and went to a pizza restaurant that we had seen this morning at the far end of the covered bridges. This was another very nice place by the side of one of the canals. We had excellent meals with a litre of wine and only vaguely remember returning to the hotel.

            We checked out of the hotel at 8 and walked back to the station to wait for the 8:46 train to Karlsruhe. The train came in on time
