            We left Cathy's before 7:30, collected Dave from Morriston and had an uneventful drive back to Kingsclere. After having showers and feeding Sid, we were on our way again and got to Heathrow Terminal 2 just before midday. We left the car with Meet and Great, got through security reasonably quickly and had about an hour to wait for the 13:50 Lufthansa flight to Munich. The flight left just about on time.

            We landed in Munich on time at about 4:30. We got through immigration, bought our train ticket and beer for the journey and got the 5:10 S-Bahn into the centre. We got off the train at Hackerbrucke and walked to the B&B Hotel, the same place that Roz and I had stayed at in June. We dropped off our bags, collected Hoggy and went out to start drinking.

            We were keen on eating so first stop was Bavaria a place we have been to before but not eaten in very often. I had seen that the menu looked good on the internet and the meals were all excellent. After eating, and a few beers we headed towards the old town. We stopped for one each in Augustiner Stammhaus. The standing area of the tap room was closed as was the "big dog pub" so we went instead to the pig pub for a couple.

            At about 10:30, we headed to the Hofbräuhaus where we stayed until it closed. Vaguely remember walking back to the hotel.
