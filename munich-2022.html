            We left Kingsclere at 9:30. We had booked a taxi for 9:45 but it arrived early which meant that we could get the 9:58 train from Basingstoke. Despite it being the Jubilee weekend, the trains were not as busy as expected and we were in Waterloo on time 45 minutes or so later. We got the tube to St Pancras where we arrived just after 11. Our train was not due to depart until 13:31 but we went to the Eurostar terminal first to check the queues. There has been a lot of disruption in the last week or so but the whole place seemed fairly quiet with no queuing at all meaning we had time to go to the Wetherspoons for our first beer of the trip.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We headed off to the terminal again at midday buying food and drink for the journey on the way. All quite smooth getting into the waiting area and our train to Paris left on time. We had a couple of beers and our Jubilee pork pies on the train and arrived at Gare du Nord just before 5pm French time. We left the station and started walking towards Gare d l'Est where our next train was due to depart from at 18:55. The area between the two stations was pretty rough looking but we found a reasonable looking cafe - Cafe les Deux Gares - that had its own beer for €5 a pint so we stopped in there for a drink.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had only planned to have one in there but stayed for a couple as the weather was not ideal for wandering around. It was grey and humid when we went in there and was raining heavily by the time we had finished our first drink. The storm had passed although it was still raining when we left at 6:30 but it was only a short walk from there to the station.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At the station, the departure boards showed that our train was delayed by ten minutes. We bought beer and bread for the journey and waited boarded the train by about 7pm. It soon became obvious that the train was going to be delayed by more than ten minutes. When it did eventually leave, it traveled very slowly for about 90 minutes and then stopped completely. By 9pm, we were stationary on the outskirts of Paris, about 11km from Gare d l'Est.... and we had finished our beer!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did not really know what was going on as all the announcements were in French but not long after this, the train started heading back to Paris and by about 9:30, we were back at Gare d l'Est. We were told to speak to SNCF staff about alternative options or overnight accommodation but we saw that the 20:25 Strasbourg train was not due to depart until 22:15 so we got straight on that. Everything in the station was closed by now but I found a shop just outside that had a good range of Belgian beers. I bought a couple each for the journey and we were reasonably content again.
        </p>

        <p class="diary-text">
			After sitting on this train for about half an hour there was another announcement and we were told to move to yet another train (or possibly the first one again). There was no indication of when this one would leave. At about 11:30 we were told that the train would not be leaving tonight (the earlier storm had caused problems and there was no electricity on part of the line), there was no alternative accommodation but we would be able to sleep on the train until things started moving in the morning. We had also run out of beer again. A lot of people had given up by this point and gone home so the train was relatively empty.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			I was on my way out of the station for a second time to replenish our supplies when several people started running towards the train and I was told that it would be leaving shortly. It eventually left at around midnight. We had a few drinks from the bar and finally got into Strasbourg five hours late at 1:40. Fortunately, our hotel - Ibis Styles Strasbourg Centre Gare - was only a couple of minutes walk from the station. We checked in and went straight to bed.

            We were up by 9 for breakfast. Neither of us were too hungover despite the amount we had drunk yesterday but we were both tired - it had been a long day! We stayed in the room until 11 and then went out for a couple of hours of sight-seeing. We walked down to the "Ponts Couverts" which are only a few minutes walk from the hotel, walked across them all to Barrage Vauban and then spent an hour or so wandering round Petite France and Grande-Île. Here we saw most of the other sights we were interested in including the Cathedral. All very pleasant for walking around.

			We bought bread and pate for lunch which we ate sat on the steps of a church, found Académie de la Bière, a bar which we plan to visit this evening and then returned to the room for a couple of hours. We went out again at 5 and went straight back to Académie de la Bière. I had read about this bar before getting here and it was an excellent place. They had a range of about 20 beers on tap and a happy hour between 5 and 7 when all of them were €5 a pint. Roz got them to put the Wales v Ukraine game on the tele's when it started at 6 so we were quite content in there for a few hours drinking the 6.5% Perle IPA.

			We left the bar not long after the football had finished and went to a pizza restaurant that we had seen this morning at the far end of the covered bridges. This was another very nice place by the side of one of the canals. We had excellent meals with a litre of wine and only vaguely remember returning to the hotel.

            We checked out of the hotel at 8 and walked back to the station to wait for the 8:46 train to Karlsruhe. The train came in on time and we were in Karlsruhr by 9:26. We had a wait of just over 20 minutes for the next ICE to Munich, which also departed on time. We arrived in Munich main station at 13:12. The F.A.'s ticket collection point was just over the road from the station so we picked up our tickets on our way to the B&B Hotel where we had booked a room for two nights. They let us check in straight away. We put our things in the room and were on our way out before 2pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We knew we would be meeting Steve later so decided to visit a few of our favourite places first. We started with the Augustiner Stammhaus. The beer hall bit of this place was closed but we were able to sit in the restaurant and drink in there. We then started walking out to the Paulaner beer garden but only got as far as the Viktualienmarkt. The last time we were here, it was all table service due to covid restrictions. When we saw that it had returned to normal, we decided to stop for a couple.

        <p class="diary-text">
			We stopped for one in the Schneider Bräuhaus before walking back to Augustiner Stammhaus to meet Steve and Shiela who had just got back from a day trip. We stayed in there while they went back to the hotel and by this time, were getting quite pissed. When Steve returned, we went back to Marienplatz where we found Mick, Bob, Thomas, etc. We got more seats and stayed drinking with them until close to midnight. Don't remember walking back to the hotel!

            Woke up to find that the weather forecast had been correct and it was raining heavily with no sign of it stopping. Roz was feeling rough after yesterdays session so I went out to Lidl to buy breakfast which we ate in the room. By midday the rain had almost completely stopped. I arranged to meet Roz at the Hofbräuhaus and went out for a walk.... mainly just going a long way round to the Hofbräuhaus.
        </p>

			We met outside the Hofbräuhaus just after 1pm and went inside for our first beer of the day. I had seen a group of England fans being turned away so was unsure about whether or not we would be allowed in but for a change we got past the bouncers without any problems. It was fairly full inside due to the weather and there were plenty of fans around from both England and Germany.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left there after one drink and went back to Schneider Bräuhaus for another drink and lunch. We would have stayed for a second in there but the service was poor so we crossed the road to the Paulaner place over the road. This place looked as if it was permanently closed the last couple of times we have been in Munich but had reopened again albeit without the pig outside. After one in there, we walked through Marienplatz to the Nurnberg sausage house. We got a table outside and were able to sit and watch a selection of our fans who had been allowed to buy bottles and drink in the area between the restaurants and the cathedral while being watched by several van loads of police.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had thought about going back to the Hofbräuhaus but Steve, Mark and Mick had returned from their trip to Dachau and had been refused entry for some reason so we decided to stay where we were. Steve came and joined us while the other two headed off towards the ground. We left for the ground at 7:15, an hour and a half before kick-off. The U-Bahn was packed and took about twice as long as it should have done due to frequent lengthy stops but we got to the station nearest to the ground just after 8.
        </p>

			We had no problems getting into the ground this time and were in our seats in plenty of time. A reasonably enjoyable game and not a bad result in the end. Roz and I left immediately after the final whistle and joined the queues to get back on the U-Bahn. The journey this time was slightly better - a bit less crowded and a lot quicker. We got the S-Bahn back from Marienplatz to the station and walked back to the hotel from there. Neither of us could be bothered to go for another drink so went straight to bed when we got back just after midnight.

            We were awake a bit earlier and feeling slightly healthier than we did yesterday. We said goodbye to Steve and Mick and checked out of the hotel just before 10. We made our way to the station, bought breakfast to eat on the train and boarded the 10:32 to Oberau. We were heading for Mittenwald and the train should have taken us all the way there but due to the train accident last week, the trains were terminating at Oberau.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We knew we would be on a replacement bus service from Oberau to Garmisch as the wreckage has not yet been cleared from the track, but once on the train  we were told that there would be another bus from Garmisch for reasons we do not know. As it was, both the replacement buses were OK. The first journey was slow as the main to Garmisch is also closed but we did not have to wait long for the second bus to Mittenwald. We got into Mittenwald at 13:, only 50 minutes later than if things had been running normally. We had been told by a couple of people that the whole thing was "chaos" but compared to the delays that something like that would have caused in England, it was all relatively smooth.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			It was a short walk to The Post Hotel, a hotel we have stayed in before about 20 - 25 years ago. We had booked a room with a balcony for two nights and then a standard room for the third night (no balcony rooms available). They appear to have combined the bookings and given us a suite for two nights. It has two bedrooms, one of which has a large seating area and also has two balconies with superb views in both directions. We both felt like just lazing around in the room for the rest of the day but as today was probably the only day of good weather we are expecting during our stay, we decided we should go out for a walk. We ate lunch on the balcony (East) and headed out at about 2:30.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had been given quite a lot of information about local walks and chose to do the Leutascher Geisterklamn gorge. This was a four mile walk from our hotel that took us up the "Ghost Gorge" and along the "Goblin Trail". The walk back through the gorge was along a metal walkway suspended 40m above the river with spectacular views down. The highlight was the panoramic bridge at the end of the walk.

			After showers, we had a couple of drinks on the balcony (South) before going out to eat. It had started to rain by this time so we did not want to go too far. We saw a place a few doors down from the hotel advertising schnitzels for €10.90 so went in there. It was sort of in between a cafe and a restaurant and we were the only ones in there for most of the time, but it was nice enough and the food was fine. After we had eaten we went to The Alpen Rose hotel which is just about next to ours. This was a much nicer traditional Bavarian place with a lot more people in it so a bit more atmosphere. We had a couple of drinks in there before returning to our room. It was too cold to sit on the balcony so we had a final couple of drinks in our living room area before going to bed.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 9th June</span>
            As expected the weather was poor today. The temperature was not predicted to get above 12°c, the clouds were obscuring the most of the mountains and the rain looked set to last at least for the whole of the morning. We had breakfast in the hotel and then spent an hour or so in the room. The rain had eased sufficiently by 10:30 for us to go for a walk around the centre of Mittenwald looking at the painted shops and houses. Also looked into buying warmer/water-proof walking jackets but decided they were too expensive and would be another thing to have to carry home.
		</p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			I returned to the room by 11:30 for my phone appointment with the micro-biology team in Basingstoke. When they did eventually call, it all seemed to be good news re my infection and lung issues. Hopefully, that is just about the end of it all!

			We eventually decided that we would go out for a walk at about 1:30. We decided to walk to Krun which is about 6 miles away and get the bus back. The rain was not too heavy when we started out despite our lack of properly waterproof clothing. We thought about giving up after 30 minutes but it eased again and we kept going. At the half-way point, we decided to head back to Mittenwald. If we had continued to Krun, although we have free bus passes, we would have to wait around in wet clothes and getting straight back to the hotel to dry off seemed a more appealing idea. There were signs for an alternative route back so we did not have to go back the way we came and we completed the six mile walk in just under two hours
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch on the East balcony again before walking out to the supermarket to buy more alcohol, mainly to take home.
