            A slightly  different start to a tournament as we were still at home. After being initially disappointed about the format of the tournament, and then the fact that England will play most of their games at Wembley, these two things have meant that we will at least get to some of the games in the next few weeks. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have definitely got tickets for the three group games which were issued electronically as with the Nations League in Portugal, but do not know what will happen after that. We should have tickets for England's second round game if they win the group and it is played at Wembley, but not if they come second or third. It is unlikely that we will be able to travel to games other than in London but should be OK if they increase the capacity for the semi-final or final
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">However, we do not travel to London for the first game until tomorrow so the first game was watched at home. Mark Vickery joined us for the game and we then went down to The Swan for a couple but it was a relatively early night

            We left the car in Basingstoke and were on the 10:30 train up to Waterloo. We arrived in London at 11:19 and were pleased to see that the station had been decorated in Euro 2020 flags/logs, etc. It was starting to feel like a proper tournament!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We left the station and started our walk along the river towards Tower Bridge where we are staying for the next couple of days. We had a few stops along the way. The first at Doggett's, then The Rake and the Pommeler's Rest before getting to The Dean Swift where we had a table booked to watch Wales v Switzerland. This was an excellent pub with good beer and a reasonable range of tapas. We ate in here during the football and then crossed the river to our hotel.
