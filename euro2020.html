            A slightly  different start to a tournament as we were still at home. After being initially disappointed about the format of the tournament, and then the fact that England will play most of their games at Wembley, these two things have meant that we will at least get to some of the games in the next few weeks. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have definitely got tickets for the three group games which were issued electronically as with the Nations League in Portugal, but do not know what will happen after that. We should have tickets for England's second round game if they win the group and it is played at Wembley, but not if they come second or third. It is unlikely that we will be able to travel to games other than in London but should be OK if they increase the capacity for the semi-final or final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">However, we do not travel to London for England's first game until tomorrow so the first game was watched at home. Mark Vickery joined us for the game and we then went down to The Swan for a couple but it was a relatively early night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 12th June</span>
            We left the car in Basingstoke and were on the 10:30 train up to Waterloo. We arrived in London at 11:19 and were pleased to see that the station had been decorated in the Euro 2020 flags/logos, etc. It was starting to feel like a proper tournament!
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_001.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the station and started our walk along the river towards Tower Bridge where we are staying for the next couple of days. We stopped for a few drinks along the way. The first at Doggett's, then The Rake and finally The Pommelers Rest before getting to The Dean Swift where we had a table booked to watch Wales v Switzerland. This was an excellent pub, just down from the bridge, with very good beer and a reasonable range of tapas. We ate in here during the football and then walked across the river to check in to The Tower Hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had paid a bit extra to get a room overlooking Tower Bridge and the view was excellent - certainly the best view we have ever had from any London hotel bedroom. We had an almost perfect view of Tower Bridge and The Shard and could also see plenty of bits of other landmarks. The room itself was also very nice although we could have done with the air-conditioning being a bit better. Roz went out to buy drinks and we had another beer in the room while half watching the Denmark v Finland game and half looking out of the window. The Christian Eriksen incident did briefly put a bit of a dampener on proceedings but he recovered consciousness and we headed out again for the rest of the evening.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            We headed back over the river and walked along the South bank. The pubs that were actually on the river such as the Horniman at Hays were quite busy with queues to get in so we went slightly inland. We had a couple in The Mudlark, two more in the Barrowboy and Banker and another two in our final pub for the day, The Hung Drawn and Quartered. We had a couple more drinks in the room while briefly joining the weekly video chat to end the night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 13th June - 14:00 England v Croatia</span>
            We left the hotel at 9:30 and walked to The Founders Arms where we had a table booked for breakfast with Steve. We ate there sat outside in the sun and had our first drinks of the day. Full English breakfast with Double Chocolate Stout. A good start to the day! Steve left after the first drink to meet Gavin. Roz and I stayed for a second and then walked to The Fire Station at Waterloo Station. We had one in there, bought a few cans and a sandwich from the Tesco over the road and then got the tube up to Wembley. By this time we were really starting to get excited about the football.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text"> 
            The tube journey to the ground was a lot easier due to the reduced capacity and we were at Wembley Park station by 12:30. We managed to find a bench to sit down at on Wembley Way and it was a surprisingly good spot to sit in the sun while we drank our cans. We had joked about "sitting on Wembley Way with cans" but this was an enjoyable half an hour sat looking at the ground and watching the crowd arriving. We started to walk towards the ground about an hour before kick-off. We had our covid-19 vaccination statuses checked and had no problems getting through the ticket checks with our electronic tickets.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_003.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After buying a few things from the shop, we headed into the ground. With an attendance of only about 18,500 getting in through the turnstiles was a much less stressful experience than usual. We met up with Steve again along with Mick, Gary and eventually Sheila in the ground and still had time to have one more drink before taking our seats in the upper tier.  
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            It really did feel good to be back at a competitive football match again and the build up had been superb. The match itself, unlike some days out watching England, was as good as the build up with a good performance and excellent result. We stayed in the ground to applaud the players before heading back to Wembley Park station where Steve, Roz and I got the tube back to Waterloo. Again, a much easier experience with the reduced capacity.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in The Hole in the Wall while watching Austria v North Macedonia. Steve then got the train home while Roz and I walked back to the hotel via a couple more pubs. A lot of the pubs in the area were closed but we had a drink in Doggett's again and then stopped for a couple at The Market Porter. We stopped for a pint at The Two Bridges Ale House to watch the end of The Netherlands v Ukraine match before walking back to the hotel. An excellent day!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 14th June</span>
            We left the hotel at 9:30 and walked to The Liberty Bounds at Tower Hill. We met up with some of Roz's friends (Claire and Alan) who had just arrived in London. We all had breakfast there before we walked back to Waterloo and caught the 12:05 train back to Basingstoke. We walked back to the car and were back in the house in time to watch Scotland losing their first game to Czech Republic.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We did not pay too much attention to the second game of the day - Poland v Slovakia - but just about managed to stay awake to watch the end of Sweden's 0 - 0 draw with Spain.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 15th June</span>
            Only two games today. We watched both at home - Portugal v Hungary at 17:00 and then the Germany v France game at 20:00.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 16th June</span>
            Watched the Wales v Turkey game at 17:00 and bits of the Russia v Finland game at 14:00 but missed the Italy v Switzerland game due to being at the Waterwitch with Aleks and Andi.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th June</span>
            Volunteered at the fire station for five hours in the morning then home for the days football. Did not watch much of the North Macedonia v Ukraine game but did see Denmark v Belgium and most of The Netherlands v Austria.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 18th June - 20:00 England v Scotland</span>
            After an early trip to the gym, we drove into Basingstoke, left the car behind the station and got a train into London at 11:15. After the glorious weather at the weekend, today was cold with heavy rain as we headed towards Clapham Junction. We arrived in Clapham Junction at about midday, walked around for a bit while Roz had a coffee and were in The Falcon by 12:15.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We had managed to book a range of different tables for various times and amounts of people but once inside were able to merge some, cancel others and extend one to give us a table for six until 6pm. Steve turned up with Jer and Mick at about 12:45 and Mark joined us at about 14:00. (Jer had taken Thomas' ticket as he was still stuck in Poland and Mark was the only one not going to the game)
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_004.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">It was an enjoyable afternoon. The beer range was not as good as it can be in The Falcon but it was good enough. We ate at 4ish and again, the food was very good. The whole thing was pretty good value as well as we had another voucher that gave us 25% off everything. We paid our bill just before 6pm (slightly too early in retrospect), said goodbye to Mark, who was staying in the area to watch the game, and got the 17:58 train to Willesden Junction. From there, it was three stops on the tube to Wembley Central. We walked to the ground and were through the turnstiles about an hour before kick-off. It was only Roz and I drinking by this stage so we had a couple more ciders on the concourse before going up to take our seats just before kick-off.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            Whereas on Sunday, the match was every bit as enjoyable as the build up, this one certainly was not. Not quite as bad as the one in Cape Town in 2010 but it did bring back memories of that game. Whereas the game in Cape Town was disappointing because it was when we realised just how bad a team we were, this game just seemed really frustrating as our expectations were so much higher. We did not need to be so defensive against a team like Scotland and the fact that we have so much attacking talent not being used made it a lot worse. A draw was not that bad a result in the great scheme of things but it felt like it at the time. A lot of this may have been due to the fact that everyone was so keen to get the win over Scotland!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The journey home was uneventful - train to Willesden Junction, another to Clapham Junction and back in Basingstoke round about midnight.

            I drove to Basingstoke to collect my bike in the morning. We went out for a 25 mile ride at midday and spent the rest of the afternoon watching the football. Started drinking during the Germany v Portugal game and then joined the J-Team video call (Canada night)

            Hangover and slight cold. Did not do a lot all day. Only two games today and both played at the same time. Watched Italy v Wales at 17:00.

            Parked the car at Basingstoke station again and were on a train up to London by 11:15. We were in Waterloo by midday. We were booked into the Premier Inn at Blackfriars but could not check in until 2pm so started our pub crawl as soon as we left the station. We stopped for one in The Understudy, a craft beer bar attached to The National Gallery. From there, we crossed the river, walked along Fleet Street to The Hack and Hop, a pub we had not been to before.... and will probably not go to again as it is being demolished in September!
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_005.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
			We checked into the hotel (which was just round the corner from the pub) at 2, put our bags in the room and headed straight out to The Black Friar, one of our favourite pubs in London. After one in there, we walked round the corner for one in The Cockpit and then walked towards Smithfield Market stopping for another in The Viaduct Tavern. There were a few pubs in the Smithfield area that we had planned to go to but The Old Red Cow was closed and The Hand and Shears did not have a tele so we went instead into The Butcher's Hook and Cleaver, a large Fullers pub. We had a few in there while watching the Austria v Ukraine game and also shared a very good bar-b-q platter.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			We returned to The Hand and Shears for one when the game had finished. This was another very nice pub but we really should not have needed to sit by an open fire on the 21st June!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we left The Hand and Shears and headed for The Farringdon Tap. I'm not sure why we were heading for this pub as it was not on the list but it turned out to be a very good choice. It was a nice craft beer pub with an excellent IPA from Northern Monk and a big tele for the Belgium v Finland game. I can not remember the finer points of this game but the result means that whatever happens tomorrow, England are into the second round.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			We had a few pints during the game and I don't remember anything about leaving the pub or getting back to the hotel!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 22nd June - 20:00 Czech Republic v England</span>
            We went out for breakfast at McDonalds at about 10 before returning to the room for showers. We headed out for the day at 12:15 and went first to The Jerusalem Tavern - another of our favourite pubs in London but one that does not open at weekends so we do not go there that often. Although we could happily have stayed in there a while, we just had one pint before walking to The Doric Arch at Euston Station where we had arranged to meet Steve and Sheila at 14:00. We were there just about on time and spent a few hours there during which time we were joined by Neil who we had met in Middlesbrough. 
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_006.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We all stayed in the pub until 5ish when the others headed up to Wembley to meet more friends in "The Box Park". Roz and I did not really know what The Box Park was but it did not look like the sort of place we wanted to be in so we went to The Euston Tap for a couple more beers instead. We bought food and a couple of bottles from the Sainsbury's at Euston station and then got the Metropolitan Line up to Wembley Park. We then sat on Wembley Way at the same table we had been at nine days ago, ate our sandwiches and had a final beer before going into the  ground.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We met up with everyone again inside the ground and took our seats in the upper tier about 15 minutes before kick-off. Again, it was not the greatest of games but the 1 - 0 win means England have won their group without conceding a goal so we can not really complain. The win also means we will be back in Wembley in a weeks time for the second round game. Although this may not be that good news in terms of who we will be playing, it means we will have home advantage with a 45,000 crowd and it means that we get to go to at least one more match.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We left the ground almost straight away after the final whistle and got the train straight back to Farringdon. We bought more sandwiches and a bottle of wine and returned to the room to watch the highlights of the game on Match of the Day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 23rd June</span>
            We had breakfast from Greggs and ate it on a bench by St Paul's Cathedral. We returned to the hotel collected our things and walked back to Waterloo via the Victoria Embankment. We made it to Waterloo just in time for the 10:05 train and were back in Basingstoke before 11:00.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We both went out on our bikes for a couple of hours before the first game at 17:00. Very hard work after the amount of alcohol consumed  in the last few days! We watched the Spain v Slovakia game and then had an enjoyable evening watching the end of Group F... the results of which mean that we will be playing Germany next Tuesday at Wembley.

            Did not do a lot all day again. The weather was not great again so could not be bothered to go out on the bike. Spent most of the day lying on the settee waiting for the football to start at 17:00. Watched Czech Republic v The Netherlands and Belgium v Portugal. Both were reasonable games without being too exciting.

            Got to Basingstoke at round about the same time as usual but found there was a lot of disruption on the trains. We wanted to go into Victoria today, not Waterloo so had to get a slow train to Woking, change there for Clapham Junction and then get another train to Victoria. Finally got into Victoria at 1pm.

            We are staying the next two nights at The Copthorne in Kensington, about an hours walk from Victoria. We broke the walk up with a few Cask Marque pub stops. We started at The Duke of Wellington, a quite nice Shepherd Neame pub. The Admiral Codrington was closed and the Crown only had Doombar so next stop was The Anglesea Arms which was also OK. The Bolton was an excellent Dutch pub that was taking down its Euro 2020 flags as we arrived. They had a very good range of Dutch beers so we had a couple in there before finishing the walk to the hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			We checked into the hotel at about 4pm. Not quite as nice view as we had a couple of weeks ago but a nice enough room and very good value for London at £110 for two nights. We went out again almost straight away and continued our Cask Marque pub crawl. We had one in The Windsor Castle but they did not have a tele so we went to the Uxbridge Arms (a pub we have been in before) for the first half of the Croatia v Spain game. We moved to The Hillgate at half time and saw the end of the game and extra time in The Prince Albert. We moved to The Sun in Splendour for the France v Switzerland game and walked back to The Devonshire Arms (the closest pub to our hotel) for most of the second half and extra time/penalties.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">It was an excellent day with some very good pubs and both the matches were superb to watch. There was a pretty good atmosphere in the Devonshire Arms, or about as good an atmosphere as you can get in a pub at the moment, with a few French fans and plenty of people supporting the Swiss. Unbelievable result at the end and the best team in the tournament are now out. Just need to beat the Germans now!!

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 29th June - 20:00 England v Germany</span>
            We had an excellent breakfast at the hotel (included with our room), had showers and headed out for the day at about 10:15. We had arranged to meet Steve in The Doric Arch again. We had plenty of time so decided to walk the 3.2 miles to Euston via Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and across central London. We were at the pub by 11:30..... to discover that it does not open until midday. We walked to the Prince Arthur, just around the corner and had one in there while waiting.
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_008.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            The area around Euston was full of England fans and it was very noticeable that the crowd was going to be bigger today. We were quite lucky to get a table in The Doric Arch and were initially told we could only stay for an hour but in the end we did  get the table for most of the afternoon. We met Steve and Neil in there as well as three more people who we have seen before with Steve's group. Steve and Neil only stayed for a couple before heading up to Wembley, We had a few more with the others before they left and then one more before heading to The Euston Tap. At 3:30ish, we got the tube from Euston Square up to Wembley Park.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            We headed to our usual table on Wembley Way but it started raining heavily just after we had got there so we spent most of our time there stood with other fans under a tree trying to stay dry. When the rain eased, we continued walking up to the ground, collected free t-shirts from one of the sponsors and were inside about 15 minutes before kick-off.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            Once again, it was not the most entertaining of matches but the eventual result and the fact that it was against Germany made it one of the best England games we have ever been to. The atmosphere was excellent, particularly after the goals had gone in. Not only a very good result but it really does give us as good a chance of getting to a final as we are ever going to get. We stayed around after the final whistle to see the lap of honour and then Roz and I got the tube back to The Doric Arch. Steve joined us an hour or so later and we stayed there for the Ukraine v Sweden game before getting the tube back to Kensington. We were back in the hotel by midnight. Another very good day out!

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 30th June</span>
            Left the hotel at about 10:30, got the tube to Victoria, a train to Clapham Junction and another back to Basingstoke. All connections were reasonably quick today and we were back in Basingstoke just after midday. Totally knackered after the last couple of days!

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st July - Wimbledon</span>
            Another trip up to London but not for football this time. Roz had managed to get two tickets for No. 1 Court at Wimbledon for the day today. I had never been before so was quite keen to go along as well. We drove to Basingstoke as usual and got a train just before 10am. Unusually, SouthWestern Trains had had the sense to stop the fast London trains at Wimbledon making the journey a lot easier than expected and we arrived in Wimbledon just after 10:30. We walked up from the station and got to the tennis courts at about 11am. There were no queues to get in. We had our covid statuses checked in the same way they do at Wembley and also had no problems with our electronic tickets, although unlike at Wembley, they did actually check our id's here.       
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_009.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            The matches did not start on Court 1 until 1pm so we had a quick look around and then found seats on Court 17 for the ladies singles match between Yulia Putintseva and Paula Badosa - two players I had never heard of! Although probably not the most exciting tennis match I had ever seen, it was the first one I had seen live and it was good to see it all from so close to the players. This match conveniently finished by about 12:30 so we could take our time getting to Court 1, stopping to look round the shop and at Henman Hill on the way. We had pretty good seats at one end and we were sat down in time to eat our sandwiches before the start of the first match. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We saw two men's singles matches - Alex Bolt v Cameron Norrie and Carlos Alcaraz v Daniil Medvedev. These were not great matches as they were both a bit one-sided but it did mean that we got to see a British player win and also saw the number 2 seed playing. The third match was the best match of the day - Victoria Azarenka v Sorana Cîrstea. This match was a lot closer with Cîrstea winning in third set.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">By the time the third match had finished it was about 7:30 and we left Wimbledon about 15 minutes later. Despite the fact that I am not a big fan of tennis, it had been a very enjoyable day, probably made better by only having 50% of the number of people inside. We walked back to the station and again were surprised to find that there was a fast non-stop train to Basingstoke about 10 minutes after we got there. Back in Basingstoke by 8:50.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 2nd July</span>
            The first Friday since the start of lockdown last year that we have not had any alcohol as we were still in need of a few healthier days after the amount we had drunk on Monday and Tuesday. I was at the fire station in the morning. We watched both of the first two quarter finals in the evening and had an early night.       
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 3rd July - 20:00 Ukraine v England</span>
            For the first time since 2002, England were playing a knock-out match at a major tournament and we were not going to be there. I went out on my bike for a couple of hours and then spent most of the afternoon getting progressively more nervous while trying to resist the temptation to start drinking too early.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We did start on the beer at half time in the Denmark v Czech Republic game. The result of this means that England would face Denmark if we beat Ukraine. We joined the weekly video call at 7:00 for 50 minutes until the teams came out in Rome.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            The England game was more comfortable than we could possibly have hoped for. England were totally in control from the first few minutes and apart from a 10 minute period at the end of the first half, the result never really looked in doubt. By a few minutes into the second half the game was just about all over and we now have another semi-final to look forward to on Wednesday at Wembley. It was a bit strange having to watch it at home instead of being there but an enjoyable evening nonetheless.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th July</span>
            We had our access codes sent to us just before 1pm and Steve had bought our semi-final tickets a few minutes later. We booked our hotel for Tuesday and Wednesday nights and also a cancellable room for the weekend of the final. Did not do a lot else all day apart from an hour or so on the bike.

            Once again, we left the car in Basingstoke and got the 11:35 train up to Waterloo. We were staying at the London Farringdon Travelodge this time so got the tube to Euston and went for our first beer of the day in The Somers Town Coffee House, a pub that had been recommended to us by Mark. We had a couple of drinks in there before walking to the hotel. The hotel was better than expected as the room was air-conditioned and fairly new. After dropping off our bags, we headed straight out to begin the days pub crawl.
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_011.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We had a list of about 10 pubs that we planned to go to but got distracted before we got to the first one. We spotted The Exmouth Arms which looked a nice pub and sold another good beer from the Northern Monk Brewery. We ended up staying for three drinks in here and also booked a table for the first semi-final later.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            From here, we walked to The Green, a cask marque pub. This was another nice pub and we had a couple in there while watching Wimbledon. We went from there to The Jerusalem Tavern. This should have been the first pub of the pub crawl but we were already quite pissed by the time we got there. We were also in need of food by now but their kitchen was not open on Tuesday so we made do with sharing a pork pie - not really enough food for the amount we were drinking in retrospect!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            After a few in The Jerusalem Tavern, we headed back to The Exmouth Arms stopping for a swift half in The Betsey Trotwood on the way. This area of London seems to be full of decent pubs and we would happily have stayed in here for longer if it was not for the football. We got back to The Exmouth Arms to find our reserved table in front of the big screen. I don't remember too much about the football but apparently we stayed in there for five drinks. I had to go back to The Betsey Trotwood to look for Roz's credit card which she eventually found under our table but that is the last thing that I do remember.

            Woke up and had to look at my phone to find out who had won last night's game! No recollection of the result or the penalties.

            <p class="diary-text">
            As a lot of yesterday's drunkenness was due to not eating enough, we started the day with a Wetherspoon's breakfast at The Sir John Oldcastle next to Farringdon station. We returned to the room (collecting my hoody from The Exmouth Arms on the way) for showers and for Roz to sort out what was happening with her credit card. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            We went out for the day at about 12:15. We had arranged to meet the others in The Doric Arch again and walked there via The Craft Beer Co. Clerkenwell where we had our first beer of the day. We met up with Steve, Neil, Sheila and Sheila's nephew in The Doric Arch and stayed with them until they headed off to Wembley. We were keen on keeping our day as similar as possible to the day of the Germany game so stayed in The Doric Arch until 4ish and then headed across to The Euston Tap. After a couple of excellent pints in there, we bought beer and sandwiches from Sainsbury's and headed once more for Euston Square.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            The tube journey to Wembley Park was quite lively. The capacity for tonight was up to 75%. The train was fuller than it had been for previous games and we were not the only ones that had been drinking all day. By about 6:15 we were sat at our usual bench on Wembley Way and spent about 40 minutes there getting through our beer. Again, getting into the ground was straightforward despite the higher attendance and we took our seats in the upper tier just after 7.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_013.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            We are not normally bothered about getting into the ground that early but we had had enough to drink by now and were happy to sit there as the atmosphere built up. We were joined just before kick-off by Steve and Mick who had also managed to pick up Jer as well. The game itself was probably as nerve-wracking as anything we have been through particularly when we went a goal down. It is hard to believe that we were only losing for 10 minutes - it seemed a lot longer. Once we had gone ahead, the time seemed to go surprisingly quickly but it was still a huge sense of relief as we got towards the final whistle and realised that we had made it into the final. The celebrations at the end were superb with most of the crowd remaining in the ground to sing along to Three Lions, Whole Again and Sweet Caroline. An unbelievable night...... and it means that we get to do it all again on Sunday.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            We said goodbye to the others as the celebrations were dying down and got the tube back to Kings Cross. There was not too much open by this time so we bought a bottle of wine and a couple of kebabs and returned to the room to continue our celebrations. It still did not seem real that we have made it to the final. Finally got to bed sometime after 1am.

            Both awake quite early despite the late night. We checked out of the hotel and walked back to the Greggs near Blackfriars. We bought breakfast and ate it by St Paul's before walking back to Waterloo. We were on a fast train back to Basingstoke at 10:20 and were back home again by about 11:30. I went out and did 18 miles on my bike in the afternoon but was too knackered to do a lot else.
