            A slightly  different start to a tournament as we were still at home. After being initially disappointed about the format of the tournament, and then the fact that England will play most of their games at Wembley, these two things have meant that we will at least get to some of the games in the next few weeks. 
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We have definitely got tickets for the three group games which were issued electronically as with the Nations League in Portugal, but do not know what will happen after that. We should have tickets for England's second round game if they win the group and it is played at Wembley, but not if they come second or third. It is unlikely that we will be able to travel to games other than in London but should be OK if they increase the capacity for the semi-final or final.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">However, we do not travel to London for England's first game until tomorrow so the first game was watched at home. Mark Vickery joined us for the game and we then went down to The Swan for a couple but it was a relatively early night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 12th June</span>
            We left the car in Basingstoke and were on the 10:30 train up to Waterloo. We arrived in London at 11:19 and were pleased to see that the station had been decorated in the Euro 2020 flags/logos, etc. It was starting to feel like a proper tournament!
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_001.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We left the station and started our walk along the river towards Tower Bridge where we are staying for the next couple of days. We stopped for a few drinks along the way. The first at Doggett's, then The Rake and finally The Pommelers Rest before getting to The Dean Swift where we had a table booked to watch Wales v Switzerland. This was an excellent pub, just down from the bridge, with very good beer and a reasonable range of tapas. We ate in here during the football and then walked across the river to check in to The Tower Hotel.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had paid a bit extra to get a room overlooking Tower Bridge and the view was excellent - certainly the best view we have ever had from any London hotel bedroom. We had an almost perfect view of Tower Bridge and The Shard and could also see plenty of bits of other landmarks. The room itself was also very nice although we could have done with the air-conditioning being a bit better. Roz went out to buy drinks and we had another beer in the room while half watching the Denmark v Finland game and half looking out of the window. The Christian Eriksen incident did briefly put a bit of a dampener on proceedings but he recovered consciousness and we headed out again for the rest of the evening.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            We headed back over the river and walked along the South bank. The pubs that were actually on the river such as the Horniman at Hays were quite busy with queues to get in so we went slightly inland. We had a couple in The Mudlark, two more in the Barrowboy and Banker and another two in our final pub for the day, The Hung Drawn and Quartered. We had a couple more drinks in the room while briefly joining the weekly video chat to end the night.
            </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 13th June - 14:00 England v Croatia</span>
            We left the hotel at 9:30 and walked to The Founders Arms where we had a table booked for breakfast with Steve. We ate there sat outside in the sun and had our first drinks of the day. Full English breakfast with Double Chocolate Stout. A good start to the day! Steve left after the first drink to meet Gavin. Roz and I stayed for a second and then walked to The Fire Station at Waterloo Station. We had one in there, bought a few cans and a sandwich from the Tesco over the road and then got the tube up to Wembley. By this time we were really starting to get excited about the football.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text"> 
            The tube journey to the ground was a lot easier due to the reduced capacity and we were at Wembley Park station by 12:30. We managed to find a bench to sit down at on Wembley Way and it was a surprisingly good spot to sit in the sun while we drank our cans. We had joked about "sitting on Wembley Way with cans" but this was an enjoyable half an hour sat looking at the ground and watching the crowd arriving. We started to walk towards the ground about an hour before kick-off. We had our covid-19 vaccination statuses checked and had no problems getting through the ticket checks with our electronic tickets.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_003.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">After buying a few things from the shop, we headed into the ground. With an attendance of only about 18,500 getting in through the turnstiles was a much less stressful experience than usual. We met up with Steve again along with Mick, Gary and eventually Sheila in the ground and still had time to have one more drink before taking our seats in the upper tier.  
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            It really did feel good to be back at a competitive football match again and the build up had been superb. The match itself, unlike some days out watching England, was as good as the build up with a good performance and excellent result. We stayed in the ground to applaud the players before heading back to Wembley Park station where Steve, Roz and I got the tube back to Waterloo. Again, a much easier experience with the reduced capacity.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks in The Hole in the Wall while watching Austria v North Macedonia. Steve then got the train home while Roz and I walked back to the hotel via a couple more pubs. A lot of the pubs in the area were closed but we had a drink in Doggett's again and then stopped for a couple at The Market Porter. We stopped for a pint at The Two Bridges Ale House to watch the end of The Netherlands v Ukraine match before walking back to the hotel. An excellent day!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 14th June</span>
            We left the hotel at 9:30 and walked to The Liberty Bounds at Tower Hill. We met up with some of Roz's friends (Claire and Alan) who had just arrived in London. We all had breakfast there before we walked back to Waterloo and caught the 12:05 train back to Basingstoke. We walked back to the car and were back in the house in time to watch Scotland losing their first game to Czech Republic.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We did not pay too much attention to the second game of the day - Poland v Slovakia - but just about managed to stay awake to watch the end of Sweden's 0 - 0 draw with Spain.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 15th June</span>
            Only two games today. We watched both at home - Portugal v Hungary at 17:00 and then the Germany v France game at 20:00.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 16th June</span>
            Watched the Wales v Turkey game at 17:00 and bits of the Russia v Finland game at 14:00 but missed the Italy v Switzerland game due to being at the Waterwitch with Aleks and Andi.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 16th June</span>
            Volunteered at the fire station for five hours in the morning then home for the days football. Did not watch much of the North Macedonia v Ukraine game but did see Denmark v Belgium and most of The Netherlands v Austria.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday, 18th June - 20:00 England v Scotland</span>
            After an early trip to the gym, we drove into Basingstoke, left the car behind the station and got a train into London at 11:15. After the glorious weather at the weekend, today was cold with heavy rain as we headed towards Clapham Junction. We arrived in Clapham Junction at about midday, walked around for a bit while Roz had a coffee and were in The Falcon by 12:15.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We had managed to book a range of different tables for various times and amounts of people but once inside were able to merge some, cancel others and extend one to give us a table for six until 6pm. Steve turned up with Jer and Mick at about 12:45 and Mark joined us at about 14:00. (Jer had taken Thomas' ticket as he was still stuck in Poland and Mark was the only one not going to the game)
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_004.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">It was an enjoyable afternoon. The beer range was not as good as it can be in The Falcon but it was good enough. We ate at 4ish and again, the food was very good. The whole thing was pretty good value as well as we had another voucher that gave us 25% off everything. We paid our bill just before 6pm (slightly too early in retrospect), said goodbye to Mark, who was staying in the area to watch the game, and got the 17:58 train to Willesden Junction. From there, it was three stops on the tube to Wembley Central. We walked to the ground and were through the turnstiles about an hour before kick-off. It was only Roz and I drinking by this stage so we had a couple more ciders on the concourse before going up to take our seats just before kick-off.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            Whereas on Sunday, the match was every bit as enjoyable as the build up, this one was terrible. Not quite as bad as the one in Cape Town in 2010 but it did bring back memories of that game. Very frustrating to be so defensive against a team like Scotland when we have so much attacking talent not being used. Left the ground feeling much the same as we did in Cape Town with the knowledge that we are not going much further in the competition if we continue to play like that!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">The journey home was uneventful - train to Willesden Junction, another to Clapham Junction and back in Basingstoke round about midnight.

            I drove to Basingstoke to collect my bike in the morning. We went out for a 25 mile ride at midday and spent the rest of the afternoon watching the football. Started drinking during the Germany v Portugal game and then joined the J-Team video call (Canada night)

            Hangover and slight cold. Did not do a lot all day. Only two games today and both played at the same time. Watched Italy v Wales at 17:00.

            Parked the car at Basingstoke station again and were on a train up to London by 11:15. We were in Waterloo by midday. We were booked into the Premier Inn at Blackfriars but could not check in until 2pm so started our pub crawl as soon as we left the station. We stopped for one in The Understudy, a craft beer bar attached to The National Gallery. From there, we crossed the river, walked along Fleet Street to The Hack and Hop, a pub we had not been to before.... and will probably not go to again as it is being demolished in September!
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_005.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
			We checked into the hotel (which was just round the corner from the pub) at 2, put our bags in the room and headed straight out to The Black Friar, one of our favourite pubs in London. After one in there, we walked round the corner for one in The Cockpit and then walked towards Smithfield Market stopping for another in The Viaduct Tavern. There were a few pubs in the Smithfield area that we had planned to go to but The Old Red Cow was closed and The Hand and Shears did not have a tele so we went instead into The Butcher's Hook and Cleaver, a large Fullers pub. We had a few in there while watching the Austria v Ukraine game and also shared a very good bar-b-q platter.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			We returned to The Hand and Shears for one when the game had finished. This was another very nice pub but we really should not have needed to sit by an open fire on the 21st June!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			Things are starting to get a bit vague now but we left The Hand and Shears and headed for The Farringdon Tap. I'm not sure why we were heading for this pub as it was not on the list but it turned out to be a very good choice. It was a nice craft beer pub with an excellent IPA from Northern Monk and a big tele for the Belgium v Finland game. I can not remember the finer points of this game but the result means that whatever happens tomorrow, England are into the second round.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
			We had a few pints during the game and I don't remember anything about leaving the pub or getting back to the hotel!
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 22nd June - 20:00 Czech Republic v England</span>
            We went out for breakfast at McDonalds at about 10 before returning to the room for showers. We headed out for the day at 12:15 and went first to The Jerusalem Tavern - another of our favourite pubs in London but one that does not open at weekends so we do not go there that often. Although we could happily have stayed in there a while, we just had one pint before walking to The Doric Arch at Euston Station where we had arranged to meet Steve and Sheila at 14:00. We were there just about on time and spent a few hours there during which time we were joined by Neil who we had met in Middlesbrough. 
            </p>                         
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/euro2020/euro2020_006.jpg"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We all stayed in the pub until 5ish when the others headed up to Wembley to meet more friends in "The Box Park". Roz and I did not really know what The Box Park was but it did not look like the sort of place we wanted to be in so we went to The Euston Tap for a couple more beers instead. We bought food and a couple of bottles from the Sainsbury's at Euston station and then got the Metropolitan Line up to Wembley Park. We then sat on Wembley Way at the same table we had been at nine days ago, ate our sandwiches and had a final beer before going into the  ground.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We met up with everyone again inside the ground and took our seats in the upper tier about 15 minutes before kick-off. Again, it was not the greatest of games but the 1 - 0 win means England have won their group without conceding a goal so we can not really complain. The win also means we will be back in Wembley in a weeks time for the second round game. Although this may not be that good news in terms of who we will be playing, it means we will have home advantage with a 45,000 crowd and it means that we get to go to at least one more match.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We left the ground almost straight away after the final whistle and got the train straight back to Farringdon. We bought more sandwiches and a bottle of wine and returned to the room to watch the highlights of the game on Match of the Day.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 23rd June</span>
            We had breakfast from Greggs and ate it on a bench by St Paul's Cathedral. We returned to the hotel collected our things and walked back to Waterloo via the Victoria Embankment. We made it to Waterloo just in time for the 10:05 train and were back in Basingstoke before 11:00.
            </p>                         
            <p class="diary-text">
            We both went out on our bikes for a couple of hours before the first game at 17:00. Very hard work after the amount of alcohol consumed  in the last few days! We watched the Spain v Slovakia game and then had an enjoyable evening watching the end of Group F... the results of which mean that we will be playing Germany next Tuesday at Wembley.

            Did not do a lot all day again. The weather was not great again so could not be bothered to go out on the bike. Spent most of the day lying on the settee waiting for the football to start at 17:00. Watched Czech Republic v The Netherlands and Belgium v Portugal. Both were reasonable games without being too exciting.

            Got to Basingstoke at round about the same time as usual but found there was a lot of disruption on the trains. We wanted to go into Victoria today, not Waterloo so had to get a slow train to Woking, change there for Clapham Junction and then get another train to Victoria. Finally got into Victoria at 1pm.

            We are staying the next two nights at The Copthorne in Kensington, about an hours walk from Victoria. We broke the walk up with a few Cask Marque pub stops. We started at The Duke of Wellington, a quite nice Shepherd Neame pub. The Admiral Codrington was closed and the Crown only had Doombar so next stop was The Anglesea Arms which was also OK. The Bolton was an excellent Dutch pub that was taking down its Euro 2020 flags as we arrived. They had an excellent range of Dutch beers so we had a couple in there before finishing the walk to the hotel.

			We checked into the hotel at about 4pm. Not quite as nice view as we had a couple of weeks ago but a nice enough room and very good value for London at £110 for two nights. We went out again almost straight away and continued our Cask Marque pub crawl. We had one in The Windsor Castle but they did not have a tele so we went to the Uxbridge Arms (a pub we have been in before) for the first half of the Croatia v Spain game. We moved to The Hillgate at half time and saw the end of the game and extra time in The Prince Albert. We moved to The Sun in Splendour for the France v Switzerland game and walked back to The Devonshire Arms (the closest pub to our hotel) for most of the second half and extra time/penalties.

            <p class="diary-text">It was an excellent day with some very good pubs and both the matches were superb to watch. There was a pretty good atmosphere in the Devonshire Arms, or about as good an atmosphere as you can get in a pub at the moment, with a few French fans and plenty of people supporting the Swiss. Unbelievable result at the end and the best team in the tournament are now out. Just need to beat the Germans now!!

            We had an excellent breakfast at the hotel (included with our room), had showers and headed out for the day at about 10:15. We had arranged to meet Steve in The Doric Arch again,
