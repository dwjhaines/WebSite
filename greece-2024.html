              An unusual start to this years trip to Greece. We were both due to fly out of Gatwick this afternoon but I have a PET scan booked for tomorrow in Guildford at 10:15. We decided that Roz should fly out as planned and I booked an EasyJet flight for tomorrow that should get me into Kos 24 hours after her if all goes to plan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I drove her to Gatwick and dropped her off in one of the car-parks. She was on the 15:10 BA flight to Kos and arrived on time just before 9pm local time. She got a taxi to Mastihari where we had booked an apartment for two nights. Our favourite restaurant from last year, Harama, was still open after she had checked into the hotel so she was able to go out for a meal and her first half litre of wine of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 12th September</span>
              My appointment in Guildford was at 10:15. I caught the 6:50 bus to Basingstoke and got straight onto a train to Woking. I had to wait about a minute for the connecting train and was at Guildford station by 7:45. The connections could not possibly have gone any better so with plenty of time to spare, I walked to the Alliance Medical PET-CT centre about two miles away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Despite my appointment not being until 10:15, I went and checked in at 8:45. I was expecting to have to wait around for an hour or so but a nurse came and got me before 9 and I was taken away to have some sort of radio-active liquid pumped into me. I then had a wait of about an hour for the PET scan. This took a bit longer than a CT scan but was not as bad as the MRI scan. Anyway, by about 10:45, it was all over and I was told I could go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I had not expected to get out until 12:15 and had planned to get an Uber to Gatwick. However, getting out at this time meant that I could walk back to the station and get the train. I was at the station with plenty of time to get the 11:36 train which departed on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I arrived at Gatwick at 12:25 and made by way via the shuttle train to North Terminal. Security was surprisingly quick and I was in the departure area before 1 - plenty of time for my 15:10 EasyJet flight. The departure area was horrendous with long queues for everything and a poor selection of beers in the Wetherspoons. After eating a sandwich for lunch, I found the Brewdog bar which was relatively quiet and had a pint in there before heading to the gate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Everyone boarded on time but we then sat at the gate for over an hour before leaving. Apparently there was bad weather in the area and all departures were suspended for 30 minutes or so. We eventually took off at about 4:40. I had been really happy with the way everything had gone today but this was a bit of a frustrating wait! The flight was uneventful. I managed to avoid the alcohol for most of the flight but did have a couple of bottles of red wine as we approached Kos.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We landed in Kos at about 22:20. Getting through the airport was fairly quick. We had to go by bus to the terminal but I was one of the first off and got straight into the front at immigration. I was probably the first person from the flight to get through so I was able to get straight into a taxi. The taxi took me straight to Harama Restaurant where I had arranged to meet Roz. It was great to finally get there after the last couple of days and we had a very enjoyable meal before walking to the hotel (Angela Thalia Apartments) which was just round the corner. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 13th September</span>
              We were up by 7 and got a taxi to the ferry terminal in Kos town. We ate breakfast while waiting for the ticket office to open and eventually boarded the 9:00 SAOS ferry to Tilos. The September schedule for this ferry had only been announced a couple of weeks ago so it was almost totally empty. It was very comfortable journey and we arrived in Tilos about 15 minutes late, just after midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked an apartment at Blue Sky Apartments which could not have been much closer to the ferry port. Hoggy and Sarah were already there when we arrived and are staying in the apartment next to ours. After teas and coffees in their apartment, we returned to ours, unpacked and went out to look around the village. Our favourite restaurant from last time is "closed for the season" for some reason but things had not changed too much.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We bought provisions and returned to the apartment to have lunch on the balcony which overlooks the harbour. We rejoined Hoggy and Sarah on the beach and spent an hour or so in the sun. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After returning to the apartments, we started drinking at 7. It was a typical Greece J-Team session. We started with a few drinks and nibbles on Hoggy and Sarah's balcony. At 8:30ish, we walked along the sea front to Filoxenia Restaurant. We got through three litres of wine with our meals and then walked back to the bar in the centre of the village. We had a few bottles of retsina in there (including a couple of bottles of particularly nasty ros√© retsina) and got back to the apartments just after midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 14th September</span>
              Did not do anything all morning. We went down for breakfast at 9ish and then returned to the air-conditioning to sleep off the effects of too much wine last night. We had lunch on the balcony and had just about fully recovered by 2pm. Roz went to the beach and I repeated the walk I did a couple of times in 2018 to the abandoned village of Gera. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I got back to the beach by 4:45. Just enough time for a quick dip to cool off before returning to the apartment for the afternoons football. The Wi-Fi here is quite good so we were both able to watch our games at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Once the football had finished, it was time to start on the wine again. We had a very similar night to yesterday apart from the fact that we started on our balcony this time. We had reserved a table at Filoxenia for 9pm. We got through three litres of wine again with our meals and then returned to the bar.
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 15th September</span>
              We were up to doing things slightly earlier today. Roz went to the beach just after 11 and I went for my walk. I headed inland this time and started walking along the road towards the "elephant museum". After a mile or so of walking on the road, I saw a path heading to Mikro Chorio so took that instead. Mikro Chorio was another abandoned settlement although a couple of the buildings did look as if they were still in use. I walked back down to the beach by 1pm.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had our first cheese pie of the trip for lunch and returned to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon. Another session in the evening. Filoxenia was either closed or full (not sure which but we had been unable to reserve a table) so we ate at The Grill House, a few doors down from it. Still got through the usual three litres of wine followed by a couple of retsinas in the square.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Monday 16th September</span>
              After breakfast, we bought tickets for tomorrows ferry to Leros and finally sorted out my Dodekanisos bonus card. I repeated my walk to Gera and got back to the apartment by about 2pm. Roz was struggling again worrying about my cancer and stayed in the apartment. We are still waiting for the results of my scan and it is difficult to think about much else at the moment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had leftovers from last nights meal for lunch on the balcony and joined Hoggy and Sarah at the beach for an hour or so after eating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had slightly less to drink tonight as we are leaving Tilos tomorrow. We still had a few drinks on our balcony before going out but just had the two litres of wine with our meal. We had very good food at at Gorgona Restaurant and a final few bottles of retsina at the bar in the square.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 17th September</span>
              Due to the slightly earlier night, we were up in time to see the sun rise from our balcony. We had breakfast and then waited in the room for the Dodekanisos Express to appear. As soon as we saw the ferry on the horizon, we picked up our bags and walked downstairs. The ferry left just about on time at 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The journey to Leros took just over three hours. Roz and I sat in the airline seats downstairs, Hoggy and Sarah were upstairs as they wanted to sit outside. We arrived at 13:05 and despite the large number of people getting off, were able to get straight in a taxi for the one mile drive to Tony's Beach Resort. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we left our bags in Hoggy and Sarah's room and walked straight to the supermarket for provisions for the next couple of days. By the time we got back, our room was ready and we were able to move in and unpack. We are in room 125, a room that we have stayed in before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After eating lunch on the balcony, we went down to the beach. It was very nice to be lying on sun loungers after the stones at Tilos! While at the beach, I had a phone call from a cancer nurse in Basingstoke to tell me that my cancer has not spread to other parts of my body and that I will now be referred to Southampton for surgery. It has spread to one of my lymph nodes which will have to be removed as well but overall, this was very good news. I walked up to Dimitris to reserve a table for tonight but did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Evening drinks were on Hoggy and Sarah's balcony. We walked up the hill to Dimitris at 8:45 and had an excellent meal here again. The food seemed even better than on previous trips and certainly a step up from most of the food on Tilos. We got through seven bottles of retsina before staggering back down the hill again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 18th September</span>
              Roz and I walked to Lakki for breakfast at Mike's bakery and bought a couple of things from the supermarket on the way back. We had a couple of hours on the beach before lunch on the balcony and then another couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had drinks on our balcony before going up to Dimitris. The retsina must have been stronger tonight as neither me, Roz or Hoggy could remember walking back down the hill despite having a bottle less than last night. (Sarah has not been drinking as much as the rest of us as she has gout in her elbows)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 19th September</span>
              After breakfast on the balcony, I walked to round Lakki to do my steps for the day, bought a few things from the supermarket and walked back to the join the others by the beach. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After lunch on the balcony, I phoned the prostate cancer people in Basingstoke again. We had both been struggling with everything since Tuesday and were considering options for flying straight home. However, I managed to get through to Precious again, the nurse I had spoken to when we were in Ireland a couple of weeks ago. Once again, she was very reassuring and answered all our questions. She seemed to think we should hear from Southampton within the next week and we decided to carry on with the holiday as planned.
            </p>

              After the phone call, it was back to the pool for the rest of the afternoon. The evening was just about the same as the previous two. The food at Dimitris was superb again. We had just about finished our sixth bottle of retsina when we were given two more on the house meaning that we don't remember walking back for the second night in a row.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 20th September</span>
              We were up by about 9:30. After breakfast on the  balcony, I walked to the end of Pantelli and back. As I was getting back to Tony's, Hoggy and Sarah were leaving. They go to Lipsi today. We will rejoin them when we go there tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              It was another quiet day of not doing much. We had a couple of hours on the beach before lunch on the balcony and another trip to the supermarket..... and then returned to the beach for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked a table for 8 instead of 9 at Dimitris as we were in need of an earlier more sober night. We had just the one bottle of retsina with our meals and were back in the room just after 9.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 21st September</span>
              Due to the early night yesterday, we were able to get up for the sun-rise. We were both on the beach by 6:45 and stayed taking photos for half an hour or so. Roz then went for a swim while I walked to Mike's in Lakki to buy breakfast.

              We were both back in the room by 9 and had breakfast on the balcony. We checked out of Tony's at 10:30 and walked to Agia Marina. We were there by 11:15 so had an hour to wait for the 12:15 ferry to Liros. We bought tickets and pies for lunch and the ferry turned up just about on time. By 12:45, we were in Lipsi.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The Poseidon Hotel had cancelled our reservation a couple of weeks ago due to being "double booked". This was pretty poor as we had paid for the room back in February. We had rejected the alternative accommodation they had offered us (the place Regan stayed last year) and booked a studio apartment at Calypso Hotel. This was only a five minute walk from the ferry port and was a much nicer room than we had at Rena's last year. The room itself is better and it has a balcony with good views of the main town here and the harbour. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went down to say hello to Hoggy and Sarah who we saw as they were coming back from the beach and then had our lunch on the balcony. We then walked straight to the Liento√∫ Beach, the one at the back of Rena's. It was quite windy when we got there and not that pleasant for sunbathing. We stayed on the beach for about 30 minutes, then went for a 1km swim before returning to the apartment for the afternoons football. Sunderland were the 12:30 kick-off at home (14:30 here) and we were back in the room to watch the end of the first half.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Once the afternoon football had finished, we took our wine and walked over to Rena's to join Hoggy, Sarah, Regan, Annette and the jiblets on the balcony. Within about ten minutes, Ewan was having a tantrum very reminiscent of the one he had here almost exactly a year ago. Once again, he had to be taken back to their apartment by Annette. The rest of us proceeded to the ouzery and then to Manoli's by which time Regan had gone back to be replaced by Annette.

              After the meal and another three litres of wine, Roz, Hoggy and myself were joined by Regan back in the ouzery although things are getting a bit vague by this time! We had a final drink on our balcony and got to bed sometime after 1am.

              A slightly later start to the day today. Roz went out to buy bread and we had breakfast on the balcony. She went off to the beach at 11ish and I went out for walk of about five or six miles mainly along the top of the hill that runs along the middle of the island. We met back in the room and had lunch on the balcony again.

              It is quite windy at the moment and we had considered walking to Chochlako√πra Beach which is more sheltered than Liento√∫. However, at 3 neither of us could be bothered to walk over there so we went back to the same spot as yesterday for an hour or so.

              The evening was very similar to yesterday. We had drinks at Regan and Annette's balcony this time and it was Regan's turn to come to Manoli's with us. It was about the same amount of alcohol and about the same end to the evening.

              An almost identical day to yesterday. Breakfast on the balcony, a five mile walk while Roz was on the beach, lunch on the balcony and a return to the  beach in the afternoon. The wind had dropped a bit today so the beach was more comfortable to lie on.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had a bit of a change this evening as we ate at Pefko Restaurant instead of Manoli's. This was the first time Roz and I had eaten anywhere else on Lipsi. Apart from that, everything was the same as usual. It was Annette's turn to eat out with us and it was the normal routine of drinks on the balcony, an hour in the ouzery and too much wine with the meal.

              Roz was feeling a bit down again today. Instead of going to the beach in the morning, she came with me on my walk. When we got back, I had a phone call from the hospital in Southampton offering me an appointment tomorrow as they had a cancellation. It was not possible for us to get home in time for this so I had to turn it down. This was very frustrating as there was nothing we could do about it. I was told that I would get my appointment date later today.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went to the beach after lunch and when I got back, I received an e-mail offering me an appointment on 23rd of October. This was not good as we were hoping to see someone sooner than that. When Roz got back from the beach, we booked a consultation privately on October 1st. This will mean that we only have three nights in Alinda and we will have to book new flights home for Sunday but we are both keen to get things sorted out as soon as possible.

              The evening was the same as the previous ones here. We started on the wine at Regan and Annette's apartment, had an hour at the ouzery before eating at Manoli's. The stress of the hospital appointment seemed to cause the wine to go down quicker than usual resulting in not being able to remember much about the latter stages of the evening. I just about remember that the ouzery was closed after we had eaten so our final drinks were in the restaurant in front of the hotel.

              After chocolate croissants on the balcony for breakfast, we checked out of the hotel just after 11. We had ice-creams from the bakery while we waited for the 12:45 ferry back to Leros. We met up with the others at the port and were on the same boat as them although they were staying on it all the way to Kos. Regan, Annette and the jiblets have another few days there and Hoggy and Sarah are flying home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We said our good-byes to everyone and got off the boat when it arrived at Leros at 14:00. We came into Agia Marina and walked to Eleona's. Dimitri was not there when we arrived but one of the guests in the room next door told us to let ourselves into our room. It was good to be back - everything was exactly the same as it has been on previous years. Dimitri did eventually turn up and we explained that we would just be here for three nights, not the seven we had booked.

              After we had eaten lunch on the terrace, we unpacked and went over the road to the beach for an hour or so. When I got back, I had a couple of phone calls from the secretary of the doctor I will see next week as she wanted more information for him to look at before the consultation.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were desperately in need of a quiet, sober night after the last couple of weeks. We still went out and ate at To Steki but just had one half litre jug of wine and were back in the room by 9.

              We woke up feeling a bit healthier than we have done the last few mornings. We had breakfast on the terrace and, at about 9:30, I went out for a walk. I had not made it up to the castle when we stayed at Tony's so headed over to Agia Marina and up the hill to join the steps. I went into the castle then down past the windmills before finding a road I had not been on before which bought me back into the centre of Platanos. From there I went back down to Agia Marina and back along the sea front to Alinda.

              I stopped at a supermarket for water and got back to Eleona's by about midday. Roz spent most of the morning on the beach and came back at 1ish for lunch. It was then back to the beach for the rest of the afternoon.

              We were back on the wine tonight. We started on the balcony with a bottle that was in the fridge when we arrived and we also got half way through our complimentary raki.

              We ate at To Steki as usual but were in the main restaurant tonight instead of on the beach. We got through a couple of litres of wine with the meal which was all quite entertaining due to group of about 25 people from Turkey who were celebrating someone's birthday. We were given more free drinks when we went to pay the bill (ouzo) and ended the evening with more wine on the balcony.
