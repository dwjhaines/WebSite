              An unusual start to this years trip to Greece. We were both due to fly out of Gatwick this afternoon but I have a PET scan booked for tomorrow in Guildford at 10:15. We decided that Roz should fly out as planned and I booked an EasyJet flight for tomorrow that should get me into Kos 24 hours after her if all goes to plan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I drove her to Gatwick and dropped her off in one of the car-parks. She was on the 15:10 BA flight to Kos and arrived on time just before 9pm local time. She got a taxi to Mastihari where we had booked an apartment for two nights. Our favourite restaurant from last year, Harama, was still open after she had checked into the hotel so she was able to go out for a meal and her first half litre of wine of the trip.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 12th September</span>
              My appointment in Guildford was at 10:15. I caught the 6:50 bus to Basingstoke and got straight onto a train to Woking. I had to wait about a minute for the connecting train and was at Guildford station by 7:45. The connections could not possibly have gone any better so with plenty of time to spare, I walked to the Alliance Medical PET-CT centre about two miles away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Despite my appointment not being until 10:15, I went and checked in at 8:45. I was expecting to have to wait around for an hour or so but a nurse came and got me before 9 and I was taken away to have some sort of radio-active liquid pumped into me. I then had a wait of about an hour for the PET scan. This took a bit longer than a CT scan but was not as bad as the MRI scan. Anyway, by about 10:45, it was all over and I was told I could go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I had not expected to get out until 12:15 and had planned to get an Uber to Gatwick. However, getting out at this time meant that I could walk back to the station and get the train. I was at the station with plenty of time to get the 11:36 train which departed on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I arrived at Gatwick at 12:25 and made by way via the shuttle train to North Terminal. Security was surprisingly quick and I was in the departure area before 1 - plenty of time for my 15:10 EasyJet flight. The departure area was horrendous with long queues for everything and a poor selection of beers in the Wetherspoons. After eating a sandwich for lunch, I found the Brewdog bar which was relatively quiet and had a pint in there before heading to the gate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Everyone boarded on time but we then sat at the gate for over an hour before leaving. Apparently there was bad weather in the area and all departures were suspended for 30 minutes or so. We eventually took off at about 4:40. I had been really happy with the way everything had gone today but this was a bit of a frustrating wait! The flight was uneventful. I managed to avoid the alcohol for most of the flight but did have a couple of bottles of red wine as we approached Kos.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We landed in Kos at about 22:20. Getting through the airport was fairly quick. We had to go by bus to the terminal but I was one of the first off and got straight into the front at immigration. I was probably the first person from the flight to get through so I was able to get straight into a taxi. The taxi took me straight to Harama Restaurant where I had arranged to meet Roz. It was great to finally get there after the last couple of days and we had a very enjoyable meal before walking to the hotel (Angela Thalia Apartments) which was just round the corner. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 13th September</span>
              We were up by 7 and got a taxi to the ferry terminal in Kos town. We ate breakfast while waiting for the ticket office to open and eventually boarded the 9:00 SAOS ferry to Tilos. The September schedule for this ferry had only been announced a couple of weeks ago so it was almost totally empty. It was very comfortable journey and we arrived in Tilos about 15 minutes late, just after midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked an apartment at Blue Sky Apartments which could not have been much closer to the ferry port. Hoggy and Sarah were already there when we arrived and are staying in the apartment next to ours. After teas and coffees in their apartment, we returned to ours, unpacked and went out to look around the village. Our favourite restaurant from last time is "closed for the season" for some reason but things had not changed too much.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We bought provisions and returned to the apartment to have lunch on the balcony which overlooks the harbour. We rejoined Hoggy and Sarah on the beach and spent an hour or so in the sun. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After returning to the apartments, we started drinking at 7. It was a typical Greece J-Team session. We started with a few drinks and nibbles on Hoggy and Sarah's balcony. At 8:30ish, we walked along the sea front to Filoxenia Restaurant. We got through three litres of wine with our meals and then walked back to the bar in the centre of the village. We had a few bottles of retsina in there (including a couple of bottles of particularly nasty ros√© retsina) and got back to the apartments just after midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 14th September</span>
              Did not do anything all morning. We went down for breakfast at 9ish and then returned to the air-conditioning to sleep off the effects of too much wine last night. We had lunch on the balcony and had just about fully recovered by 2pm. Roz went to the beach and I repeated the walk I did a couple of times in 2018 to the abandoned village of Gera. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I got back to the beach by 4:45. Just enough time for a quick dip to cool off before returning to the apartment for the afternoons football. The Wi-Fi here is quite good so we were both able to watch our games at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Once the football had finished, it was time to start on the wine again. We had a very similar night to yesterday apart from the fact that we started on our balcony this time. We had reserved a table at Filoxenia for 9pm. We got through three litres of wine again with our meals and then returned to the bar.
            </p>

              <span class="diary-date">Sunday 15th September</span>
              We were up to doing things slightly earlier today. Roz went to the beach just after 11 and I went for my walk. I headed inland this time and started walking along the road towards the "elephant museum". After a mile or so of walking on the road, I saw a path heading to Mikro Chorio so took that instead. Mikro Chorio was another abandoned settlement although a couple of the buildings did look as if they were still in use. I walked back down to the beach by 1pm.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had our first cheese pie of the trip for lunch and returned to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon. Another session in the evening. Filoxenia was either closed or full (not sure which but we had been unable to reserve a table) so we ate at The Grill House, a few doors down from it. Still got through the usual three litres of wine followed by a couple of retsinas in the square.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Monday 16th September</span>
              After breakfast, we bought tickets for tomorrows ferry to Leros and finally sorted out my Dodekanisos bonus card. I repeated my walk to Gera and got back to the apartment by about 2pm. Roz was struggling again worrying about my cancer and stayed in the apartment. We are still waiting for the results of my scan and it is difficult to think about much else at the moment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had leftovers from last nights meal for lunch on the balcony and joined Hoggy and Sarah at the beach for an hour or so after eating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had slightly less to drink tonight as we are leaving Tilos tomorrow. We still had a few drinks on our balcony before going out but just had the two litres of wine with our meal. We had very good food at at Gorgona Restaurant and a final few bottles of retsina at the bar in the square.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 17th September</span>
              Due to the slightly earlier night, we were up in time to see the sun rise from our balcony. We had breakfast and then waited in the room for the Dodekanisos Express to appear. As soon as we saw the ferry on the horizon, we picked up our bags and walked downstairs. The ferry left just about on time at 10:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The journey to Leros took just over three hours. Roz and I sat in the airline seats downstairs, Hoggy and Sarah were upstairs as they wanted to sit outside. We arrived at 13:05 and despite the large number of people getting off, were able to get straight in a taxi for the one mile drive to Tony's Beach Resort. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we left our bags in Hoggy and Sarah's room and walked straight to the supermarket for provisions for the next couple of days. By the time we got back, our room was ready and we were able to move in and unpack. We are in room 125, a room that we have stayed in before.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After eating lunch on the balcony, we went down to the beach. It was very nice to be lying on sun loungers after the stones at Tilos! While at the beach, I had a phone call from a cancer nurse in Basingstoke to tell me that my cancer has not spread to other parts of my body and that I will now be referred to Southampton for surgery. It has spread to one of my lymph nodes which will have to be removed as well but overall, this was very good news. I walked up to Dimitri's to reserve a table for tonight but did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Evening drinks were on Hoggy and Sarah's balcony. We walked up the hill to Dimitri's at 8:45 and had an excellent meal here again. The food seemed even better than on previous trips and certainly a step up from most of the food on Tilos. We got through seven bottles of retsina before staggering back down the hill again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 18th September</span>
              Roz and I walked to Lakki for breakfast at Mike's bakery and bought a couple of things from the supermarket on the way back. We had a couple of hours on the beach before lunch on the balcony and then another couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had drinks on our balcony before going up to Dimitri's. The retsina must have been stronger tonight as me, Roz or Hoggy could remember walking back down the hill despite having a bottle less than last night. (Sarah has not been drinking as much as the rest of us as she has gout in her elbows)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 19th September</span>
              After breakfast on the balcony, I walked to round Lakki to do my steps for the day, bought a few things from the supermarket and walked back to the join the others by the beach. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After lunch on the balcony, I phoned the prostate cancer people in Basingstoke again. We had both been struggling with everything since Tuesday and were considering options for flying straight home. However, I managed to get through to Precious again, the nurse I had spoken to when we were in Ireland a couple of weeks ago. Once again, she was very reassuring and answered all our questions. She seemed to think we should hear from Southampton within the next week and we decided to carry on with the holiday as planned.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After the phone call, it was back to the pool for the rest of the afternoon. The evening was just about the same as the previous two. The food at Dimitri's was superb again. We had just about finished our six bottles of retsina when we were given two more meaning that we don't remember walking back for the second night in a row.
