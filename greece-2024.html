              An unusual start to this years trip to Greece. We were both due to fly out of Gatwick this afternoon but I have a PET scan booked for tomorrow in Guildford at 10:15. We decided that Roz should fly out as planned and I booked an EasyJet flight for tomorrow that should get me into Kos 24 hours after her if all goes to plan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I drove her to Gatwick and dropped her off in one of the car-parks. She was on the 15:10 BA flight to Kos and arrived on time just before 9pm local time. She got a taxi to Mastihari where we had booked an apartment for two nights. Our favourite restaurant from last year, Harama, was still open after she had checked into the hotel so she was able to go out for a meal and her first half litre of wine of the trip.

              My appointment in Guildford was at 10:15. I caught the 6:50 bus to Basingstoke and got straight onto a train to Woking. I had to wait about a minute for the connecting train and was at Guildford station by 7:45. The connections could not possibly have gone any better so with plenty of time to spare, I walked to the Alliance Medical PET-CT centre about two miles away.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Despite my appointment not being until 10:15, I went and checked in at 8:45. I was expecting to have to wait around for an hour or so but a nurse came and got me before 9 and I was taken away to have some sort of radio-active liquid pumped into me. I then had a wait of about an hour for the PET scan. This took a bit longer than a CT scan but was not as bad as the MRI scan. Anyway, by about 10:45, it was all over and I was told I could go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I had not expected to get out until 12:15 and had planned to get an Uber to Gatwick. However, getting out at this time meant that I could walk back to the station and get the train. I was at the station with plenty of time to get the 11:36 train which departed on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I arrived at Gatwick at 12:25 and made by way via the shuttle train to North Terminal. Security was surprisingly quick and I was in the departure area before 1 - plenty of time for my 15:10 EasyJet flight. The departure area was horrendous with long queues for everything and a poor selection of beers in the Wetherspoons. After eating a sandwich for lunch, I found the Brewdog bar which was relatively quiet and had a pint in there before heading to the gate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Everyone boarded on time but we then sat at the gate for over an hour before leaving. Apparently there was bad weather in the area and all departures were suspended for 30 minutes or so. We eventually took off at about 4:40. I had been really happy with the way everything had gone today but this was a bit of a frustrating wait! The flight was uneventful. I managed to avoid the alcohol for most of the flight but did have a couple of bottles of red wine as we approached Kos.

              We landed in Kos at about 22:20. Getting through the airport was fairly quick. We had to go by bus to the terminal but I was one of the first off and got straight into the front at immigration. I was probably the first person from the flight to get through so I was able to get straight into a taxi. The taxi took me straight to Harama Restaurant where I had arranged to meet Roz. It was great to finally get there after the last couple of days and we had a very enjoyable meal before walking to the hotel (Angela Thalia Apartments) which was just round the corner. We had a couple of drinks on the balcony before bed.

              <span class="diary-date">Friday 13th September</span>
              We were up by 7 and got a taxi to the ferry terminal in Kos town. We ate breakfast while waiting for the ticket office to open and eventually boarded the 9:00 SAOS ferry to Tilos. The September schedule for this ferry had only been announced a couple of weeks ago so it was almost totally empty. It was very comfortable journey and we arrived in Tilos about 15 minutes late, just after midday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked an apartment at Blue Sky Apartments which could not have been much closer to the ferry port. Hoggy and Sarah were already there when we arrived and are staying in the apartment next to ours. After teas and coffees in their apartment, we returned to ours, unpacked and went out to look around the village. Our favourite restaurant from last time is "closed for the season" for some reason but things had not changed too much.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We bought provisions and returned to the apartment to have lunch on the balcony which overlooks the harbour. We rejoined Hoggy and Sarah on the beach and spent an hour or so in the sun. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After returning to the apartments, we started drinking at 7. It was a typical Greece J-Team session. We started with a few drinks and nibbles on Hoggy and Sarah's balcony. At 8:30ish, we walked along the sea front to Filoxenia Restaurant. We got through three litres of wine with our meals and then walked back to the bar in the centre of the village. We had a few bottles of retsina in there (including a couple of bottles of particularly nasty ros√© retsina) and got back to the apartments just after midnight.

              <span class="diary-date">Saturday 14th September</span>
              Did not do anything all morning. We went down for breakfast at 9ish and then returned to the air-conditioning to sleep off the effects of too much wine last night. We had lunch on the balcony and had just about fully recovered by 2pm. Roz went to the beach and I repeated the walk I did a couple of times in 2018 to the abandoned village of Gera. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I got back to the beach by 4:45. Just enough time for a quick dip to cool off before returning to the apartment for the afternoons football.
