		Day 2006</font> </b>
		We were up by 7 and opened a couple of presents each (new camera!) 
		before heading off for another days diving. We were picked up late, 
		probably due 
		to Lanta Diver's Christmas party last night, but were still on the boat 
		and on our way by 8:30. We had chosen to dive with Regan and Annette and 
		after a few problems getting down initially had two dives of around 36 
		minutes each. The 
		dives - both at Koh Ha - were not wonderful as the visibility was far 
		worse than we had seen on previous days but it worked out reasonably 
		well that they got sorted out before starting their advanced course on 
		Wednesday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at Kaw Kwang by 4:30 and after showers and a couple of 
		phone calls home, opened the rest of our presents. We also started 
		drinking and were joined on our balcony by Regan and Annette just after 
		6. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0251.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">We had a couple of plates of spring rolls and fish cakes while having 
		a few more beers and headed off to our usual restaurant on the beach 
		sometime after 8. We had decided on Thai food instead of a more 
		traditional meal and had another very good meal. We stayed in the 
		restaurant until it closed and moved to the bar next door. By this time 
		we were already pretty pissed due to the amount of Sang Som that we had 
		consumed. We stayed there until about 3ish before 
		staggering home. 
		Don't really remember too much about the latter stages of the evening 
		but it had been a very good way of spending Christmas!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Boxing Day</b></font><b><font size="4">
		2006</font> </b>Had the worst hangover since 
		getting to Thailand. We overslept and missed breakfast, which probably 
		did not help, and did not get up until lunchtime. I had also managed to 
		inflict more damage on the foot that I had injured last week. The 
		original injury has not healed and staggering around with no shoes on 
		seems to have made it quite a bit worse. I finally made it to the pool 
		just after 3 but did not really recover until after my shower at 5ish. 
		We were joined by Regan and Annette for tea at Kaw Kwang and were back 
		in our room by 8:30. We watched Chelsea v Reading on our tele and then 
		slept while receiving text messages from Steve and Cathy about Sunderland and 
		Swansea (who both won!). Finally got to sleep properly at midnight.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Two dives at Koh Bida. We were not on the same boat as Regan and Annette 
		as they were doing the first day of their Advanced Diving course. The 
		dive sites were pretty spectacular again but the visibility was still 
		not good. 
		After the second dive, Anjali, who is a physiotherapist, decided that my 
		toe might be dislocated and she tried to pull it back into place. This 
		was quite painful and did not achieve a lot. An Indian/Malaysian doctor 
		who happened to be on the boat was happy to have a look at it and 
		confirmed that the toe was broken. He advised going to a clinic 
		of some sort to get it properly taped up. We got back to Saladan, bought 
		a roll of surgical tape for 40 baht and did it ourselves. How effective 
		this will be, I do not know but it should be OK to keep diving for a few 
		more days. If it is still bad when we leave Lanta I can sort it out in 
		Phuket.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked to the German restaurant on the beach for our evening meal and 
		were back in our room not long after 9.</p>

		We finally made it to Hin Muang and Hin Daeng today. It was about a 3<font face="Times New Roman">½ 
		hour journey to the sites and we were on the same boat as </font>Regan 
		and Annette as they continued their course. The dives were both 
		excellent and it was worth the wait. There was still poor visibility in 
		places and strong currents caused by thermo-clines but these were by far 
		the best dives we have done since getting to Thailand. Highlights 
		included a large school of batfish and a school of some of the biggest 
		barracuda we have ever seen.</p>

		Ate at Kaw Kwang. Foot slightly better!</p>

		Friday, 29th December 2006</font> </b>
		We returned to Koh Bida for another two dives. These were better dives 
		than two days ago despite the visibility not being much better. We dived 
		from Lanta Diver's smaller boat, Macha Nou. We were on our own with Anjali again 
		after her day off yesterday and were on the same boat as Regan and 
		Annette who were completing their Advanced course.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0279.JPG" width="264" height="198" align="right">There 
		was plenty to see on both dives including an octopus, our first leopard 
		shark of the trip and another turtle. The others had one or two problems 
		with their dives but by the end of the day had completed their course. 
		It was a relatively early day compared to yesterday and we were back at 
		Kaw Kwang by about 4:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Another day off diving tomorrow meaning that we could all get drunk 
		again tonight. We left Kaw Kwang just before 6 and stopped for a beer 
		with the Belgium couple we had met a couple of days ago. We left their 
		resort about an hour later and walked down to Summer House. We had a 
		couple more beers on Regan's balcony and then returned to Sunset 
		restaurant for the usual selection of curries and Sang Som. We moved to 
		the bar when the restaurant closed and walked back from there sometime 
		around 1am. I tried not to drink as much as normal to avoid doing more 
		damage to my foot and a repeat of the hangover of Boxing Day. Drinking 
		at the same speed as Regan seemed to achieve this although a few 
		sub-rounds were required to avoid complete soberness! I just about 
		remember walking back although Roz remembers nothing from when we moved 
		to the bar.</p>

		30th December 2006</font> </b>A bit less Sang Som last night seemed to 
		make a big difference to the hangover. We made it to breakfast and I was 
		able to make it to the pool by about 11. We walked into Saladan for 
		lunch at Lanta Seafood and called into Lanta Diver mainly to find out 
		about their schedule for the end of January. I got my haircut while Roz 
		looked at the internet and we walked back to Kaw Kwang for another hour 
		by the pool.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were joined at Kaw Kwang by Regan and Annette at about 6:30. We ate 
		in the restaurant and then spent an hour or so playing Perudo on our 
		balcony. After they had left, we watched Spurs v Liverpool in our room 
		while listening to World Service. (Huddersfield 3, Swansea 2)</p>

		31st December 2006</font> </b>Our last days diving for this visit to 
		Lanta. We dived Koh Bida Nok and Hin Bida from Macha Nou again but this 
		time had Regan and Annette in our group. Apart from a few problems with 
		Regan's ear, the dives were without any major incidents. The vis was 
		still poor but they were still both enjoyable dives with the leopard 
		sharks on the second being the highlight. We only had a short surface 
		interval to ensure that we could get back to Saladan early and we were 
		back at the dive centre by 3. We bought Anjali a beer and had our first 
		of the day before getting our lift back to Kaw Kwang.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had another beer on our balcony before walking down to meet the 
		others at Summer House for 
		6:30. We had a few more beers on their balcony before going out to eat at 
		Sunset Restaurant.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2430.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">The 
		restaurant was packed when we arrived and we only just got a table on 
		the beach. This meant that we did not end up eating until fairly late 
		and were already quite pissed by the time the food came. It was a pretty 
		good atmosphere on the beach with plenty of fireworks and big balloons being released. We were still in the restaurant at midnight 
		which I just about remember but I can not recall much after we moved to 
		the bar next door. Apparently, me and Roz left sometime after 2, leaving 
		Annette to try and wake up Regan.</p>
