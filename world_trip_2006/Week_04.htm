		Checked out of the hotel by about 10 and had an uneventful 4 hour drive 
		up<font face="Times New Roman"> to Münster where we had booked four 
		nights in another Ibis. We had found Münster due to it having a brewery 
		that produces two of the beers in my 300 Beers book and it is also 
		convenient for Gelsenkirchen, the venue of England's quarter final 
		against Portugal.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We wandered round the 
		sights of the old town for an hour or so and found out where we would be 
		able to hire bikes for tomorrow. In the evening we went out to the 
		Pinkus Müller Brewery for a couple of drinks and had a kebab before a 
		relatively early night (the first day since June 9th with no football)</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 23 - 29th June 2006</font> </b>
		As well as the beer, <font face="Times New Roman"> Münster was a good 
		place to come due to the number of cycle paths in the area which is 
		famous for its castles and palaces. We hired bikes at the train station 
		and headed off on what turned out to be a 55 mile trip. There were 
		disappointingly few castles on the trip but the one that we did get to, 
		Schloss Nordkirchen, was quite impressive and worth the trip. We got 
		back into Münster at about 5:30, went out for a few drinks and another 
		relatively quiet night.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 24 - 
		30th June 2006</font> </b>We had planned to do another days cycling but 
		had gone further than expected yesterday so decided to have a day off 
		today. Also, Mark had decided to join us in <font face="Times New Roman"> 
		Münster and would be arriving at about 3:30 in time to go and watch the 
		Germany quarter final. After Mark had checked into his hotel, we headed 
		up to the student area of town and found a pub to watch the game. We 
		were the only English people in the bar and once again the atmosphere 
		was excellent, as the Germans went through on penalties. We went for a 
		meal after the game and then found another bar for the Italy v Ukraine 
		game. Not too pissed by the time we got to bed at about mid-night.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 25 - 1st July 2006</font> </b>
		Quarter Final - England v Portugal. We met Mark at the railway station 
		and got the 9:11 to Gelsenkirchen. Picking up our tickets was relatively 
		painless and after a quick look around the town, we headed out to 
		Gelsenkirchen-Baur. We had chosen this are as it was a few tram stops 
		the other side of the ground meaning that it should be easier to get to 
		and form the game. Gelsenkirchen-Baur was also an area recommended for 
		eating and drinking by Free Lions. After ticking off another of my 300 
		beers at a street stall, we found an excellent pub where we stayed for a 
		few hours. We were joined by Dave and Glen and stayed in the pub until 
		3ish before getting the tram to the ground. Met Steve in the ground - he 
		had had a few problems getting his ticket due to his late arrival - and 
		had another couple of drinks before taking our seats.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0397.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">It 
		was another impressive ground with excellent views. It was by far the 
		most exciting game we have seen so far but once again, England missed 
		out on an excellent opportunity to get to a semi-final. Although they 
		had played reasonably well, once Rooney was sent off our best chance of 
		winning was gone. Once it went to penalties, the result seemed almost 
		inevitable although this was a poor shoot-out even by England's 
		standards. I think this defeat felt particularly painful as if just one 
		or two of our players had played to the best of their ability, beating 
		Portugal should have been easy. The fact that Brazil were to get knocked 
		out later in the evening, leaving the whole tournament wide open just 
		made things worse.</p>
		<p align="justify">Rather dejectedly we made our way back to 
		Gelsenkirchen-Baur as soon as the last penalty went in. Surprisingly, we 
		had a reasonably enjoyable evening in the same bar we had been in before 
		the game. We were joined again by Dave and Glenn as well as Roy and 
		Fred, Steve's friends. Watched the Brazil game and then made our way 
		back to Gelsenkirchen for the 23:56 train back to <font face="Times New Roman"> 
		Münster. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 26 - 2nd July 2006</font> </b>
		Woke up feeling depressed thinking of what might of been. I had been 
		really looking forward to a semi-final in Munich but it was not to be. 
		Time to change over to our non-football plan. We cancelled various 
		hotels that were booked for the latter stages and went off to say 
		goodbye to Mark. We wanted to head towards Regensburg to cycle down the 
		Danube again. We decided that as we were going to be pissed off all day 
		anyway, we may as well get most of the driving out of the
		<font face="Times New Roman">way in one go. We spent about five and a 
		half hours driving down to Dinckelsbühl, just South of Rothenburg on the 
		Romantic Road. We 
		found the campsite and pitched the tent in what is probably the nicest 
		spot we have camped at so far, at the side of a small lake with very few 
		other campers around us. We walked into Dinckelsbühl for our evening 
		meal. It seemed a very nice place but we were both tired and still not 
		too enthusiastic about doing anything so we had a meal and a couple of 
		drinks before returning to the tent for an early night.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 27 - 3rd July 2006</font> </b>
		We had planned to hire bikes today and cycle to one or two of the other 
		towns on the Romantic Road but the only place in
		<font face="Times New Roman">Dinckelsbühl that hired bikes, the tourist 
		information, had none available all week. This did not turn out too 
		badly. We spent a couple of hours walking around the town which was all 
		very scenic and then spent the rest of the day lazing around in the sun 
		by our tent.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We had found a shop that 
		sold another 4 of my 300 beers as well as a garage selling ice so we had 
		a few beers at the camp site before heading into Dinckelsbühl for tea. 
		Had a few more beers and we were both pretty pissed by the time we 
		walked back to the campsite.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 28 - 4th July 2006</font> </b>
		Had slight hangovers and decided to head up to Regensburg. After packing 
		up the tent, we had about 3 hours of driving and another hour of finding 
		our way into the town and trying to find accommodation, before settling 
		on another Ibis. We found out details of bike hire for tomorrow and had 
		a walk around some of the sights of the old town. In the evening, we 
		went out for a drink but did not fancy watching the Germany semi-final 
		with hundreds of Germans so went back to the hotel with a take-away.</p>
