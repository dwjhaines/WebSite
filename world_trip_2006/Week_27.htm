		Monday, 11th December 2006</font> </b>I was awake at about 6:30 due to 
		the amount of noise caused by the train being shunted around a station. 
		Once awake, I got up as I could not see anything from the top bunk. Roz 
		woke a couple of hours later and we had our beds converted back to seats so 
		we could sit down for the remainder of the journey. We got into Chiang Mai 
		slightly late at about 1:15, earlier than normal according to the French 
		family that we had been talking to on the train.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0101.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="left">The hotel we had booked in Chiang Mai was just across the road from the 
		station. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we made use of the 
		free internet access until it was sorted out. After showers we used the 
		internet again as we had tried to book a room at the same hotel for next 
		Saturday. This booking proved unsuccessful so we booked a different 
		hotel. We had expected to go into Chiang Mai by lunchtime but it was 
		already past that time so we 
		decided that we should stay a second night here instead of leaving 
		tomorrow. To get the hotel we are already in at the cheaper rate, we had to 
		contact the booking agency via an internet chat room while they were in 
		contact with the hotel by phone and the hotel staff were coming over to 
		discuss the booking with us. It was all far more complicated than it 
		needed to be but it meant we saved about 40% on the room rate. We also 
		have to move to an executive room tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was getting on for 3:30 by this time. We walked into the centre of 
		Chiang Mai where we finally had lunch. We had a short walk around 
		stopping at a couple of wats (which were closing by this time). We also 
		found a very good second hand book shop where I got rid of the books I 
		had been carrying in exchange for two that I had been looking for. We had a quick look at the 
		night market before heading back to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were both pretty knackered by this time and did not feel like walking 
		back into town to go to the Riverside Restaurant as planned. We ate in 
		the hotel restaurant instead and were in bed by 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We spent a couple of hours at the pool in the morning and eventually 
		moved to our executive room just after 1pm. After sorting out the room, 
		we walked back into Chiang 
		Mai and headed to McDonalds for lunch. On the way we managed to buy a 
		couple of pairs of the shorts that we have both been wearing for years. 
		My last pair had just about become un-wearable and we had not seen them 
		on sale for a while so this was quite a find. After eating, we spent a few hours wandering around more wats. A few of them we had been to already when we were here 
		six years ago but they were still spectacular to look around.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We made it out to The Riverside Restaurant in the evening which was 
		excellent again. After we had eaten, we returned to the night market and 
		got two more pairs of shorts as well as a bag to leave some of our 
		belongings in when we leave Chiang Mai for a few days tomorrow. Got a 
		tuk-tuk back to the hotel by about 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 13th December 2006</font> </b>
		We left the hotel at about 9:45 having left our diving gear and one 
		other bag in the hotel's luggage room. We got a tuk-tuk to the bus 
		station and bought tickets for the 10:30 bus to Pai. The bus was fairly 
		old, non air-conditioned, totally 
		full and not overly comfortable, but despite all this, the four hour journey was not too bad 
		and quite scenic.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2202.JPG" width="260" height="195" align="left">We did not leave Chiang Mai until about 10:50 
		and we stopped for lunch en-route so eventually got to Pai just after 3.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had phoned ahead and reserved a room in a place just outside the 
		centre of Pai. It was about a 1km walk from the bus station and we 
		checked in to another good room for Baht700 a night. We had an hour or 
		so in the sun before it set and then showered and walked back into the 
		centre. It seemed quite a nice place and could definitely be described 
		as a &quot;backpacker centre&quot;. We ate at the restaurant that Lonely Planet 
		reckons served the best pizzas in Thailand. I am not sure how accurate 
		that description is but the pizzas were excellent.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 14th December 2006</font> </b>
		We were quite late getting up and ate breakfast at the hotel. After 
		breakfast, we walked up to a wat on a hill in a village just outside 
		Pai. The walk only took about 20 minutes each way so was not too tiring, 
		but the views from the wat were pretty good. We walked back into Pai as 
		we had decided that we would go for a massage. The place recommended in 
		the book was busy but we made appointments for 1pm which gave us about 
		an hour to kill back at the room.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The massage lasted for an hour and cost us B150 each. It was all very 
		relaxing and we both really enjoyed it, probably more than we had 
		expected to. The hour went very quickly and we could easily of gone for 
		the two hour option without getting bored. We had lunch in Pai and 
		headed back to the hotel for another couple of hours in the sun.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the same pizza restaurant as yesterday for tea, had a few 
		bottles of Leo with our meal (the same two pizzas as yesterday) and were back in the room by 9.</p>

		Checked out of our room just after 7:30 and walked down to the bus 
		station for the 8:30 bus to Mae Hong Son. We were at the bus station 
		before 8 but were already too late to get a seat as they had all been 
		taken, mainly by locals who obviously knew what they were doing. We 
		ended up sat at the front of the bus on the engine compartment. This 
		turned out to be more comfortable than the normal seats, particularly 
		after the breakfast stop at Soppong, where a lot of people got off the 
		bus. The journey took just over 3<font face="Times New Roman">½ hours 
		and was once again, very scenic. Sitting at the front gave us excellent 
		views and it was quite an enjoyable journey.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">At </font>Mae Hong Son we walked to a hotel 
		near the lake in the centre of town and checked into a room for B600. We 
		wandered around the lake which was pleasant enough and checked e-mail 
		before having lunch. By the time we had eaten, it was gone 3 and we 
		walked up the hill to the main sight in Mae Hong Son, &quot;Wat Phra That Doi 
		Kong Mu&quot;. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2240.JPG" width="271" height="203" align="left">It took about 30 - 40 minutes to walk up the hill via the 
		road. At the top, the wat was pretty good and the views of the town 
		itself and the surrounding countryside were excellent. We walked back 
		down into town via a set of steps, definitely the shorter route!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We 
		had not been sure where we would eat tonight as there was nowhere that 
		got a particularly good write-up in Lonely Planet. However, when we came 
		out of the hotel, a night market had been set up along the edge of the 
		lake. We chose our meals from different stalls and ate sitting at the 
		lakeside. It was excellent food in a really nice setting. We wandered round the other stalls before taking banana 
		pancakes back to eat on our balcony.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0160.JPG" width="261" height="195" align="right">Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 16th December 2006</font> </b>
		We got up early so that we could climb up to Wat Phra That Doi 
		Kong Mu again to get the views of the mist over the town. We walked up 
		the steps and were at the top before 7:45. The whole place was still&nbsp; 
		in cloud and the views were not that spectacular. However, we stayed at 
		the top for about an hour while the mist started to clear and the views 
		were once again very good.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked back down the steps again and returned to our hotel for 
		showers followed by breakfast in the hotel restaurant, overlooking the 
		lake.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We checked out of the hotel at 10:30 and walked to the airport which was 
		only about 500m away. We checked in without any problems and took off on 
		time at 11:55. Half an hour later, we landed in Chiang Mai, collected 
		our luggage and got a taxi to the hotel. The hotel was all a bit 
		strange, being split into two different parts, on different levels, with 
		a conference hall just off reception and an attached shopping centre. 
		The whole place was very similar in age and standards to The Asia Hotel 
		in Bangkok. The room was fine and the shopping centre had a food hall for 
		lunch. We got a taxi to the Bossotel and back to collect our left 
		luggage and were back in our room by about 3.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2257.JPG" width="197" height="263" align="left">We did not do a lot else for the rest of the afternoon. We had a look 
		around the shopping centre which was not as good as MBK but had enough 
		to look around for an hour or so. We went out just before 6. We walked 
		through the old town, a lot of which had been turned into a street 
		market and stopped for a couple of wheat beers before heading out to The 
		Riverside. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and bought another 
		bottle to drink in the room while listening to world Service (Swansea 5, 
		Carlisle 0).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 17th December 2006</font> </b>We 
		checked out of the hotel at 9:30 and got a taxi to the airport for the 
		11:15 flight to Phuket. After checking in, we changed the return part of 
		the ticket so that we can just fly to Bangkok on Jan 3rd and not Chiang 
		Mai. This was a free &quot;reward&quot; flight so we had not known if this would 
		be possible or not.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		When we got through to the gate, there were a couple of desks selling 
		transfers to Phi Phi that would get us to Phi Phi today. We had planned 
		to stay in Phuket but this seemed a good option as we would have to go 
		to Phi Phi to get to Lanta tomorrow anyway. This ticket cost B1000 each 
		and included the transfer from Phuket airport and the through boat 
		ticket to Lanta. We landed slightly late in Phuket and by the time we 
		had found the transfer vehicle, we only had about 40 minutes to get to 
		the ferry pier. We arrived at the pier at about a minute after the 
		departure time and just got on the boat before it left. The journey took 
		about 90 minutes and we arrived in Phi Phi just after 4.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We checked into a bungalow near the ferry pier. We took the first 
		bungalow we looked at for B1200 a night. I could not be bothered to look 
		around too much as I was feeling hung-over and we had too much luggage 
		to carry, but the room we got was pretty good value compared to others 
		we looked at later on. The room was not air-conditioned but the hotel 
		had a pool which we were both in within about 10 minutes of checking in!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Once the sun had gone down, we went out for a sandwich (we had not 
		really had any lunch) and a look around. Most of the island seems to 
		have returned to the way it was pre-tsunami. We looked at a few places 
		to stay as we are thinking about coming back here for a few days at the 
		end of January but a lot of places have gone upmarket since being 
		rebuilt and did not seem particularly good value. We ate at our hotel 
		restaurant which is on the sea front - probably a more enjoyable meal 
		than the ones we had eaten at the Riverside!</p>
