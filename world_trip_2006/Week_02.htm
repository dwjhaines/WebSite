		After an hour or so lying in the sun, we packed up our tent and drove 
		the short distance to Nurnberg where England play their second game 
		tomorrow. We found the hotel easily enough and were relieved to find 
		that the hotel had a car-park and allowed us to check in early. Mark 
		arrived shortly after us and the three of us set of for a days drinking.</p>
		<p align="justify">It turned out to be an excellent day. We started off 
		in the Bratwust House near the main square before heading out to the 
		fans cricket event in a near by park. We did not make it quite as far as 
		the cricket match but had a couple in a beer garden<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0155.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left"> 
		where we met another of Mark's Palace mates. At 6 ish we went back to 
		the Bratwurst House where Roy joined us. We went up to the restaurant 
		underneath the castle for another couple and then returned to the 
		Bratwurst House for the third time today. By the time we got there, it 
		was totally packed due to the Germans playing at 9pm. We had seats as we 
		had reserved a table but the service was so poor that Mark and I had 
		still not got our drinks 50 minutes after ordering. We left at half time 
		and headed back to the area around the castle which was not as busy. We 
		found an excellent bar where we stayed for the rest of the night. 
		Neither me, Mark or Roz remember leaving the bar but apparently we woke 
		Steve up at 2:30 when we got back to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 9 - 15th June 2006</font> </b>
		The second England game was due to kick off at 6pm. I met up with Steve, 
		Mark and Roy at the hotel reception at mid-day and we headed into the 
		centre of Nurnberg. It was another very hot day and the whole area was 
		already packed with England fans. We met up with some more of Steve's 
		fiends in a cafe and, after Roz had joined us, headed back to the castle 
		restaurant which was not as busy. We spent an enjoyable couple of hours 
		there before getting a bus to to the ground. No problems getting in to 
		the ground again. We were sat with Steve this time but not with Mark as 
		he got his ticket in the second allocation. Not the best of games but 
		the win meant that we had qualified for the second round - our best 
		start since 1982.</p>
		<p align="justify">We got the train back into Nurnberg after the game 
		and met up for a few more drinks but had a relatively quiet and early 
		night.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0203.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="right">Day 
		10 - 16th June 2006</font> </b>Checked out of the hotel at 12 and drove 
		up to Limburg, about 50 miles South of Cologne. We eventually found the 
		camp site and erected our tent in about half of the time that our first 
		attempt took. Steve turned up with Kelly and Kim at 6ish. After they had 
		pitched their tent next to ours, we left them at the camp-site and 
		headed into the old town to meet Regan and Annette who have flown out 
		for the weekend. Limburg was an excellent place for a session and we 
		ended up staying out until the pub we were in closed at 2am. Do not 
		remember a lot about the walk back to the camp-site!</p>

		With the exception of an hour or so wandering around the sights of 
		Limburg, we spent just about the whole day in beer gardens or bars. 
		Before meeting Regan and Annette, we went round the cathedral and 
		wandered around the old town for an hour or so.&nbsp;We briefly saw 
		Steve, Kim and Kelly again before they headed off to a more 
		child-friendly camp site.</p>
		<p align="justify">We started drinking in a beer garden near the river 
		where we stayed for a couple of hours. We then wandered back into the 
		old town and went round a few bars before ending up in the same place we 
		had been in last night. No one really remembers the latter stages of the 
		night but somehow we managed to stay in the bar until 2am again. A very 
		good day out!</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 12 - 18th June 2006</font> </b>
		We went into Limburg to say goodbye to Regan&nbsp; and Annette at about 
		1pm but did not do a lot else all day due to hangovers. We went back 
		into the old town for a pizza in the evening but were in our sleeping 
		bags in the tent by about 9:30. During the night, there was a heavy 
		thunder storm and it looked as if the tent was not going to be able to 
		keep out the rain. Water had started coming in but after the storm had 
		passed and the rain had eased off a bit, no more came in and we could go 
		back to sleep.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 13 - 19th June 2006</font> </b>
		After drying out the tent in the sun for an hour, we left the camp site 
		to drive up to Cologne. The drive took about an hour but it took almost 
		as long again to find the hotel where we were staying. The street was 
		not marked on our map so Roz had phoned for directions. The directions 
		were slightly inaccurate which meant we were looking on slightly the 
		wrong place and we were not helped by the one way system and more 
		torrential rain making road signs almost impossible to read. We 
		eventually checked in to a room/apartment and went off to park the car 
		about a mile away - the closest free parking.</p>
		<p align="justify">After we had eaten lunch, showered, etc, we walked 
		into the centre of the old town. The whole area was already filling up 
		with fans for tomorrows game. We climbed the tower of the very 
		impressive cathedral for the views of the city and then caught a train 
		out to Dussleldorf where we had arranged to meet up with Mark, Steve, 
		etc who had been to a game in Dortmund. Spent most of the night in the 
		Zum Uerige brewery apart from when Roz and I went off to try and tick 
		off another couple of beers from my beer list. Got the train back to 
		Cologne at about 23:45.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 14 - 20th June 2006</font> </b>
		We went back into town at about 12:30 by which time the place was 
		totally packed.
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0281.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">There 
		were reportedly 90,000 English and Swedish fans in town as well as all 
		the Germans who were there to watch the final German group game on the 
		big screens that had been erected in the city centre. We managed to get 
		a table at the Frue Brewery at 1:30 and stayed there for an hour or so 
		but then struggled to find anywhere where we could watch the German 
		game. There were 8 of us wandering around by this stage and everywhere 
		was either totally full or did not have a tele. Eventually we found a 
		small bar that we could just about all get into and see the tele. Spent 
		a couple of hours in there drinking Kolsch and watching the Germans win 
		3 - 0 to go top of their group. Excellent atmosphere during and after 
		the game!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0291.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">We 
		tried to find another bar to go to before heading out to the stadium but 
		ended up all going for a pizza - not what we had planned but it worked 
		out quite well. We gat a tram out to the stadium at about 19:30 and 
		eventually got into our seats about 15 minutes before kick-off (21:00). 
		Once again, not a great game but a draw with the Swedes meant we won our 
		group and avoided playing the Germans in the next round. We had played 
		our best football of the tournament so far for 45 minutes but had once 
		again fallen apart in the second half.</p>
		<p align="justify">After the game, the tram took us back to Neumarkt, 
		which was near our hotel, so we did not bother going into the city 
		centre with everyone else.</p>
