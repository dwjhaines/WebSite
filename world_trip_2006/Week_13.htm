		Another day spent not doing a lot. Had a couple of hours either by the 
		pool or on the beach and spent quite a bit of time sitting on the 
		balcony admiring the view. We decided that we would have less to drink 
		this evening as we leave tomorrow, but we returned to the same 
		restaurant as yesterday and ended up having almost the same amount 
		again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 5th September 2006</font> </b>
		We checked out of our hotel and got the 11:15 bus from Batsi to the port 
		for the mid-day ferry back to Rafina. At Rafina, we got straight onto 
		another bus and were back in the centre of Athens just after 3pm. We 
		walked down towards the railway station and Roz checked into a hotel 
		just across the road. The pool was not up to much so we spent a couple 
		of hours sleeping until&nbsp; about 7. We walked back to the parliament 
		building again and watched the changing of the guard again - just as 
		funny second time around - and ate at our &quot;usual&quot; kebab restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After we had walked back to the hotel, it was time to say goodbye. I 
		left Roz at the hotel and walked across the road to the station. I had 
		about 45 minutes to wait for the 22:57 train to Thessaloniki. The train 
		was on time and I was sharing the compartment with three Greek blokes. 
		The couchettes were cooler than usual as everyone was happy to leave all 
		doors and windows open meaning that there was plenty of air. There was 
		also plenty of noise and light so still did not get too much sleep.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 6th September 2006</font> </b>
		I was woken up at 5:30 as the train entered Thessaloniki having had a 
		maximum of about three hours sleep. At Thessaloniki station, I needed to 
		get an onward ticket to Skopje for the train at 8:20. The international 
		ticket office was closed so I went and found the hotel where I am booked 
		in for tomorrow night. I asked about leaving my rucksack there while I 
		went to Skopje and was told to leave it on the floor opposite reception. 
		I was not too happy with this but I was repeatedly told not to worry and 
		that it would be OK. I returned to the station and bought my ticket (€22 
		return) and then got a cheese pie for breakfast. By this time I had decided that I probably would worry about my rucksack 
		and went to retrieve it from the hotel lobby. I carried it back to the 
		station and waited on the platform for the train.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The train left on time and took just over 5 hours to get to Skopje 
		including 90 minutes at the border. I arrived in Skopje at 11:50 local 
		time and then spent 45 minutes walking to the hotel we had booked. The 
		Lonely Planet map was not ideal and not many of the streets had names 
		which did not help. After a much needed shower and a few texts and phone 
		calls, I found out where Steve was drinking and walked back into the 
		centre of town.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7019.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right"></p>
		<p align="justify">
		I met up with Mark and Steve at an Irish bar near the river in the 
		centre of the city. Also there were two of Steve's mates from work, a 
		Macedonian/English couple who live in Skopje, Janet and another woman 
		who had met up with Mark and Janet on the trip out. After a visit to 
		englandfans to register, we walked away from the crowds to a restaurant 
		that the local couple knew about. After eating a pretty good (and 
		remarkably cheap) meal, four of us (me, Mark, Janet and the woman whose 
		name I never found out) walked across the stone bridge and found a bar 
		where we spent the rest of the afternoon. We were joined by everyone 
		else during the evening and remained there until about 8 when we started 
		making our way to the ground. Once again, it was very cheap with beer 
		less than €1 a pint.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Getting into the ground was relatively easy compared to some trips. 
		There was no comparison between the way the police treated us here and 
		in Bratislava. Everything was far more relaxed and better organised and 
		we got ourselves a pretty good place to stand with 30 minutes until 
		kick-off. The game was nothing special but once again, England got the 
		result that mattered. After the game, we said goodbye to those on the 
		day trips and I walked back into town with Steve. We returned to the 
		bars by the river, met up with his mates again and walked back to the 
		hotel when everything started closing down at about 1.</p>

		Met Steve, Nick and Dave at breakfast and we all agreed to check-out at 
		10:15. I went down to pay my bill and after a slight disagreement, I 
		managed to get a receipt in Roz's name for her &quot;proof of travel&quot; so that 
		she should still be able to claim her caps. Once we had all checked out, 
		we headed out for a bit of sightseeing, mainly wandering around the old 
		part of town and the market which was all pretty good. After walking 
		round for an hour or so, the others went for a drink while I got my hair 
		cut. This included having my ear hair removed with a cigarette lighter 
		which was a new experience!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I met up with everyone briefly before heading off on my own again 
		to look around the old fort, something the others had done yesterday. We 
		met again for lunch before the others returned to the hotel for their 
		taxi to the airport. I wandered round for another hour, picked up my 
		luggage from the hotel and got a taxi to the train station.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I arrived at the station at 3:30, not knowing the time of my train to 
		Thessaloniki other than that it was sometime between 16:00 and 17:00. As 
		it was, it should have been 16:00, eventually came in over two hours 
		late, and did not leave until 18:10. The scenes when the train came in 
		were reminiscent of the old days of the Belgrade - Athens trains twenty 
		years ago with people desperately trying to get on to get seats. I got a 
		seat as did another English bloke I had been talking to while waiting 
		but for the first part of the journey, there were loads of people 
		standing in the corridor. Unlike twenty years ago, most of the people 
		got off after the first few stops and by the time we reached the border, 
		we had a compartment to ourselves. Eventually arrived in Thessaloniki at 
		11:45. The bloke I had been travelling with found out that he could 
		continue travelling and get an overnight train to Athens. I walked 
		across the road and checked into Hotel Rex.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 8th September 2006</font> </b>After about 4 
		hours sleep, I was awake at 4:45 and checked out of the hotel just after 
		5. I waited about 20 minutes for the airport bus and arrived at the 
		airport just after 6am. The flight home was uneventful and I arrived at 
		Gatwick just after 9. By the time we had been allocated a gate and my 
		luggage had come through, It was 10:30. After a lot of confusion, I got 
		the 11:03 train to North Camp, near Farnborough. I had time for a pint 
		before Roz collected me in her hire car and we drove to Aleks and Andi's 
		house. We went to a pub for lunch and, after Andi had returned from 
		work, had a bar-b-q and spent the evening consuming 9 bottles of wine.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 9th September 2006</font> </b>Woke up with 
		hangover and a cold and felt pretty rough. We departed from Farnborough 
		at 10:30 and drove to Gatwick where we returned the hire car. We checked 
		in, tried to buy the Egypt Lonely Planet (unsuccessfully) and went to 
		McDonalds for lunch. There were long queues for security checks but we 
		just made it through and the plane departed about 30 minutes late at 
		2:30. The flight to Sharm el Sheikh, was about 5 hours and we arrived at 
		9:15pm local time</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time we arrived in Sharm I was still feeling rough and also very 
		tired. The effects of the alcohol consumed in the last week and a lack 
		of sleep seemed to be finally taking its toll. We got through 
		immigration reasonably quickly, got our luggage and after a few 
		arguments, got a taxi to our hotel for £5. The hotel did not have our 
		reservation which meant that despite arriving at about 10:30pm, our room 
		was not ready. It took about half an hour to sort this out and by the 
		time we got into the room, we were both totally knackered. We could not 
		be bothered to go out to eat so I went and got our second meal of the 
		day from McDonalds and we ate our burgers in the room. We discovered 
		that we had free internet access in the room so spent half an hour or so 
		looking at the football results before going to bed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 10th September 2006</font> </b>We were only 
		booked into our hotel in Sharm for one night but decided to stay for a 
		second. We are in a nice hotel and I am still not feeling 100%. We had 
		planned to get an overnight bus to Luxor (12 hours) but that did not appeal as much 
		of having a relaxing day of not doing a lot other than sitting by the 
		pool.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went for a walk around Sharm after breakfast and managed to find a 
		souvenir shop that had a copy of the Egypt Lonely Planet which we bought 
		for the same price as we would of paid at home. This meant that we could 
		start looking in a bit more detail at what we would be doing for the 
		next 10 days until we return to Sharm. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0001.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">We spent some time at the pool 
		before lunch and then I walked out to the bus station to buy tickets for 
		the bus tomorrow (Roz made it about two thirds of the way there before 
		giving up and returning to the pool). After a hot 45 minute walk, I was told that it was not 
		possible to buy tickets in advance and we should buy them tomorrow on 
		the bus! Had another hot walk back and spent the rest of the afternoon 
		by the pool.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the evening, we were slightly more adventurous than last night and 
		ate in a more traditional Egyptian restaurant. Were back in the hotel 
		just after 9 and had an early night.</p>
