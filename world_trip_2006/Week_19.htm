		Monday, 16th October 2006</font> </b>Woke at 7 and left immediately for 
		Heathrow. We left the car (containing Paddy, Patty and Lee) at Economy 
		Parking and were driven to Terminal 4. We had already checked in on-line 
		so just had to collect our boarding passes and give in our luggage.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had breakfast once through security, bought a few things that we 
		needed for the trip and boarded the plane for Nairobi just after the 
		scheduled departure time of 10:15.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The flight was uneventful and we arrived in Nairobi at 8:55pm (two hours 
		ahead of UK). We bought our visas and collected our luggage fairly 
		quickly and were then relieved to find someone waiting for us as we came 
		through arrivals. Roz had pre-booked our first couple of nights 
		accommodation with the same company that we will use for our safari and 
		they were at the airport to drive us to the hotel. We had checked into 
		our hotel by 10 and after a quick look around, had an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 17th October 2006</font> </b>
		After breakfast we ventured outside our hotel for the first time. We got 
		a taxi into the centre of Nairobi. It was not far to walk but we had 
		US$1200 to pay our safari company in cash. We were in the safari office 
		for quite a while sorting out what we are doing and eventually paying 
		for it all. We were shown a couple for choices for accommodation for 
		when we return to Nairobi and eventually chose a more expensive option 
		than the one we had originally booked.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We spent another couple of hours in the centre. There was not a lot to 
		see but we had a few things to sort out such as postcards, checking 
		e-mail, etc. We had lunch, bought what we needed for the next couple of 
		days and walked back to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate our evening meal (chicken curries with varying amounts of meat) 
		in the hotel restaurant due to it not being safe to leave the hotel on 
		foot after about 6:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 18th October 2006</font> </b>
		We were picked up from our hotel by Best Camping at 9 and were driven to 
		their office again. We were given a brief about what we may see in the 
		next few days and, after loading the mini-bus with food, we headed off 
		for the Maasai Mara. We were fortunate that there was just me and Roz in 
		the minibus together with our guide/driver - Mustafa.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We drove North of Nairobi and along one side of the Rift Valley before 
		dropping down and crossing the valley floor. Her we saw our first 
		giraffe of the day, fairly close to the road.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		A lot of the afternoon was fairly boring, driving along a pot-holed, 
		dusty road. The scenery got more interesting as we got closer to the 
		Maasai Mara and we finally entered the park gates at 4:45.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0061.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">After 
		our first encounter with the Maasai souvenir sellers, we started driving 
		towards our camp and were instantly impressed. Within the first few 
		minutes, we had seen wildebeest, buffalo, gazelle and came very close to 
		a couple of elephants (mother and 14 year old &quot;baby&quot;) We continued to 
		see plenty of animals - more than we had both expected - but the 
		highlight was a herd of six elephants. We saw them from a distance and 
		drove closer to them until we eventually blocked their path. They walked 
		to within a couple of metres of us until we drove out of their way.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We continued to the campsite spotting about 10 - 15 hyenas on the way. 
		The campsite was basic but fine for a couple of nights. We were shown to 
		our two-man tent and given blankets. We had showers (hot) and then went 
		to the &quot;eating hut&quot; for tea. There were only us and four French people 
		staying at the campsite. Tea was surprisingly good but there was not a 
		lot to do once we had eaten so we were in our tent by 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 19th October 2006</font> </b>
		We were up at 6 for the first game drive of the day at 6:30. The drive 
		started in the same way as yesterdays - plenty of animals including a 
		group of giraffe that we were very close to.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0100.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">After 
		about 10 minutes, our driver found out that cheetahs had been spotted 
		and we headed off in that direction. When we found the cheetahs, there 
		were three of them and once again we were able to get very close to 
		them. This was fairly spectacular but we watched as they spotted a group 
		of wildebeest and spent about 20 minutes stalking them before moving in 
		for the kill. Apparently this is quite a rare sight and we were lucky to 
		be able to witness it. The three cheetah then set about eating their 
		prey while being watched by about 20 minibuses. They were not bothered 
		by our presence and it made for some excellent photos.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the scene later in the drive when the carcass had been 
		almost stripped clean and the vultures waited to move in for the scraps. 
		We returned to the camp for breakfast before the second drive of the day 
		at 10:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0143.JPG" width="269" height="193" align="left">This 
		drive was never going to be as spectacular as the others as most of the 
		wildlife is asleep at this time. However, we returned to the carcass of 
		the wildebeest to watch the vultures finishing it off and then found the 
		three cheetahs, looking totally full, sleeping under a tree. Also saw 
		hippos in the river.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The third drive of the day, after sitting around for a couple of hours 
		at the campsite was at 4pm. We did not see many animals but we were 
		driven to a waterhole where there were three lions sleeping. We watched 
		them for about 10 minutes during which time they woke up and moved 
		around for photos. The drive was slightly curtailed due to suspension 
		problems with our van but it was an excellent end to the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were joined in the camp by four female, English vets so we had 
		someone to talk to at tea. Another good meal and another early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Left the camp at 8 (saw a lion while driving out through the park) and 
		spent the next 6<font face="Times New Roman">½ hours driving to Nakuru. 
		We ate lunch in a restaurant in the town and entered the National Park 
		at 3:20. It was another spectacular drive. We had our first sight of the 
		1000's of flamingos that live at the lake and also a white rhino. We 
		spent a bit of time admiring the views from the &quot;Baboon Cliff&quot; view 
		point and were then told about some lions further around the lake. We 
		spotted another white rhino en route to the lions.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We saw two young male lions playing by the 
		side of the lake and, slightly further away, two sleepy females. We 
		drove away from the lions as it was raining and we were concerned about 
		getting stuck in the mud, so we returned to the second rhino. Once the 
		rain stopped, we returned to the female lions. We watched them not doing 
		a lot for about 10 minutes before deciding to move on. However, the 
		minibus would not start and we were stuck for about 45 minutes. During 
		this time, the two male lions came to join the females and a few more 
		appeared - in total there were eight of them around us. The light was 
		starting to fade to add to the excitement but we were eventually rescued 
		when another Best Camping minibus turned up. We joined a Spanish couple 
		in their bus and left Mustafa alone with the lions and several other 
		minibuses. We returned to the park entrance (spotting a black rhino on 
		the way) to summon assistance for Mustafa, but while we were there he 
		turned up having got the van started when he was the last one there 
		alone with the lions.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We all proceeded to the Gracelands Hotel, 
		just outside Nakuru, had another good meal and early night.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 20th October 2006</font> </b>
		We left Nakuru at 8 for the journey back to Nairobi. The minibus had yet 
		another suspension problem which required a 45 minute visit to a 
		mechanic on the way and we eventually got into Nairobi at about 12:30. 
		We collected our rucksacks from the Best Camping office, tipped Mustafa 
		KSH2000 (about £15) and checked into the SixEighty Hotel just over the 
		road. Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Had lunch, checked 
		e-mail and listened to World Service. Had evening meal in hotel 
		restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 21st October 2006</font> </b>
		We were collected from our hotel at 8:45 by Daniel, the taxi driver who 
		had taken us into Best Camping on Tuesday. We had arranged for him to 
		take us to the &quot;Safari Walk&quot; and the Sheldrick elephant orphanage.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0284.JPG" width="261" height="196" align="left">We 
		started at the safari walk by the entrance to Nairobi National Park. All 
		the animals there have been orphaned or rescued. It was a bit like being 
		in a zoo to start with but it was good being able to get closer to some 
		of the animals we have already seen. Our guide got into the rhino 
		enclosure and invited me to get in. I climbed the fence and he took 
		photos of me while I stroked the white rhino - an incredible experience. 
		After that, we saw lions, a leopard (only just) and then moved to the 
		cheetahs. There were two cheetahs in their enclosure. We had seen 
		pictures of people stroking them and we were keen to do the same, One of 
		the cheetahs was lying by the entrance and was perfectly happy to let us 
		stroke it and play with it. He purred contentedly while we scratched his 
		neck - so like Harvey it was untrue! It was unbelievable that this was 
		the same thing that we had seen capture and eat a wildebeest a few days 
		ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0365.jpg" width="266" height="200" align="right">We 
		moved from the safari walk to the elephant orphanage in time for the 11 
		o'clock feeding. There were more visitors there than we had expected but 
		it was still another incredible experience. We saw nine elephants aged 
		between 6 weeks and 18 months as they were fed and bathed. Again, the 
		elephants came right up to us and were not afraid to be stroked by 
		everyone watching. We watched them for an hour before heading back to 
		Nairobi. Both places had been excellent and it had been a very enjoyable 
		and unforgettable morning.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent most of the day either in the room or on the internet although we 
		did venture out of the hotel for a short walk and for lunch (Swansea 2, 
		Millwall 0).</p>
