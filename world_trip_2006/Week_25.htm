		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 27th November 2006</font> </b>The start of the second half of 
		our World Trip - the beginning of six months in S. E. Asia.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were up at 7 and collected by taxi from Cathy's at 8. Our bus left 
		The Quadrant a few minutes late, just after 9 and we had an uneventful 
		journey to Heathrow where we arrived on time at 1:20. We checked in 
		immediately for our flight at 4:20 and killed time in the departure 
		lounge until boarding. The flight was a bit late taking off but we 
		arrived in Amman at about10:50 local time and had an hour wait for the 
		onward flight to Bangkok. We left the gate on time but had an hour delay 
		due to technical difficulties once the engines had started and did not 
		depart until about 1am. We had another meal, a glass of wine and managed 
		to get some sleep.</p>

		We slept reasonably well for about 3 - 4 hours. Both flights had been 
		less than half full meaning that we had extra seats. Royal Jordanian 
		were certainly not the best airline we have ever flown with but the 
		extra space made the journey one of the most comfortable we have had out 
		to Thailand. We touched down at the new Bangkok Airport just before 3pm. 
		It was not too different an experience to arriving at the old airport - 
		queue for immigration, collect luggage and proceed to meter taxi stand - 
		and we were safely in our room in The Asia Hotel within about 90 minutes 
		of landing.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out to stock up on drinks from the 7-11, had much needed showers 
		and started on the alcohol at about 6:30. I started on the beer, Roz on 
		the Sang Som. We went to our usual restaurant in Siam Square for our 
		evening meal and got through a bottle of Mekong. We stopped for another 
		bottle on the way back to the hotel and finished the end of the first 
		one we had bought back in the room. I do not remember much after the 
		second bottle.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We had to get up early to try and sort out our visas for Myanmar. We got 
		up at 7:30. I was feeling a bit rough but Roz had one of her traditional 
		Mekong hangovers and was not feeling at all well. We got the sky train 
		to the nearest station to the Myanmar embassy which was then just a 5 
		minute walk away. We joined the queue at 8:15 with no real idea of how 
		long we were going to have to be there, having read of very inefficient 
		service and long unsuccessful waits. We entered the embassy at 8:45 and 
		they finally started processing customers at about 9:15. We were 6th on 
		the list for individual applicants and handed in our forms by 9:45. We 
		paid Baht 810 each for the visas and an additional 225 each to be able 
		to collect them tomorrow instead of Friday. We got the sky train back to 
		the MBK Centre so that we could go to McDonalds for breakfast. Roz was 
		still not well but managed to eat her burger.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0009.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="right">Back at the hotel, Roz went straight back to sleep and after an hour or 
		so I was also asleep. By 2, we woke up feeling a lot better than we had 
		done previously. We went to have a look at another hotel as The Asia 
		Hotel is becoming a bit expensive, then returned to the MBK for lunch 
		and an hour or so looking round the shops.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel, we both went off to use the internet for about an 
		hour each, before we went out for tea. Instead of our usual restaurant, 
		we went to an all you can eat bar-b-q place opposite the Asia Hotel. The 
		food was&nbsp; pretty good and incredible value for only Baht 89 each.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 30th November 2006</font> </b>
		Up at about 8 and we both headed straight out to the main train station 
		to book our overnight train tickets to Chiang Mai for 10 days time. We 
		got the tickets without any problems but it was a good thing that we 
		went when we did as all trains a couple of days before were booked and 
		there were only a few berths left on one train for the day we wanted to 
		travel. We had breakfast in the station food centre and returned to the 
		hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At about 10:45 we checked out of the hotel. I then went to collect our 
		passports from the Myanmar Embassy while Roz checked to see if we had 
		manages to book a hotel for tonight. The passport collection went as 
		well as could be hoped for with only a 20 minute queue and I was back at 
		the hotel by midday. Roz was not so lucky with the hotel reservation - 
		the internet company could not sort out the reservation at such short 
		notice - so we decided to start heading for Koh Chang immediately. We 
		got the Sky Train out to the Eastern bus station and bought tickets for 
		the 1:15 bus to Trat. We had lunch while waiting for the bus and 
		departed just about on time. The bus was air-conditioned and reasonably 
		comfortable and we arrived at Trat just before 6:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got dropped outside the centre of Trat due to the opening of a new 
		bus station since our book was written, and had to get a songthaew into 
		town. We got a room in the second hotel we looked at for Baht150, 
		probably the cheapest room we have had so far on this trip. After 
		showering, we went out to the 
		night market to eat - it was good food and again, very cheap.. I got my hair cut on the way back to the hotel and 
		we were back in the room by 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 1st December 2006</font> </b>We were up at 
		7:30 and went out to get breakfast before checking out of the hotel. We 
		got another songthaew out to the pier at Laem Ngop about 20 minutes away 
		and caught the 9:00 ferry across to Koh Chang. There were not too many 
		options for transport when we arrived in Koh Chang about 50 minutes 
		later and we eventually had to share a taxi with another couple for 
		Baht100 each to get to White Sand Beach. We were dropped at the Northern 
		end of the beach and started looking for a room for the 8 or 9 nights we 
		are planning to stay. It was too hot for walking around with rucksacks 
		so after finding a room we both liked, Roz spent 30 minutes or so 
		looking around for an alternative while I stayed with the luggage. She 
		did not find anything that she preferred so we checked into the Lagoon 
		Resort. It cost slightly more than we were hoping to pay but was a 
		really nice big room with a good balcony and views of the beach.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0025.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left"></p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went for a walk around the beach area which all seems quite nice. We 
		had been warned that it was more developed than some beaches on the 
		island but it was nothing like Samui or Phuket and has probably about 
		the right amount of shops and restaurants for us. We ate lunch in one of 
		the beachside restaurants and spent the remainder of the afternoon lying 
		on the beach in front of our hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went for another walk to the other end of the beach as the sun was 
		starting to set and then I left Roz on the beach and went for a run for 
		the first time in over 6 months. This was the start of my attempt to get 
		fit again and lose some weight. I ran the full length of the beach and 
		back in about 15 minutes and did not feel too bad at the end of it. When 
		we returned to the room, we discovered that Roz had managed to lose the 
		key on the beach. We returned to the beach to look for it but there was 
		not much chance due to the fading light. I got a replacement from 
		reception but it looks as if we have lost our Baht 500 key deposit.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate at our hotel restaurant which was right on the beach and served 
		excellent food. After another walk on the beach we returned to the room.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 2nd December 2006</font> </b>
		Spent most of the day lying on the beach. On our way back from lunch, we 
		booked ourselves onto a days diving trip for tomorrow. We discovered 
		that we can get free wi-fi in the hotel reception (but not in the room) 
		so made use of that to try and sort out accommodation in Chaing Mai and 
		Bangkok (without much success). I ran along the beach for about 26 
		minutes before giving up. It rained in the evening ruling out dining on 
		the beach so ate while watching Arsenal v Spurs in a slightly less 
		traditionally Thai restaurant.</p>

		3rd December 2006</font> </b>We were picked up from the hotel at 8 by 
		Wing Divers and driven to the dive centre at Bang Bao. We were given our 
		equipment and walked down to the pier to get on the boat. We had chosen 
		Wing Divers as they have a proper dive boat instead of the speed boats 
		that most companies here seem to use. The boat was fairly full but there 
		were only a few fun divers so it was not too crowded. It was only a 
		short journey out to the first dive site and we were in the water by 
		10:30. We dived on our own with a dive master called Ray,</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had not seen great reports about diving from Koh Chang so did not 
		really know what to expect. The first dive was nothing special, 
		particularly the first half of it although we did get to see a couple of 
		blue spotted stingrays. The second dive was far more spectacular, the 
		highlight being a huge school of juvenile barracuda that seemed to cover 
		half of the dive site. It was
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0490.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">probably 
		the biggest single school of fish we have ever seen and we spent ages 
		just watching them all swim around us. We also saw a school of about 20 
		- 30 squid and the dive site had a couple of narrow swim-throughs. A 
		very enjoyable dive!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the hotel by about 4:30. We had another unsuccessful 
		attempt to sort out hotels for later in the trip and started drinking 
		just after 6. We had a couple of beers on our balcony and then got 
		through a couple of bottles of Sang Som in a restaurant on the beach. We 
		did not drink that much but neither of us remember too much about 
		getting back to the hotel.</p>
