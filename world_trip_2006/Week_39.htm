		Monday, 
		5th March 2007</font> </b>Two more fun dives - the first in particular 
		was excellent. We sat down with David, the instructor here, between 
		dives and were given more of an idea of what we are going to be doing 
		for the next few weeks. We were also given a load of books to start 
		working our way through and were told to finish the &quot;assisting 
		instructors&quot; section by the end of the week due to the arrival of 19 
		Norwegian open water students on Friday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We moved to our new room after the second dive. It seems huge compared 
		to where we have moved from! We had wanted to do a night dive but there 
		was a shortage of torches so as DMT's we missed out.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Someone at the dive centre had organised a fish bar-b-q for the evening. 
		Just about everyone at Gapang, including staff and customers were there 
		- a total of about 15 - 20 people. The meal was OK and the evening as a 
		while quite enjoyable.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		6th March 2007</font> </b>Two more dives and the first time either Roz 
		or I had ever dived without the other one. At the first dive, I 
		accompanied David while he took Fleur and Wout for the deep dive from 
		their advanced course. Roz did a fun dive during which she saw a manta 
		and a turtle. For the afternoon dive, Roz accompanied the advanced class 
		for their navigation dive while I went out on the boat. I dived with 
		Daniel again and Luka plus two customers. There was strong currents on 
		the dive leading to a lot of confusion and us having to abort the dive 
		after 34 minutes. During the day we started working through our manuals 
		and made a start on the knowledge reviews.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We all for a &quot;pizza evening&quot; at Iboih, about 15 minutes drive away. It 
		was the same crowd as yesterday give or take a few different faces. 
		Excellent food but totally knackered by the end of the evening. Got back 
		to Gapang by about 10:30.</p>

		7th March 2007</font> </b>We were back diving together today as we both 
		accompanied Fleur and Wout with the last two dives of their advanced 
		course (Naturalist and Fish ID). We also had our first attempt at going 
		off on our own and diving the house reef outside the dive centre. This 
		did not go quite according to plan but we made it back safely and we did 
		have a green turtle to follow for a few minutes of the dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had our third organised evening meal in a row tonight (quite unusual 
		apparently) as it was Torsten and Silke's &quot;snorkel test&quot;. They have 
		recently become DM's and leave the day after tomorrow. The test itself 
		consisted of a can of lager being poured down a snorkel and appeared to 
		be a relatively easy part of the course! It was a pretty good meal (at 
		Ohana's) and an enjoyable evening. Nothing goes on too late here however 
		and we were still back in the room not long after 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Thursday, 
		8th March 2007</font> </b>Not too many customers today and the only boat 
		dive was to the deep wreck so it was a day spent mainly working through 
		the dive master manuals. We completed the sections that we were required 
		to get done before the arrival of the Norwegians and also got through 
		the first three of the eight &quot;final exams&quot;. We were working today with 
		Mette, the second of the two instructors here. The exams were fairly 
		straightforward but it was good to get at least some of the course 
		completed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		This all took up most of the day but we had finished by 4 so went out 
		for our second attempt at the house reef. Our navigation was slightly 
		better than it was yesterday and we managed to find one of the three 
		hawksbill turtles that lives on the reef. We sat around at the dive 
		centre for a couple of hours before heading back to our bungalow at 
		about 8. Finished a couple more knowledge reviews before going to bed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Fri</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		9th March 2007</font> </b>Two more dives today, both with Maria. Several 
		people left today including Torsten and Silve so the place seemed very 
		quiet. </p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0807.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Saturday, 
		10th March 2007</font> </b>Our busiest day here yet. We had 17 Dutch 
		snorkellers arrive at about 9:30. Three of them (2 Open Water) ended up 
		doing the morning dive. Roz and I had to help them all out underwater 
		and then lead two of the girls back to the boat when they were low on 
		air - our biggest responsibility yet! Roz's computer stopped working 
		today almost certainly due to me changing the battery yesterday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At about 2:30 the Norwegians arrived and most of the rest of the day was 
		spent assisting with getting them sorted out with their equipment and 
		paperwork, etc. Things were not helped by a power cut at 6pm and we did 
		not leave the dive centre until after 9. We ate at Limbo's with Maria and 
		were back in the room by 10 to listen to World Service.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 11th March 2007</font> </b>Another busy day. 
		Roz and I were both assisting different groups of Norwegian students. Me 
		and Luca were with David's two groups and Roz and Maria with Mette's. We 
		both assisted with the first confined water session and the first open 
		water dive for each of our two groups. </p>
