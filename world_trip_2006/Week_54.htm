		Monday, 18th June 2007</font> </b>A frustrating day trying without much 
		success to find ourselves another live-aboard. We had a couple that 
		seemed quite hopeful but were either full, not going due to not enough 
		people or just unsuitable for what we want. We had a text message from 
		Graham at about 12:15 but apart from that did not get much help all day. 
		After we had checked out of The Camel Hotel, Roz called the Bedouin Moon 
		in Dahab. They have rooms and seem quite happy to move our booking. They 
		also agreed to come and collect us at 4pm. Had lunch and spent an hour 
		by the pool but spent a lot of the afternoon looking for live-aboards.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were picked up by a minibus driver at 4:15 and were back at the 
		Bedouin Moon by 5:30. Got a room at the front of the hotel again but as 
		the place seemed fairly deserted, this was never going to be a problem. 
		We received and sent a couple more e-mails and finally had an e-mail 
		from Graham explaining his lack of help today and telling us that he 
		would try and find something for us tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked into Dahab for tea and had an excellent meal at our usual 
		place on the seafront before getting a taxi home.</p>

		We finally managed to start diving today. We turned up at the dive 
		centre after breakfast and it was good to see a few familiar faces 
		around - yesterday the whole place had seemed pretty dead. We did two 
		dives with Mark who we had dived with last year, at The Canyon and 
		Rick's Reef. Both very enjoyable and relaxing dives. Had my first 
		experience of a cleaner wrasse in my mouth at The Canyon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel by about 3 and we returned to trying to sort out our 
		live-aboard. We had a couple of e-mails about trips that we could go on 
		leaving on Saturday. Both are a bit more expensive than the one we were 
		originally booked on but seemed quite good options. We also had an 
		e-mail from Graham and he is trying to get us onto one of these for the 
		same price as it is operated by the same company as the one we were 
		booked onto. Also had a text about my job contract faxed over here for 
		me to sign. Not the most relaxing couple of days of the trip so far!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We did manage to get an hour or so by the pool in the late afternoon - 
		it is possible to sunbathe far later at the moment than it is in 
		September. We stared walking towards the seafront area again in the 
		evening and stopped at an Italian restaurant to eat.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Still nothing definite confirmed re the live-aboard!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 20th June 2007</font> </b>
		Another two dives &quot;Down South&quot;. Dived with a Dutch couple, Monique and 
		Boris. First dive we had not dived before and had a couple of nice 
		caves. The second was Golden Blocks which was OK but a site that we have 
		dived before and not been particularly impressed with.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel, there was still nothing from Graham. We sent him 
		another e-mail and eventually he did call us at the hotel&nbsp; It looks 
		as if he has managed to get us on a live-aboard for Saturday at last. It 
		also looks as if the boat we will be going on will be a lot better than 
		the one we were booked onto so things have not turned out too badly in 
		the end. Whether or not the upgrade will have been worth all the hassle 
		we have had to endure over the last few days remains to be seen.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Got a fax through from work with all the paperwork that I have to 
		complete and fax back. Hopefully this is also something that is coming 
		to an end.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We started on our Nitrox course in the evening. We were hoping that 
		there would be free Nitrox 
		on the live-aboard, so it finally seemed a good time to get it done. Roz 
		started on the book and we both watched the video before going for tea. 
		It was already 8ish by this time so we ate at the Bedouin Moon. They 
		still do a good chicken Balti!</p>

		Two good dives at the Blue Hole. First we dived from Bells to the Blue 
		Hole and on the second dive we did the right side. We were in quite a 
		big group today but we had asked to be able to do longer dives and 
		really ended up doing both dives with Adam. One drawback to diving with 
		Mabruk, the Egyptian DM is that he likes to drag the day out for as long 
		as possible. It takes about an hour from when we arrive at a dive site 
		until we get in the water, we have a 2 - 3 hour surface interval and sit 
		around having drinks in the restaurant after the second dive. Did not 
		get back to Reef 2000 until after 4.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got half way through our Nitrox course which is all pretty simple 
		coming as close as it does to the stuff we had to learn during DM 
		training. Had a few beers in the evening firstly on our balcony, a 
		couple in Adam's Bar on our way into Dahab and a couple more with our 
		meal. Quite pissed by the time we got our taxi home.</p>

		Another days diving Down South with Mabruk and two Dutch couples. Once 
		again we spent far too long killing time in the restaurant. The first 
		dive we went off on our own after 30 minutes due to the others having 
		worse air consumption than us. It was a bit of a confusing site to find 
		our way around but we sorted ourselves out eventually and got out at the 
		right place. The second dive we did with Adam again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the dive centre, we completed our Nitrox course and both passed 
		the exam without any problems. I finally managed to get all my details 
		e-mailed back to Ericsson something that has dragged on for most of this 
		week. Once all that was finished, we had a few beers again. A similar 
		evening to last night but instead of going for a meal, we got a few more 
		takeaway beers and bought kebabs to eat back on our balcony.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We had asked to spend less time away from the hotel today so did two 
		local dives. We came back after the first so had a couple of hours by 
		the pool and then went out again at 1 for the second. The second dive at 
		Islands was particularly enjoyable.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the second dive we checked out of our room and sat around waiting 
		for our transfer back to Sharm. After a bit of confusion about which 
		jetty we should be taken to, we eventually boarded Typhoon round about 
		7. It is a much better boat than anything we have been on before for a 
		live-aboard. There is loads of space, we have a decent size air-con 
		cabin and everything about the boat seems very luxurious compared to 
		some we have been on. We were the first guests on the boat so had a 
		couple of hours to sort out our equipment and generally look around. The 
		other guests (14 of them in total) had all arrived by 10 so we had our 
		welcome briefing followed by a late tea. Back in our cabin by 11:15.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 24th June 2007</font> </b>
		Woke up as the boat left Sharm just before 7. It was only a short 
		journey to the first dive site, Ras Katy where we all had to do a check 
		dive. There were fourteen other guests on the boat, all from England, 
		including a group of eight who all knew each other. We were split into 
		two groups, each group went with one of the two dive guides, Adam and 
		Tracey, also from England. The site was nothing spectacular but it was 
		an easy 40 minute dive to make sure everyone was happy with their 
		equipment, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_1503.jpg" width="272" height="204" align="right">After the first dive, we had a couple of hours journey down to Abu Nuhas. 
		The itinerary of the live-aboard we are on is entitled &quot;Brothers Wreck 
		Special&quot; meaning that not only do we travel down to The Brothers, we 
		also will be diving a lot of wrecks. We did two at Abu Nuhas, Carnatic 
		and Giannis D. Most of the divers on the boat were happy doing the dives 
		unguided but we started both dives with Tracey before finishing up on 
		our own. Both wrecks involved some penetration and we were both happier 
		entering the ships with someone who knew where they were going!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Both dives were very good with the second being the better of the two 
		due to the amount of the ship that was still intact and the fact that 
		there was more to see in the shallower parts of the dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was gone 7 by the time we finished the last dive. We had our evening 
		meal before the boat began the ten hour journey South to The Brothers. 
		Sat around in the lounge for an hour or so and had a relatively early 
		night.</p>
