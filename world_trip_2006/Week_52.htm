		Monday, 4th June 2007</font> </b>Got up at about 10 despite the fact 
		that it had been light since about an hour after we went to bed. We had 
		a trip out to a supermarket to buy food for breakfast and then I spent 
		the rest of the morning sorting out my CV. I applied for a contract 
		position at Ericsson by e-mail and got told by Andy that I should also 
		apply for a permanent position in another department.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_3901.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">The 
		old town of Tallinn seems a really nice place and we could not be much 
		better located right in the middle of it. Loads of medieval buildings 
		and good looking restaurants and bars. We met up with Mark and Sophie in 
		the main square and went for a walk around the old town before settling 
		in to The Beer House for the rest of the afternoon. We returned to the 
		apartment for showers and I had more e-mails regarding jobs from 
		Ericsson, the outcome of which will mean two phone calls tomorrow, one 
		regarding the permanent position and the other the contract job.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We all met up at 7 at The Beer Hose again for a drink before eating and 
		going for a drink in a Depeche Mode theme pub. We only had one drink 
		there before finding an excellent pub (Hell Hunt) where I spent the remainder of the 
		evening drinking Young's Double Chocolate Stout! A good day out without 
		anyone getting too pissed. Roz probably more drunk than me as I did not 
		want to be too hung-over for my phone calls tomorrow!</p>

		Had an e-mail from Christina saying that my phone call re the permanent 
		job would be tomorrow morning instead of today. Did speak to someone re 
		the contract position but that conversation was a bit of a waste of 
		time!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We met up with the others for the end of the Beer House's happy hour 
		just before 2. We had a drink there before heading off in our different 
		directions for more sightseeing. Roz and I walked around the castle area 
		and took in some of the view points of the old town before heading back 
		to the apartment. We met up with everyone again at 7ish and had a 
		similar evening to yesterday. We went for a meal and had a few drinks 
		before ending up at Hell Hunt again. All left just after midnight.</p>

		We met up with Mark and Steve at 11 and walked out to collect our match 
		tickets from the FA's hotel. This was all very straightforward and we 
		were back in the apartment before midday. I had my phone call from 
		Christina just after 1. 
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_1074.JPG" width="204" height="272" align="left"></b></font>The job on offer all sounded quite interesting 
		and I am fairly hopeful of being offered the job, hopefully without any 
		further interview!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We met up with the others in The Beer House again and spent most of the 
		rest of the afternoon drinking either in there or in Hell Hunt. The game 
		did not kick of until 9:30. We left Sophie in the pub at 7:30ish and 
		walked to the ground stopping for one more drink on the way. The game 
		was a very enjoyable experience compared to some trips. It was easy to 
		get in, we had good views, the game was OK to watch and we won 3 - 0. 
		Reasonably quick getting away from the ground after&nbsp; the final 
		whistle as well and we were back in the centre of Tallinn by midnight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had talked about going for another drink but everyone was knackered 
		by this stage so Mark and Steve came back to our apartment for half an 
		hour before returning to their hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Tallinn has been a superb place to visit. As well as the fact that the 
		football was good, it is a very attractive old town with plenty to see, 
		good beer and food, and excellent places to sit drinking. Definitely one 
		of the best England away trips.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 7th June 2007</font> </b>
		Left our apartment after breakfast and walked the two km out to the bus 
		station. We caught the 11:45 bus to Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa. 
		It was&nbsp; a four hour journey of which about 35 minutes was spent on 
		a ferry. This had seemed a good option as a place to spend a couple of 
		days en-route to Riga from where we fly home next week. However, as soon 
		as we arrived there just before 4pm, neither of us were overly 
		impressed. It was a nice enough place but no-where near as attractive as 
		we had both expected. We have seen a lot of far nicer medieval towns in 
		the last year! Also, the couple of hotels we tried were either full or 
		expensive for what we were getting and most of the bars/restaurants 
		seemed to be stretched out along a main road.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We checked into a hotel for the night and sent a few e-mails to hotels 
		in other places that we could go to for a couple of days.
		<font face="Times New Roman">We walked around the town and saw the main 
		sight, the not particularly impressive castle, before walking back to 
		the hotel via the bus station. We had not seen anything that made us 
		want to stay here longer than one night so booked bus tickets for the 
		7:45 bus to </font>P<font face="Times New Roman">ärnu tomorrow morning.
		</font>We will <font face="Times New Roman">probably stay there one 
		night there before heading for Latvia and a national park that looks 
		quite good. </font> </p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We ate in a pub type restaurant next to our 
		hotel and had an early night.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 8th June 2007</font> </b>We got up at 7 and 
		after grabbing a couple of rolls from breakfast, walked to the bus 
		station. We were on a large mini-bus for the three hour journey to P<font face="Times New Roman">ärnu 
		where we arrived at about 10:30. The hostel we had booked was just round 
		the corner from the bus station in </font>P<font face="Times New Roman">ärnu 
		and was the third place in a row that we have stayed in in Estonia with 
		free internet access in the room.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">
		We 
		went straight out for a walk around the town which was a lot nicer than 
		Kuressaare. We had hoped to spend the afternoon having &quot;mud treatment&quot;, 
		whatever that entailed, but the main mud baths was closed and did not 
		look like re-opening for quite some time. We wandered along the beach 
		which looked OK. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_3953.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">The water was not quite so appealing as at some of the 
		beaches we have been to recently but the beach-volleyball tournament 
		that was taking place was good to watch! We looked at a hotel that did 
		all the spa treatments but it all looked over priced and we decided that 
		we could not be bothered. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We walked back into the town and bought 
		lunch from a supermarket before returning to our room. We had planned to 
		go to the beach for the afternoon but after eating neither of us could 
		be bothered, not least because we did not have beach towels with us. 
		Spent the afternoon lying around in the room instead.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We went out for a couple of drinks at 5ish 
		before heading back to the room for a couple more. I drank two bottles 
		of A Le Coq Porter, the only Estonian beer on my beer list and was 
		fairly pissed by the time we went out to eat. We had a few more drinks 
		in a Russian Tavern type place and then went for a pizza that I only 
		vaguely remember. Got through two bottles of wine with the meal.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 9th June 2007</font> </b>
		Up at 8 for the 8:50 bus to Riga. It was a three hour journey, crossing 
		the border into Latvia after about an hour. In Riga, we got cash out and 
		got straight on to the 12:15 bus to Sigulda. We arrived in Sigulda at 
		about 1:30 and checked into the hotel we had booked which was just round 
		the corner from the bus station. We went out for lunch and then fell 
		asleep back at the hotel. At 4ish we made it out of the hotel and went 
		for a walk. We did not complete the planned route due to Roz being 
		bitten by insects but still managed to walk for a couple of hours.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the hotel by 6 and went out for an early tea - pizza 
		again but without the alcohol this time!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_1106.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		10th June 2007</font> </b>Spent the morning doing the longer of the two 
		walks that were recommended in our Sigulda walking guide. This was a 
		total of 10.5km and took just over three hours. We saw the main sights 
		of Sigulda at the end of this walk - old castle, new castle and Sigulda 
		church. Both walks we have done here have been OK without being too 
		spectacular. The same could probably be said about Sigulda itself!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate the remains of last nights pizza for lunch and did not really do 
		a lot for the rest of the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a change from pizza in the evening and ate in a cafeteria type place 
		near the hotel. Pretty good food with chocolate éclairs for dessert. 
		Back in the hotel by 8ish.</p>
