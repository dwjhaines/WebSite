		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 23rd October 2006</font> </b>We checked out of the hotel at 11 
		and returned to Best Camping to book another safari. We had decided on a 
		2<font face="Times New Roman">½ day trip to Amboseli just before we fly 
		home but ended up booking a 4 day trip that includes Tsavo West as well 
		for $480. This fits in better with our plans and means that we spend the 
		last night of our trip in a lodge. We got our photos backed up to CD 
		while in the office but later discovered that about 60 of my pictures 
		had somehow been deleted (from 2nd and third drives on Thursday)</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Killed time for the rest of the day waiting 
		for the evening train to Mombassa. We got a taxi to the station at 5:30 
		in time for the 7:00 train.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0391.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">The 
		train pulled in at 6:10 and we went straight to our cabin. We had paid 
		for first class tickets which meant that we had a two birth cabin to 
		ourselves. Our carriage had no electricity so we were all given torches 
		but otherwise it was all very comfortable. We departed at 7:20 and we 
		headed straight to the restaurant car for dinner. We shared a table with 
		Margaret and Angel - two ex-pats wives. The food was pretty good 
		although it was all served in quite a rush to ensure we vacated the 
		seats for the second sitting. All in all, a quite enjoyable experience.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">When we returned to our compartment, I 
		discovered that someone had stolen my torch and a packet of batteries. 
		This would almost certainly of happened while our luggage was stored at 
		the hotel during today.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Our beds had been made up while we were at 
		tea and we were both in bed by about 10:30.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 24th October 2006</font> </b>
		Up at 6 for breakfast after a bumpy night with what felt like frequent 
		emergency stops. The train pulled into Mombassa at 9:30, only 90 minutes 
		late - quite good from what we had been told previously.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		As soon as we were off the train, Mombassa seemed a more pleasant, laid 
		back city than Nairobi had been. We walked the mile to our hotel and 
		were given an excellent room. Lonely Planet had said that the hotel was 
		one of the best deals in Kenya and the room alone made staying in 
		Mombassa a second night seem like a good option.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went for an Indian thali meal for lunch which was also excellent and 
		made up our minds about staying a second night. We walked out to the 
		Scandinavian Express office and booked our ticket on the 8am bus to Dar 
		es Salaam on Thursday. Spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on 
		sleep and reading.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0422.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="right">For 
		tea, we walked a couple of blocks to an excellent curry house - one of 
		the best meals we have had in Kenya. Watched Chesterfield v West Ham in 
		our room before going to sleep.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 25th October 2006</font> </b>
		In the morning we did the walking tour of Mombassa's old town. Parts of 
		it were quite nice but it was nothing too spectacular. We did not bother 
		going into the Fort as&nbsp; it was ksh800.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had another thali for lunch and then got a minibus out to a handicraft 
		cooperative looking for souvenirs. It was quite interesting looking 
		around the area where a lot of the stuff was made but we ended up not 
		buying anything. Got a minibus back to the hotel for siestas.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate at the same Indian restaurant as last night - the food has 
		definitely been the highlight of Mombassa - and returned to the hotel 
		for more live (?) football (Coventry v Colchester for some reason)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 26th October 2006</font> </b>
		Breakfast at 7 followed by a short taxi ride to the Scandinavian Express 
		office for the 8 am bus to Dar es Salaam. The journey was 10 hours and 
		not too bad really. We crossed the border into Tanzania at about 10am 
		(another $50 each for a visa) and we arrived in Dar on time just before 
		6. We got a taxi to the Safari Inn via a cash-point and had much needed 
		showers before going out to eat. Another city where it is not really 
		safe to go wandering around after dark.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 27th October 2006</font> </b>We were woken at 
		1am when Dar's electricity went of and generators started up all over 
		the place. The noise was deafening but our hotel's generator did not 
		power fan or air-con so the room became hot as well - not ideal for 
		sleeping!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		When we eventually got up, we walked to the port to buy our ticket to 
		Zanzibar on the 12:30 ferry ($20 each). We then went to the Coastal 
		Aviation office to see what options we have for the week between 
		finishing our diving and starting our second safari.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the hotel and phoned up and booked a hotel on Zanzibar 
		using the &quot;Zantel&quot; SIM card that we had bought (calls to the UK about 
		12p a minute!).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We checked out and got a taxi to the port. The ferry journey was just 
		over three hours. Much of the journey was in heavy rain and we were 
		lucky with the seats that we got - half the seats in economy were 
		soaked. The rain was at its heaviest as we approached Stonetown and the 
		whole deck was soaked. We waited of the ferry for about 10 minutes after 
		we had docked until the rain eased. After getting our passports stamped 
		again, we were met by someone from our hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0432.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">After 
		checking in, we went for something to eat and then went for a walk 
		around Stonetown which was a far nicer place than anywhere we have 
		stayed before on this part of the trip. After showering, we went to 
		Mercury's for a meal and a few beers. It was the first decent place we 
		have found to drink since arriving in Kenya - we stayed there until our 
		money ran out and returned to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 28th October 2006</font> </b>We decided 
		against a &quot;spice tour&quot; and spent most of the day in Stonetown. We had 
		quite a few things to do before we head off to Nungwi tomorrow. We had 
		to take out Tshs1.2 million to pay for our diving. WE found out about 
		diving from Stonetown and more info about Pemba, Mafia and Arusha NP. It 
		looks as if our best option after Nungwi will be to spend a few days 
		back in Stonetown before flying to Tanga. However, we will not make any 
		decisions until we have seen what Nungwi is like. We continued our 
		souvenir shopping with plenty more wooden animals and a few other 
		things.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in the room to listen to the football on World Service 
		(Northampton 1, Swansea 0) and also had a choice of two live premiership 
		games on our tele. After the football we watched the end of England's 
		O.D.I. against W. Indies and went to Mercury's again. We had pizzas and 
		a couple of beers but an earlier night than yesterday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 29th October 2006</font> </b>We were picked up 
		by a minibus at 8 and driven North to Nungwi where we arrived at about 
		9:15. We were dropped off at Sensation Divers and met the owner. He 
		arranged for someone to take us round a few hotels before we chose where 
		to stay as his guest house was full. We ended up at Amaan Bungalows in a 
		decent room for $50 a night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We paid for the room and diving in advance getting rid of about $900 in 
		cash that we had been carrying around, and carried our luggage to our 
		bungalow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0489.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="right">We 
		had lunch on our balcony and then walked down to the beach which was 
		nicer than we had expected - nice sand, clear water, a few bars but not 
		too many people. Definitely one of the best we have ever been to! This 
		together with the fact that our room is good and cheaper than expected 
		means we will probably end up extending our stay in Nungwi.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the dive centre at 4 to find out what is happening 
		tomorrow and then walked out to an aquarium about a mile South of the 
		village. The aquarium is home to a family of about 14 hawksbill turtles 
		and we paid Tshs3000 each to see them being fed. Neither of us were 
		totally sure about how good this was for the turtles but they all seemed 
		well enough looked after and it was excellent being able to see so many 
		of them close up.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time we had walked back there was a really good sunset that we 
		watched from one of the beach bars. We had our evening meal in one of 
		the hotel's beach side restaurants and this probably further increased 
		the chances of us staying longer than planned.</p>
