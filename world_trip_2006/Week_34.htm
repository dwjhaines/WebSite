		Monday, 29th January 2007</font> </b>Another typical day of not doing a 
		lot. Roz wandered round a few hotels at Long Beach during the afternoon 
		but found that no-where is as good value as Kaw Kwang so we will 
		probably return here when we come back to Lanta next month. We walked 
		into Saladan again in the evening and ate at Lanta Seafood.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 30th January 2007</font> </b>
		Two dives at Koh Ha. Both dives pretty good again - the vis is a lot 
		better than at Christmas.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It looks as if our travel plans for the next few weeks may have to be 
		altered slightly. We had enquired about staying at Kaw Kwang from Feb 
		15th for another 9 nights but discovered that the whole place is full 
		for the second half of February. Not sure what we will do instead as the 
		other options at Lanta are not as good.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We decided that as we would not be returning to Kaw Kwang later in the 
		month, we would stay here another four nights before going up to Khao 
		Lak. We eventually established that a room is available and we move from 
		205 to 204 tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Another fairly quiet day. Spent time by the pool and went into Saladan 
		for lunch. While in Saladan, we booked another couple of days diving 
		with Lanta Diver for Friday and Saturday. I ran along the beach in the evening 
		before we started drinking again. We ate at Sunset with a couple of bottles of Sang Som.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 1st February 2007</font> </b>
		We were up for breakfast at about 8:30 and moved rooms immediately after 
		we had eaten. We spent the morning by the pool, and had lunch at Kaw 
		Kwang. I walked into Saladan in the afternoon only to get thrown out of 
		an internet cafe due to there being police on the island. 
		Not totally sure what was going on but all the internet places seemed to 
		be closing down and locking up in quite a panic. I spoke to one of the 
		police involved who told me it was something to do with copyright but it 
		should all be back to normal tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I ran along the beach again in the evening. Neither of us was 
		enthusiastic about going too far to eat so we had tea in Kaw Kwang and 
		had an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 2nd February 2007</font> </b>
		We had booked a trip to King Cruiser today which did not leave until 
		1:30. The trip included the dive at King Cruiser and a night-dive at Koh 
		Bida. We spent a couple of hours by the pool in the morning and were 
		picked up by Lanta Diver at 1:15. We arrived at King Cruiser at 4:30 
		only to find that the buoy lines had been removed. Due to the currents 
		it is not safe to dive here without the buoy lines so we had to divert 
		to Shark Point instead. This did not turn out too badly as this was a 
		really good dive. We dived with Tod, a Thai DM as Anjali had hit her head on 
		something and did not feel like diving. He had never dived the site 
		before (neither had just about anyone else on the boat except us) but 
		seemed to find his way round with no problems. Excellent coral and 
		plenty of fish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Anjali had recovered to lead us on the night dive. The dive was OK- 
		plenty of crabs - but probably the strongest currents we have 
		experienced on a night dive. We did not get back to Saladan until 11pm 
		and got back to Kaw Kwang at 11:15</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We had not realised that we would be back from King Cruiser so late when 
		we had booked two days diving but were collected again at 6:45 for a 
		trip to Hin Muang and Hin Daeng. Once again, it was too windy for us to 
		reach the dive sites we were aiming for so we did two dives at Koh Ha again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Both dives were pretty good 
		although we missed out on the whale sharks yet again. There was at least 
		one supposed to be in the area and we spent most of the second dive 
		looking &quot;into the blue&quot; but without any luck. Roz was obviously not 
		concentrating on looking for the whale shark as she managed to spot two 
		turtles instead!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_1131.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We were back at Kaw Kwang by mid afternoon so caught up on some sleep 
		before we started drinking again. A typical session - beers on the 
		balcony, a couple of bottles of Sang Som with our meal at Sunset and 
		back to the room for the end of the football. Could not really hear 
		World Service due to poor reception but vaguely remember seeing the end 
		of the Chelsea game before falling asleep.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 4th February 2007</font></b> 
		Our final day at Kaw Kwang. We will have spent 28 nights here by the 
		time we leave but will not be coming back here when we return to Lanta due 
		to it being fully booked.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent the morning by the pool and walked into Saladan at lunchtime. We 
		spent an hour or so on the internet before having lunch at Lanta Seafood 
		and walking&nbsp; back to Kaw Kwang. I wrapped up Roz's birthday 
		presents but did not do too much else for the rest of the day. I could 
		not be bothered to run along the beach but did manage a walk for the 
		sunset. Roz slept instead!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had tea in the Kaw Kwang restaurant for the final time and were back 
		in the room just after 9.</p>
