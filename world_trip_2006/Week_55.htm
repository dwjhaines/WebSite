		An excellent days diving at Big Brother Island, with slightly less 
		emphasis on wrecks! The first two dives of the day were supposed to be 
		wreck dives at The Namidia and Aida wrecks. At The Namidia, it was just 
		about impossible to stay on the wreck after being dropped near by due to 
		strong currents. We had a quick look at it but left almost immediately 
		and did the rest of the dive along a wall running the length of the 
		island. The second wreck started at about 30m so again, we went down for 
		a look but then did a drift dive along the wall. The third dive of the 
		day was a drift dive along the other side of the island. All three dives 
		were very enjoyable.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We started all three of the dives today with a guide but went our own 
		way fairly soon after the start. We are by no means the most experienced 
		divers on the boat but seem to be the only ones interested in doing hour 
		long dives. Most people seem to be spending about half as much time as 
		us in the water for some reason. So far the live-aboard has been pretty 
		good. We do not seem to have as much in common with the other divers as 
		on some trips but it is still quite an entertaining crowd. The diving 
		has been very good so far and the food has been excellent.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After eating, spent an hour or so putting photos through Photoshop.</p>

		Woken at 5:30 for the first dive of the day. The plan was for two 
		relatively early dives at Little Brother island before heading further 
		North again. The two dives were very good again. The first was a drift 
		dive around one side of the island. The second was supposed to be a 
		drift round the other side but we spent most of the dive swimming into a 
		slight current. Another reason for the early start was to increase the 
		chances of seeing sharks and we did see a couple including quite a large 
		oceanic white tip. The highlight of the second dive was a Napoleon 
		wrasse that came right up to us and swam along with us for a minute or 
		two.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left Brothers at midday and spent the first couple of hours watching 
		Finding Nemo in the lounge before catching up on some sleep. The journey 
		took just under five hours and we were back in the water by 5:15. For 
		this dive we had a choice of two small wrecks to visit. We chose the one 
		to the right of the boat while everyone else went the other way. Not the 
		most spectacular of wrecks but we were accompanied by three bat fish 
		wile we swam around it. We also did a night dive in the same spot but 
		stayed closer to the boat and did not reach either of the wrecks. Due to 
		the long days at the moment, did not get back from the night dive until 
		9:15. Just enough time for snacks before bed.</p>

		A bit of a lie in today - the first dive was just before 7. The first 
		dive was one of the best so far, the wreck of the Salem Express. This 
		was a passenger ship that sunk killing at least 500 people. It was still 
		in good condition, was at an ideal depth and we were the first divers 
		there again. It was quite an eerie experience swimming around the wreck, 
		looking through portholes into the cabins and entering the restaurant 
		area still with tables and chairs. There are still items of luggage 
		lying around on the sea bed near the wreck.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The second wreck was not so spectacular but a reasonable enough 
		dive. On the third, we only stayed on the wreck for 15 minutes before 
		swimming back towards the boat along the reef. Finally we had a night 
		dive which was better than average although I was not feeling 100% when 
		we went in the water. I had not been able to warm up all day and seemed 
		to be constantly cold whether in or out of the water. Got back from the 
		night dive, had plenty of hot drinks and bed by 11.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Not a good start to the day. We were diving the Rosalie Muller Wreck. 
		Once again Roz and I were the first ones on the wreck and it could have 
		been a very good dive. However, the top of the wreck is at about 30m so 
		even with Nitrox, we only had about 18 minutes bottom time. Due to poor 
		visibility, you could not see anything from higher up so we were back on 
		the boat after 28 minutes. As well as the fact that the dive was not 
		wonderful, my camera flooded on this dive. I tried taking a picture when 
		we were on the wreck and found that the housing was full of sea water. I 
		rinsed it and dried it out when we were back on the boat but the battery 
		is totally ruined and I have no idea whether or not it will ever work 
		again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_5585.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">After the disappointment of the first dive, the second was a lot better. 
		The wreck was a lot shallower and had a lot more fish on it. The wreck 
		itself was not that spectacular but the coral and fish made it all very 
		good to look at. Again, we were not on the wreck long before drifting 
		along the reef back towards the boat.. This was all very enjoyable and 
		made even better by the turtle that joined us for a 10 minute safety 
		stop.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The third and fourth dives were both on the Thistlegorm. Both were 
		excellent again. The first time we came to the Thistlegorm, there were 
		15 - 20 other dive boats on the site and the wreck was crowded with 
		divers. This time there was just one other boat and we went in as they 
		were coming out meaning we had the wreck to ourselves. In the afternoon 
		we went inside the wreck, past all the trucks and motor-bikes, etc. We 
		went back down to the wreck for our night dive and this was one of the 
		best night dives we have ever done. It was quite light due to the lights 
		from the two boats moored above the wreck and the full moon. There was 
		loads to see but the highlight was an encounter with our second turtle 
		of the day. It swan from behind us, hitting Roz on the shoulder and 
		almost bumping into me as it went past before swimming down to the lower 
		decks. Excellent end to a very good days diving.</p>

		live-aboard and two more excellent dives to end the trip. The first dive 
		of the day was at 6:45 on the Thistlegorm again. Roz and I were the 
		first in the water as usual and did not see another diver for the first 
		10 minutes of our dive. We did the deeper stern end of the wreck using 
		Nitrox but still managed to get a one hour dive in. The second dive was 
		at Shark and Yolanda Reefs. This was a superb dive with an excellent 
		reef, another very close encounter with a Napoleon wrasse and a few 
		minutes with another turtle at the end of the dive. A perfect way to 
		finish what has been a very good trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		From the last dive site, it was only about 45 minutes back to Sharm and 
		we were in the port just after midday. We had three hours on the boat 
		before being picked up so we could dry all our gear, say goodbye to the 
		crew, etc. The bus picked us up just after 3 and we then spent about an 
		hour going through security to get out of the port. The live-aboard 
		price included one night in a hotel in Sharm and we arrived at the hotel 
		at about 4:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_4035.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		spent an hour or so at the pool with most of the other divers from 
		Typhoon before going down for a walk around the shops. We met up with 
		everyone again in the evening and had a really good night out. We ate in 
		the hotel as the meal was included and then headed down to the Camel Bar 
		for a couple of hours. We all moved on to The Tavern at about 10 and 
		ended up staying there for about 5 hours getting totally wrecked. We 
		were drinking with the group from Cheltenham plus a few others and were 
		still in the pub when it closed at about 3, although this is a bit of a 
		vague memory.</p>

		Quite badly hung-over and knackered all day. We were picked up from 
		Sharm at midday after we had said our goodbyes to everyone. We were back 
		at the Bedouin Moon by 1:15 where we got a room at the front again. The 
		bad news was that the air-con was not working. When we arrived, we 
		thought it was just a bit weak but after it had been on a while, we 
		realised it was not working at all. We spent an hour or so by the pool 
		as the room was too hot to sleep in but were assured by the receptionist 
		(and the owner) that an engineer was on his way to resolve the problem. 
		When we returned from tea we were told that the engineer had not been 
		yet so had a fairly sleepless night in a very hot room. We later 
		discovered that the engineer had been and had not had the part required 
		to fix it!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 1st July 2007</font> </b>
		We were both awake at about 5 as we had the door and curtains open and 
		the sun was rising and already getting hot. Roz initially decided that 
		she was too tired to dive but changed her mind and did come along as 
		well in the end. At the dive centre spoke to Flo who assured us that we 
		would be able to move rooms when we returned from diving. This would 
		mean losing our sea view but would mean we had air-con again!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_5702.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We did two dives at the Canyon with Mabruk again, together with Rebecca 
		and Jane. Jane was doing a check dive on the first dive which was not 
		ideal but in the end it did not have too much effect on our dive. The 
		first dive was to the right of the Canyon along a wall we had not dived 
		before. The second was at the Canyon itself. On both dives, we were left 
		on our own after about 30 minutes as the others went back in due to 
		being low on air.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was a relatively early finish to the days diving for Mabruk and we 
		were back at the hotel by 3. We then had another argument with the hotel 
		staff because our room was not ready. We had to speak to Flo again and 
		he resolved things fairly quickly. We ended up in another sea view room 
		with assurances that we would not have to move again. Roz had a couple 
		of hours sleep while I walked into Dahab and got my hair cut.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a few beers in the evening - more than we intended to. We had a 
		couple on the balcony and then walked to Adam's Bar for a few more. 
		Quite pissed by the time we left there so got takeaways and a taxi back 
		to the hotel.</p>
