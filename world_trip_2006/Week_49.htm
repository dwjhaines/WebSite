		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Monday, 14th May 2007</font> </b>Returned to our room 
		after breakfast and did not get up until midday. We still had a few 
		things to buy before we go to Sulawesi tomorrow so spent a couple of 
		hours walking around shops. Included in this was a trip to DiveMasters 
		again to buy a replacement dive computer for Roz. Hers has been 
		resetting itself regularly since Pulau Weh and as we had the chance to 
		buy one cheaply ($275) decided now was the time to change it.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a couple of hours by the pool again before going out to complete 
		our shopping and to check e-mail, etc. In the evening we went out for a 
		meal with a couple who we had dived with yesterday, Chris and Ray. We 
		had met Ray in the bar we watched the football in last night and they 
		had phoned our room this morning to see if we wanted to join them 
		tonight. It was a more upmarket restaurant than we have been eating in 
		but the food was superb and well worth the extra money.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 15th May 2007</font> </b>
		We were up at 6:30 and were collected by a taxi after breakfast at 7:30. 
		We had an uneventful journey to Manado - two Garuda flights, the first 
		to Makassar on Sulawesi and the second taking us the rest of the way to 
		Manado. We arrived in Manado just after 1 and were met at the airport by 
		Rifke with whom Roz had been exchanging e-mails while we were at Sipidan. 
		We were taken by taxi to the port and then had a 40 minute boat journey 
		to Bunaken. On arrival, we filled out all the paperwork for the diving and spent the 
		rest of the afternoon on the balcony of our bungalow. All meals are 
		included in the price of the accommodation so we ate in the restaurant 
		here with the five other guests and had an early night.</p>

		Did three dives today. The boat went out after breakfast at 8 and we did 
		two dives. We then returned to Two Fishes and had lunch before going out 
		for the third dive of the day at 3. The diving was not as spectacular as 
		we had been expecting it to be but we did see quite a lot over the three 
		dives - two sharks, two turtles, a new species of sea-horse, plenty of 
		nudibranchs including ones we had not seen before and I saw an eagle ray 
		on the second dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The diving is well organised here. It is all done in small groups and we 
		have a guide to ourselves. They allow long dives as long as your air 
		lasts so we dived for well over three hours today. Also, there are not 
		too many people staying here but they still took out two boats today so 
		there is plenty of space in between dives.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		There is not a lot to do in between dives here but in a as with a 
		live-aboard, doing three dives seems to totally fill the day. We were 
		back in our bungalow by about 5:30 and by the time we had showered and 
		looked at pictures, it was time to go and eat again. Meals are at a 
		communal table with all other customers and so far have been reasonably 
		good. Were back in the room again by 9ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 17th May 2007</font> </b>
		Similar diving to yesterday. Three wall dives with plenty to see - ghost 
		pipe fish, Napoleon wrasse, leaf scorpion fish, shrimps, nudibranchs, 
		etc. the third dive had very strong down currents which were not much 
		fun.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		First two dives similar to the previous days. Both very good dives 
		again, especially the second where we spent about 10 minutes watching a 
		large green turtle move from its ledge to go up for air and then go back 
		to sleep again. The third dive was to Mandarin at sunset to see the 
		mandarin fish. This fish only comes out at sunset so we spent almost an 
		hour kneeling on broken coral trying to photograph them as they 
		appeared. A bit different form the other dives and quite amusing as we 
		both desperately tried to take pictures of fish that would not stay 
		still.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The dive ended in darkness and we were back at the resort by about 7. We 
		had a couple of drinks after eating as a DMT who had been here a while 
		is leaving tomorrow, but were still in bed by 11.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 19th May 2007</font> </b>
		Two more dives in the morning followed by a night dive at 6pm. Excellent 
		Napoleon wrasse on the first dive - probably the closest we have ever 
		got to one. The night dive was also very enjoyable. Spectacular crabs, 
		shrimps, etc and a white tip reef shark in a small cave right in front 
		of us.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At 10pm we interrupted the staff watching Titanic on the staff TV and 
		got them to turn over for the FA Cup final - a pretty unexciting game 
		that unfortunately went to extra time. Got to bed just before 1.</p>

		20th May 2007</font></b> A day trip to a couple of islands North of 
		Bunaken with three dives and lunch on the boat. It was an excellent days 
		diving. We started by going down to 43m looking for hammer heads. We did 
		not find any but did see another white tip swimming around. During the 
		day, we saw eagle rays, a turtle, a bump head parrot fish, sea-snakes, 
		loads of nudibranchs and the whole trip made a change from the wall 
		diving around Bunaken.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the resort by 5. The evening meal was a whole pig that 
		looked better than it tasted. </p>
