		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 1 - 7th June 2006</font> </b>We 
		left Kingsclere just after 7am and had an uneventful journey down to 
		Dover. We were booked on the
		<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6106.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">11:15 
		ferry but arrived just before 10 so managed to get on the 10:05. We 
		arrived in Calais at about 11:30 and drove into Belgium. We had planned 
		to go directly to Ypres but due to getting the earlier ferry, we had a 
		bit of extra time so stopped for a look around Veurne. Veurne is a small 
		town with a medieval square where we had our first beer of the trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">After a quick look around, we headed South for Ypres 
		with an unsuccessful search for a monastery/brewery on the way. We drove 
		into the impressive main square in
		<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6110.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right">Ipres 
		and found our way down to the B &amp; B that we had booked for two nights. 
		After parking we walked back to the square where we stopped for another 
		beer opposite the Lakenhalle (right) before walking out to the Menin 
		gate. We walked back to our hotel along the river and checked in.</p>
		<p align="justify">We went out in the evening looking for bars but a lot 
		of&nbsp; Ypres seemed to have shut down for the night by 18:00.
		<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6118.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">We 
		stopped in a fairly trendy place for a couple of beers and then wandered 
		around a load of places that were closed. We eventually found a slightly 
		downmarket place that had a &quot;promotion&quot; of bottles of Duvel for 2 euros. 
		Ended up staying there for a few hours and do not remember leaving!<br>

		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 2 - 8th June 2006</font></b> 
		Yesterday we had made enquiries about hiring bikes and had found that 
		our hotel had two that we could have for the day.&nbsp; After breakfast, 
		we set off on the<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6113.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left"> 
		Vredesroute (Peace Route). This is a 45 km bike ride around some of the 
		main sites of the Ipres Salient.
		<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6130.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right">The 
		trip took us about 5 hours. We saw several of the war cemeteries the 
		most spectacular being the Tyne Cot cemetery (right). Other notable ones 
		that we visited were the Buttes New British Cemetery and the Deutsher 
		Soldatenfriedhof (German Cemetery). Despite the fact that we were 
		touring round graveyards, it was a very enjoyable and interesting way of 
		spending the day.<p align="justify">Got back to the hotel by about 3 and 
		did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We went for a beer at Der 
		Posterie, the most famous pub in Ypres and made it to the Menin gate at 
		8 to watch the last post which is performed there every night. By the 
		time this was finished we were both totally worn out so got a couple of 
		kebabs and had an early night.<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 3 - 
		9th June 2006</font></b> 
		Left the hotel by about 8:30 and started the 330 mile dive to Mainz 
		where we were staying for England's first group game. We stopped a 
		couple of times, once for petrol, once for lunch and got into Mainz just 
		after 2pm. We met up with Mark at the hotel and went out to a bar to 
		watch the first game of the tournament - Germany v Costa Rica. After the 
		game, we spent the rest of the evening at the Augustiner Keller where we 
		met up with Steve and a couple of his friends who were over for the 
		England game.<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 4 - 10th June 2006</font></b> 
		Was up quite early so had a walk around Mainz before returning to the 
		hotel, waking up Roz and eating breakfast. We collected Steve and Mark 
		and all got the 11:06 train into Frankfurt. On arrival at Frankfurt Hbf, 
		we walked to an English pub,
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0065.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">The 
		Fox and Hound where we met up with Steve's friends again as well as 
		Mark's Crystal Palace mates. After a few beers, we departed for the 
		stadium just after 1. There had been a lot of confusion about our 
		tickets allocated by The FA and a lot of the others had bought tickets 
		from touts but by about 2:00, we were all safely in the ground.<p align="justify">
		Due to the ticket mix up, Roz and I were in a different part of the 
		ground to Mark and Steve. I think we had the better of the deal as we 
		had an excellent view from behind the goal.<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0089.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right"> 
		The atmosphere building up to kick-of was excellent and at 3pm we 
		finally got underway. The match was pretty crap overall but we put this 
		down to the heat which was incredible. The result was all that really 
		mattered so no-one was complaining too much about the quality of the 
		football but we are going to have to play a lot better to get anywhere in the 
		remainder of the tournament.<p align="justify">After the game Roz and I 
		got back into Frankfurt pretty quickly but then spent about an hour 
		waiting for everyone else to sort themselves out. We eventually gave up 
		waiting and headed off on our own to the Sachenhausen area of Frankfurt. 
		Here we went to a couple of traditional apfelwein houses and watched the 
		second game from our group. Both places were recommended by Lonely 
		Planet and were well worth the visit. Feeling quite light headed, we 
		eventually caught up with everyone else in another pub in Sachenhausen 
		to watch Argentina's first game. A couple more stops on the way home 
		completed a very enjoyable day. got back to the hotel by 2:30 am.<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 
		5 - 11th June 2006</font></b> 
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0104.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right">We said our goodbyes to Mark and Steve and left Mainz at midday and 
		started driving towards Kipfenberg, just South of Nurnberg, where we were 
		booked into our first campsite of the trip. The journey took us about 
		4.5 hours so were at the camp site by 4:30 ish. We found a spot to camp 
		and then spent about 45 minutes trying to put up our new tent for the 
		first time.&nbsp; By 5:15 Roz was able to stand up in it!<p align="justify">
		The camp site was ideal and even had a WM Studio for watching all the 
		games. After showering, we watched the second half of the 6pm game and 
		went into the square in the centre of Kipfenberg for a beer. There was a 
		pizza restaurant about 100m from the camp site so we went out for our 
		first proper meal of the trip. The temperature had dropped quite a lot 
		by the time we were back at the tent so we had no problems getting to 
		sleep.<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 
		6 - 12th June 2006</font></b> 
		The national park we are staying in is famous for its cycle paths so 
		after breakfast, we hired bikes and headed towards Eichstatt. The route 
		was fairly flat along the side of a river and Eichstatt was another very 
		pleasant town to visit. However, Roz's bike, in particular the saddle, 
		was causing her problems which spoilt the enjoyment of the trip. 
		Eventually, I did the last 10km on my own and went to collect her plus 
		bike with the car. We had intended to go back to the pizza place again 
		to eat but ended up watching the Italy game in a bar in the market place 
		while drinking more than we had planned. 
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;<b><font size="4">Day 
		7 - 13th June 2006</font></b> 
		Roz was not up to cycling anywhere today due to her injuries from 
		yesterday and it was too hot to do too much walking, so after an hour or 
		two lying in the sun, we drove down to have a look around Ingolstadd, 
		about 25km South of where we were staying. Another very nice city with a 
		couple of spectacular churches, castles, gates, etc to wonder round. 
		Spent the evening watching the football in the WM Studio at the campsite 
		but did make it out for a pizza again.<p align="center">
