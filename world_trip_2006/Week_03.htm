		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 15 - 21st June 2006</font> </b>
		After last nights result, we knew the path that England would have for 
		their remaining games in Germany so we spent some time in an internet 
		cafe while Roz cancelled hotels in the cities we will not be visiting.</p>
		<p align="justify">We checked out of our hotel and headed South along 
		towards Stuttgart. We travelled down the bank of the Rhine, stopping for 
		a two hour walk up to The Loreley from St Goarshausen, before continuing 
		to R<font face="Times New Roman">ü</font>desheim where we planned to camp for the night.</p>
		<p align="justify">Once at our campsite, we drank the wheat beer that we 
		had bought out to Germany with us and headed into the town to watch 
		Holland v Argentina.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Day 16 - 22nd June 2006</font> </b>
		Spent about 5 hours or so walking up to the Niederwald Denkmal, a large 
		monument on top of a hill and then along the top and down into 
		Assmannshausen, the next small town along the Rhine.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0329.JPG" width="154" height="205" align="left">Day 17 - 
		23rd June 2006 </b></font>We had a two hour drive to Stuttgart where we 
		arrived at around 1pm. Roz had signed up to work for the The Football 
		Supporters Federation (Free Lions) and they had provided us a room in a 
		hotel right next to the stadium. We met up with a couple of people from 
		FSF, picked up our tickets for the Ecuador game, and then went for a 
		look around Stuttgart. Roz met up with more people who she would be 
		working with while I wandered round some of the sights and we met up 
		again in the Paulaner beer hall for a drink before returning to the 
		hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">Kevin Miles from the FSF took everyone (about 15 
		people) out for a meal in the evening. I went along as well and somehow 
		managed to get volunteered into helping out as well for the next few 
		days.</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;<font size="4"><b>Day 18 - 24th June 2006 </b></font>
		We met up with the rest of the FSF lot at breakfast and were briefed by 
		Kevin about what we would be doing - mainly distributing Free Lions and 
		answering peoples questions. We were all given our &quot;Fans Embassy&quot; 
		t-shirts and everyone headed off into Stuttgart. I had to move the car 
		away from the stadium and find out about a ticket for Mark so followed 
		them in by about 11:30.<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0352.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right"></p>
		<p align="justify">I found Roz by the Fans Embassy and we spent the rest 
		of the day wandering around the city handing out Free Lions fanzines. It 
		was all quite enjoyable. We chose to go around the area containing some 
		of the nicer bars of Stuttgart, further away from the main station. Met 
		loads of people and were generally able to answer questions although we 
		never did find out where the Irish bar was! Once again, the city became 
		completely packed by mid afternoon due to the English fans and the 
		amount of Germans heading in to watch their game on the big screen. By 
		5:30 were worn out and had had enough of the crowds so Roz and I got a 
		train back to Bad Cannstatt the suburb where we were staying. We handed 
		out more fanzines and then stopped for a drink at a bar by the station 
		to watch the end of the German game.</p>
		<p align="justify">We were eventually joined by the rest of the FSF lot 
		and also by Steve and Kim who had come to collect their tickets. Kim had 
		flown out for the game only to find that she did not have a ticket due 
		to Steve getting confused about what game her voucher was for. She put 
		her (and Mark's) name on a waiting list for returns but at this point 
		was not too optimistic about seeing the game. Steve was not too popular! 
		We had a couple more drinks with them before returning to a beer garden 
		near the hotel to watch the Argentina v Mexico game.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		Day 19 - 25th June 2006 </b></font>Roz had suggested handing out Free 
		Lions at the camp site near the ground. We volunteered to do this and 
		together with Evan, another volunteer, were given 6 boxes (1500 copies) to distribute.<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0333.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left"> 
		We were quite keen to do this as it meant we would not have to go into 
		Stuttgart and could meet up with Mark, Steve, etc in Bad Cannstatt which 
		was walking distance from the ground. We based ourselves by a petrol 
		station and walked around not only the camp site (large car park!) but 
		the area around the ticket collection point. This worked out remarkably 
		well and we got rid of all fanzines within a couple of hours - far 
		easier than yesterday. We got a train into Stuttgart and returned in a 
		taxi to Bad Cannstatt station with another 2000 copies. We handed these 
		out to people at the station as the trains came in from Stuttgart and 
		spent most of&nbsp; the day directing people to the ticket collection 
		point. During the day, we were joined in Bad Cannstatt by Steve, Kim, 
		Mark and Dave who all now had tickets due to the Mark and Kim getting 
		tickets through the waiting list. We had got rid of all 2000 by 2:30 so 
		were able to join the others in a bar for a few pre-match drinks.</p>
		<p align="justify">We made our way to the ground at 4ish and were in our 
		seats with about 20 minutes to spare before the 17:00 kick-off. Another 
		poor game and bad performance by England but at the end of it we were in 
		the quarter finals. Hard to get too excited about it as it was such a 
		poor game but at least we are still in the competition and have got to 
		get better soon!</p>
		<p align="justify">Spent the rest of the evening drinking in the bar 
		back at Bad Cannstatt station where we were joined by Janet, who we had 
		met in Nuremburg and her friend, another Palace fan. Vaguely remember 
		going for a kebab at about 11:30.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		Day 20 - 26th June 2006 </b></font>We were supposed to work until 1pm 
		today but not a lot was happening in Stuttgart so we were allowed to 
		leave at about 11:30. Working for the FSF has been a pretty good 
		experience. Although it has been hard work in the heat, it has been very 
		enjoyable and something that we would definitely consider doing again in 
		the future. It has also been quite good financially as we have had our 
		accommodation paid for three nights, the meal on our first night, and 
		€30 expenses per day each for four days despite only really working for 
		two days.</p>
		<p align="justify">By the time we were back at the hotel, we were both 
		totally knackered. We had planned to drive up to about halfway to 
		Gelsenkirchen and camp for a couple of nights before driving the rest of 
		the way. However, we both agreed that we did not want to drive very far 
		and that we would also like a hotel room for a couple of nights. We 
		settled on W<font face="Times New Roman">ü</font>rzburg and hoped that 
		we would be able to find an Ibis where we could stay cheaply. We looked 
		at a few hotels before finding the Ibis and it was really good to have 
		an air-conditioned room with an en-suite bathroom for the first time in 
		a while. We watched the first of today's games in the hotel before going 
		out and watching the second in a beer garden in W<font face="Times New Roman">ü</font>rzburg.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		Day 21 - 27th June 2006 </b></font>We decided that we needed a day of 
		not doing very much.
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0364.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right">We 
		spent a couple of hours making use of the hotel's free internet access 
		before heading out on a walking tour of the old town. We had planned to 
		walk up to the big castle on the hill overlooking the town but it 
		started raining as we set out so started on a tour of the old town 
		instead. This proved to be quite lucky as it rained quite heavily after 
		we had been out for about 10 minutes. We spent about an hour sheltering 
		and having lunch before the rain cleared and we could continue the tour. 
		The sights were pretty spectacular, particularly The Residence.</p>
		<p align="justify">We watched the first football match of the day in our 
		room before going out for a couple of beers and a pizza.</p>
