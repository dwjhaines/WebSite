		We were up at 4 for the 11<font face="Times New Roman"> hour bus journey 
		to Kalaw. Our guesthouse gave us breakfast before leaving, we were 
		picked up by the bus at 4:30 and departed from Nyaung U at 5. The bus 
		was not particularly comfortable particularly towards the end of the 
		journey but it was an interesting enough journey and the day passed 
		fairly quickly.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We had considered staying on the bus 
		through to Inle Lake but by the time we reached Kalaw at 3:30, we were 
		both happy to get off. We will complete the last few hours of the 
		journey to Inle Lake tomorrow. We checked into a budget hotel which was 
		fairly basic but had an excellent balcony overlooking the whole town.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Kalaw is a bit of a backpacker centre 
		mainly as it is used for a base for trekking in the area, but there is 
		not too much to see and do in the town itself. We wandered round the 
		centre stopping for tea and pancakes at one of the tea shops before 
		returning to the room and sitting on the balcony until it got dark.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Due to its altitude, Kalaw is the coldest 
		place we have been to on this trip so far. We chose a restaurant based 
		on the fact that it looked warmer than our other choice, had a pretty 
		good curry again and were back in the room not long after 8. We were 
		both knackered after our early start and were asleep by 9.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">

		We had thought about getting a share taxi to Inle Lake via a set of 
		caves that had sounded reasonably interesting, but we found out that 
		there was a bus we could get at 7:45 and we took that option instead. The 
		bus arrived at Shwenyaung at about 9:30. From there a taxi took us and 
		the three other Westerners on the bus the 11km to Nyaungshwe. Nyaungshwe 
		is the main base for visiting the lake and is about 3km North of the 
		lake. The taxi took us round a couple of places and we eventually got a 
		room at the Bright Hotel for $18 a night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We made the most of the sun on our balcony for an hour or so and went 
		for a look around the town at about midday. Before going out, we booked 
		a boat trip round the lake for tomorrow. The town was nice enough 
		without having too much of interest to look at. We had lunch at a stall 
		in the market and then walked out to a monastery about a km North of the 
		town. Did not do a lot for the rest of the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out to an Italian restaurant for tea - once again chosen mainly 
		because it was reasonably warm. We both had tagliatelle with meatballs. 
		Not very Burmese but very good anyway.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We were served breakfast on our balcony at 8 and departed for our day 
		trip around Inle Lake at 8:30. We were joined by Matteus, who had been 
		on our bus and shared the taxi yesterday. We all walked down to the 
		jetty and boarded the boat, a long canoe type thing with a lawn-mower 
		engine stuck on the back. As well as the driver, there was a guide who 
		spoke reasonable English.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The lake itself was very scenic. We headed towards the Southern part of 
		the lake passing fishing boats many with the &quot;leg rowers&quot; that the lake 
		is famous for. We stopped at the floating garden and a fishing village 
		for pictures and continued on to the market at Nam Pan. This was an 
		excellent place with mainly fruit and vegetables being sold as well as 
		fish, meat, clothing, etc etc. There were a few other tourists around 
		but it was catering mainly for locals and was a very colourful and 
		interesting place to wander around.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left the market and visited a few very touristy places to view such 
		skills as silk weaving, cigar rolling and boat building before stopping 
		at a pagoda and visiting a restaurant for lunch. After lunch we visited 
		a silver-smiths but turned down the option of going to see umbrellas 
		being made. We chose to go to Indein which meant an enjoyable excursion 
		up a river from the lake and a 1km walk to another pagoda. The temple 
		itself was nothing special but the area was filled with ruined stupas 
		which made it worth visiting.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0994.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">There 
		were just two more places remaining to visit. Firstly we went to a 
		particularly 
		tacky tourist spot to photograph a few &quot;long-necked&quot; women who were 
		posing in traditional costume. None of us were particularly impressed 
		with this but we all got our photos! Our Inle Lake experience was completed at 
		the &quot;Jumping Cat Monastery&quot; where the monks have trained cats to jump 
		through hoops. The monastery itself was worth seeing and we did get to 
		see a few of the 25 cats that live there jumping through a hoop. The 
		cats all seemed very well looked after and the monks were all quite 
		friendly and keen to talk to us.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The whole trip had been excellent although I think that we enjoyed it 
		more than Matteus who found it all a bit too commercialised. Parts of it 
		were commercialised but the good parts more than made up for that. It 
		was also remarkably good value as the whole thing including tips for 
		driver and guide came to 18,000 Kyats or £2.50 each which seemed 
		ridiculously cheap considering the trip lasted over eight hours.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were a bit more adventurous with our evening meal tonight, visiting a 
		traditional Shan restaurant for a couple of curries with plenty of side 
		dishes some of which were more traditional than others. Back in the 
		hotel by 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Had breakfast on our balcony at 7 before getting into a taxi for the 1 
		hour drive to Heho airport. Our flight to Yangon was due to leave at 
		9:35 and eventually took off about an hour late. The flight took just 
		over an hour and by 12:45 we had checked back in to the Traders Hotel. 
		There was not too much left in Yangon that we still wanted to see so 
		spent most of the remainder of the afternoon by the pool.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At 4:30 we got a taxi out to Chaukhtatgyi Paya to see the huge reclining 
		Buddha. we walked from there to Kandawgyi Lake, hoping to see the 
		sunset. However, the walk to the lake took longer than we had expected 
		and we did not realise that you had to walk round to one of the official 
		entrances to get in. By the time we had got to the entrance, it was not 
		worth paying the entrance fee and camera fee so we got a taxi back to 
		the hotel instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate at the same restaurant that we had eaten in two weeks ago. We had 
		the same meal but both thought it was better than when we were here the 
		first time. We returned to the hotel and had our complimentary 
		(non-alcoholic) drink in 
		the lobby bar area before returning to the room by about 8:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Up at 8 for breakfast which was one of the best we have ever had. 
		Curries and Indian breads to start followed by French Bread and real 
		cheddar cheese! The range of food is superb and one of the reasons we 
		were keen to return to Traders.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After eating we went for a walk, firstly to the post office to send home 
		our postcards and then on to Botataung Paya, the only one of Yangon's 
		&quot;big three&quot; pagodas that we had not yet seen. The pagoda itself was 
		nothing spectacular after what we have seen in the last two weeks. 
		However, it had a pool of turtles that Roz could feed, keeping her entertained for about 20 
		minutes. It also featured something that resembled a fairground game for 
		donating money by throwing it at a Buddha in a moving glass case with a 
		metal bucket in front of it which was quite entertaining for its sheer 
		tackiness.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		This marked the end of our sight-seeing in Myanmar and we got a taxi 
		back to the hotel for a couple of hours by the pool. Did not do a lot 
		for the rest of the day. We had a few biscuits for lunch before 
		returning to the pool again. I spent over an hour in the gym in the 
		evening - it looks as if my toe is now 100% healed as I managed a 5km 
		run with no problems.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		On our previous visit to this hotel two weeks ago, Roz had completed a 
		customer service questionnaire and been rewarded with a US$14 voucher 
		which could be used in any of the hotels bars and restaurants. We had 
		another questionnaire put under our door today. I filled it in and we 
		got another voucher for the same amount meaning that we had $28 to 
		spend. We had a couple of beers in our room while watching a preview of 
		this weekends premiership games. before going down to eat.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The hotel restaurant has a &quot;theme night&quot; each evening and today's was an 
		Indian buffet for $16 each. We both had the buffet and a bottle of beer 
		which came to a total of $38 - almost as much as we had spent on all our 
		evening meals since getting to Myanmar ($48 in total for the previous 15 
		nights). With our vouchers, this came to 
		$10, still more than we have spent on any meal since getting here but 
		excellent value. There must of been 25 - 30 different meat, fish and 
		vegetable dishes as well as a selection of rice and Indian breads. When 
		we were both totally full of curry, especially the excellent prawn 
		curry, there was an equally impressive selection of desserts and 
		ice-cream. A very enjoyable way of spending our last evening here.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 20th January 2007</font> </b>
		Another excellent breakfast followed by a couple of hours by the pool 
		before checking out at 11:45. We got a taxi to the airport and departed 
		about 25 minutes late at 2:10, arriving in Bangkok at about 3:45, Thai 
		time (30 minutes ahead). It was a more eventful arrival than usual in 
		Bangkok. Firstly, the immigration officer only gave Roz a 30 day stay in 
		her passport instead of 60 days. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0613.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">There was a bit of an argument about 
		this before a supervisor resolved the issue. Then our taxi crashed into 
		another taxi before we had got out of the grounds of the airport. We 
		were not travelling with any great speed so there were no injuries but 
		we had to wait while a policeman went off to get us another taxi. By 
		5:15 we were checked back into the Asia Hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We both went out for about an hour - Roz to use the internet and catch 
		up on her e-mail while I began looking for birthday presents. I went to Panthip Plaza hoping that I would be able to find a camera and 
		underwater case for a reasonable price. I found two shops which sold the 
		Canon Ixy80, which is the equivalent of the Ixus65, together with the 
		underwater case for about Baht16,500 which seemed a pretty good deal - 
		less than I was expecting to pay. I wanted to check the reviews of the 
		camera before buying but just about decided that I would come back 
		tomorrow and buy the camera and case.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a 
		few drinks in the room after showering and stayed in the room for the 
		first half of the Liverpool v Chelsea game. We decided not to go to our 
		usual restaurant for tea but went to a place just round the corner that 
		was showing the second half. We got through a bottle of Sang Som with 
		our meal and then returned to the room for another while watching Spurs 
		v Fulham and listening to World Service (Swansea 0, Forest 0). Don't 
		really remember final score too clearly! </p>
		<p align="justify">
		Regan and Annette arrived in Bangkok on their way home from New Zealand 
		and checked into the hotel at about 10:30. They did not join us for a 
		drink due to being too tired!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 21st January 2007</font> </b>
		Woke early and could not get back to sleep, probably due to too much 
		diet coke yesterday evening. We got up at about 9 and went to McDonald's 
		for breakfast. Neither of us was too badly hung-over although I was not 
		feeling 100% for most of the day. Roz went to the pool while I went to 
		Panthip Plaza. I went onto the internet and checked the camera which all 
		seemed OK. I returned to one of the shops I had been to yesterday and 
		managed to get camera and underwater case for Baht16,200 with a 1GB memory card and 
		a case for my camera thrown in as well. I had not really expected to get 
		this so easily so was very pleased with my purchases. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2858.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">I 
		had also been considering upgrading the 
		laptop's hard drive - something about which I remained undecided but did 
		not actually do anything about. The effects of last nights Sang Som made 
		this decision a bit too difficult to make!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We met Regan and Annette for lunch in the MBK food centre, did some more 
		shopping and returned to the hotel. We started drinking again at 6:30. 
		Regan and Annette came down to our room and we had a couple of beers 
		before going out to eat. We ate at Ban Khun Mae and then got a taxi back 
		to the place we ate in last night so we could watch Arsenal v Man Utd. 
		We were still there at about 1:30 and then returned to our room to 
		finish the Sang Som we had left over from yesterday. Only vaguely 
		remember the latter stages of the night.</p>
