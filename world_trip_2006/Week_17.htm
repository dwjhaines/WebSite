		Monday, 2nd October 2006</font> </b>Our last day of fun diving. We 
		headed &quot;Down South&quot; again with JP and Hywel for a more relaxing days 
		diving than when we were here with them last week. When we returned to 
		Dahab, we waited an hour or so and then did a night dive back at the 
		Lighthouse.</p>

		Dive 228: <font face="Times New Roman">Golden Blocks</font><br>
		Dive was led by Hywel. Saw plenty of large fan coral. Went down deep at 
		the start of the dive to look for &quot;bigger&quot; fish. Did not find much but 
		saw a large potato grouper at about 10m.</font></p>

		Another site that we had not dived before. Plenty of spectacular coral 
		again. Saw a couple of rays - a torpedo ray and a blue-spotted sting 
		ray. Also saw a red sea walkman</font></p>

		Dive 230: <font face="Times New Roman">Lighthouse</font><br>
		One of the best night dives we have ever done. Dived to the right of 
		lighthouse over the training area where we did a lot of our rescue 
		skills. Saw an octopus, four morays, a huge stone fish, dwarf lion fish, 
		cuttle fish and loads of strange looking coral that we had not seen 
		before.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time we had finished the night dive, washed our kit and had 
		showers it was 8:30 so we could not be bothered to walk into Dahab. 
		Instead, we joined Hywel, JP and Martin (who seems to be recovering) at 
		the pool for a few beers and another chicken balti. We took a couple 
		more bottles down to our balcony when everyone left and got to bed at 
		about 1am.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 3rd October 2006</font></b> 
		We checked out of the hotel at midday and walked into Dahab for lunch. 
		We had to get about £600 of Egyptian pounds out to pay for our diving 
		and then ate lunch at the restaurant by the Lighthouse again. We spent a 
		couple of hours by the pool before having showers. We then spent an hour 
		or so with JP and Hywel before our mini bus turned up to take us to 
		Sharm. We were dropped off at the airport at about 7:30, checked in and 
		waited for the 21:20 flight back to Gatwick. The plane left just about 
		on time and after a couple of glasses of wine and the meal, we managed 
		to sleep most of the way back.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 4th October 2006</font></b> 
		Arrived in Gatwick at 1:50am and after collecting our luggage and 
		waiting for the car, we were on our way an hour later. We drove directly 
		to Llansteffan stopping once at a service station for breakfast and once 
		at Tesco in Swansea to buy wine. Arrived in Llansteffan at about 7:30. 
		Managed to avoid falling asleep during the day but did not really do a 
		lot.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 5th October 2006</font></b> 
		Another day of not doing much. We were going to go into Carmarthen to do 
		some shopping but could not be bothered due to the rain. We did make it 
		in for a pizza in the evening with Mum, Jane and Ayla. Roz and I did not 
		go back to Llansteffan from there instead going straight to Cathy's 
		house in Swansea.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Fri</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 6th October 2006</font></b> 
		We got a taxi to the Commercial by 5ish, picking up Cathy from work on 
		the way. We were joined by Dave and had a few pints before going to the 
		Swansea v Tranmere game (0 - 0). We all returned to the Commercial after 
		the game, stayed there until 11:30 and then went for a curry in 
		Morriston. Got to bed by about 1:30.</p>

		Got up before 8 for the three and a half hour drive to Macclesfield. 
		After showers at Ed's, we got the train into Manchester arriving at The 
		Knott at the same time as Steve and Kim. Stayed in the pub until about 4 
		and got taxis to Old Trafford. A pretty poor game and a disappointing 
		result.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a couple of drinks on the way back to Manchester Piccadilly and 
		got a relatively early train (9:32) back to Macclesfield. Ended up 
		staying in a pub in Macc with Ed and Jim until gone 1.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 8th October 2006</font></b> 
		Left Ed's fairly late and eventually got to Nottingham at about 2pm. 
		Went out for a meal with Roz's Mum and John and was in bed by 9:30 due 
		to being totally knackered and having another early start tomorrow.</p>
