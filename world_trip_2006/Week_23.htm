		Monday, 13th November 2006</font> </b>We had breakfast at 7 and left the 
		campsite at 7:45. The site had been fine for a couple of nights. We did 
		eventually find a shower we could use and the setting had been 
		fantastic.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0773.JPG" width="267" height="201" align="left">We had to get to the park exit by 9:30 to join the convoy heading for 
		Tsavo West N.P. and did a game drive along the way. This was excellent! 
		We saw a family of lions with three cubs and 6 - 7 others in the 
		background. They were all quite a way from us but we had very good views 
		of them anyway. We saw a carcass near the lions being devoured by 
		vultures and returned to yesterday's buffalo to see the last of the meat 
		being picked off by hyenas.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It took a couple of hours to reach Tsavo West. As we approached the 
		park, we saw lots of giraffes close to the road. We stopped for pictures 
		of the Shetani Lava Flow and got to the park gate at about 11:40.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were driven to our lodge which was complete luxury compared to our 
		accommodation for the last two nights. We had a really nice room with 
		hot showers, electricity and a huge double bed. We had lunch in the 
		restaurant which had really good views of the surrounding hills and a 
		large watering hole. After lunch we spent an hour by the pool before the 
		afternoon game drive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0788.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">The 
		game drive was no-where near as good as the previous ones we have done. 
		We were taken to a pool with lots of submerged hippos which was not too 
		exciting and did not see too much else. The animals are harder to see at 
		Tsavo because of the amount of trees and bushes and there did not seem 
		to be many around (except plenty of dik-diks). By 6:30 we had given up 
		and returned to the lodge.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a beer while watching the first animals going to the watering 
		hole - mainly gazelles. After showers, we returned to the restaurant for 
		dinner - an excellent five course meal. By the end of the meal, we had 
		moved to a table at the front with a better view of the watering hole. 
		We stayed for a couple more beers while watching zebras. It was another 
		superb experience and a very nice way to end our last full day in 
		Africa.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 14th November 2006</font> </b>
		We were up by 6 for a 6:30 game drive. This turned out to be similar to 
		yesterday's. There were a few animals we had not seen before and plenty 
		of dik-diks again but it was not too exciting.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the lodge we had an excellent breakfast overlooking the watering 
		hole again. We had an hour in our room before checking out of the lodge 
		and beginning the drive back to Nairobi. The first hour was through the 
		park before we came to the main Mombassa - Nairobi road. It took a total 
		of about six hours to get back. The Germans got dropped off at the 
		airport. We continued back to the city centre to collect our $50 refund 
		from Best Camping. We went out to buy a few last minute 
		souvenirs/presents and spent some time on the internet before getting 
		driven back to the airport by Peter.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were at the airport just after 6 and were able to check-in almost 
		immediately despite the fact that our flight was not due to depart until 
		23:20.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We wandered round a few of the souvenir shops getting rid of most of our 
		remaining shillings and then sat in a bar getting rid of the rest. Quite 
		light-headed when we eventually got on the plane. We took off at 
		midnight and got quite pissed on wine before falling asleep.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 15th November 2006</font> </b>
		We landed on time at 5am, got our luggage quickly and were back at the 
		car by 6. We had five hours to kill before our flight to Amsterdam so 
		decided to drive to Farnborough to collect the laptop. We were back at 
		Heathrow by 9 and departed for Amsterdam just after 11. We were in 
		Schipol by 1ish and got the train into the centre. We met Mark at the 
		hotel and had a beer in the hotel bar while waiting for Steve who joined 
		us shortly after we arrived.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0883.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">We 
		spent the remainder of the afternoon in De Wildemaan. We had a very 
		enjoyable few hours in there before heading to the ground at 7. We made 
		it into our seats just before kick-off with no Zagreb style dramas at 
		the turnstiles. The game was nothing too exciting and finished 1 - 1. We 
		were back in the centre of Amsterdam fairly quickly after the game so 
		could spend another couple of hours in De Wildemaan until it closed at 
		1.</p>

		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 16th November 2006</font> </b>
		Uneventful journey back - train to Schipol, 11:40 flight back to 
		Heathrow, back to the car and en-route to Nottingham by about 12:15. 
		Spent night at Roz's mum's.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Friday, 17th November 2006</font> </b>Roz dropped me at Meadowhall on 
		her way up to Newcastle. I spent an hour or so there before getting fed 
		up and getting the bus into Sheffield. Managed to complete most of my 
		Christmas shopping before getting another bus out to Hoggy's. Went to 
		Butler's for a curry and then got pissed in Sheffield with Hoggy and Ed.</p>

		Hoggy drove to Port Vale where we saw Swansea win 2 - 0. We were joined 
		by Roz after the game and went for an Italian meal and a few pints in 
		the Sportsman.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Sunday, 19th November 2006</font> </b>Drove from Sheffield to Wheatley 
		where we got to see Harvey for the final time before we head off to 
		S.E.Asia. We went out for a couple of pints in the Railway before 
		returning to the house for a curry.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent the remainder of the evening getting pissed on a selection of 
		Belgium and German beers and got to bed at about 3am.</p>
