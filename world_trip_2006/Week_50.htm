		A return to the more normal schedule of two dives in the morning and one 
		at 3pm. The first dive was not as good as the others we have done here 
		mainly due to the amount of dead coral around most of the dive site. The 
		second was much better. For the third, Roz asked about going to see 
		turtles and we were taken to a site that gives the best chance for 
		seeing them. I managed to see seven turtles during the dive and Roz saw 
		eight in total. As well as the turtles, during the day there were more 
		sharks, bump-head parrot fish, nudibranchs, leaf scorpion fish, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Another quiet evening and we were back in the room by just after 9.</p>

		<b><font size="4">Tuesday, 22nd May 2007</font> </b>Our last day of 
		diving at Bunaken. We did the first two morning dives on the Sulawesi 
		mainland and returned to the same site as yesterday afternoon for the 
		third. Only saw three turtles this time but the dives were all very good 
		again. We had a couple of beers with the other guests before eating in 
		the evening. There have not been that many other people staying here 
		while we have been here, 4 - 10 other guests most of the time. We have 
		liked just about everyone here and it has been a good group of people to 
		dive with.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Two Fishes has been another excellent dive centre to dive with. The 
		customer service would be hard to beat, the owners and staff very 
		friendly, small dive groups and the diving itself has been excellent. 
		Another place that we will hopefully come back to!</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_1127.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Wednesday, 23rd May 2007</font> </b>We left Bunaken at 
		8:30 and were transferred to Two Fish's other resort at Lembeh. This 
		involved a boat back to Sulawesi, just over an hours car journey and a 
		10 minute boat ride across to Lembeh. We arrived at the Lembeh resort 
		just after 11 and went out for our first dive here 15 minutes later. The 
		diving here is &quot;muck diving&quot; - very different to the diving at Bunaken. 
		We dived at 11 and 3 and did a night dive at 6. All three dives were 
		very good with loads of stuff that we had not seen before. Lots of new 
		nudibranchs as well as all sorts of weird looking fish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The resort is not as big or as developed as the one at Bunaken but is 
		fine for a few nights. We ate with the only other couple who are staying 
		here at the moment and were in bed by about 10:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We got up at 2:45 to watch the Champions League final with all the male 
		staff from the resort. We returned to bed two hours later to get a bit 
		more sleep before starting another days diving.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Another three dives and almost four hours underwater again. All the 
		dives were very similar but once again there was loads to see. Every 
		time you think it is getting boring swimming over black sand, something 
		else appears that we have never seen before. We saw a total of eight 
		frog-fish during the day!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The Dutch couple that were here last night left after the second dive 
		leaving us as the only guests in the resort. We had tea at 6:45 and 
		after an hour or so looking at photos of the days diving with Vanus, our 
		guide, we had an early night.</p>

		Two more dives and loads more strange creatures including the hairy frog 
		fish. The first dive of the day was much the same as yesterdays with two 
		sea horses and the hairy frog fish. The second was a more normal sort of 
		dive along a coral slope but still with plenty to see including pygmy 
		sea-horses.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		This finished our diving for a few weeks. We could not do the afternoon 
		dive as we fly tomorrow at 1:40 and need a 24 hours between diving and 
		flying, particularly after the amount of repetitive dives we have done 
		in the last ten days (29). Did not do a lot for the rest of the 
		afternoon but did manage to dry off most of our dive equipment.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		During the day we were joined at the resort by Barbara who we knew from 
		Bunaken and Judi. We stayed up slightly later after eating but were 
		still back in the room by 9:30.</p>

		Left Lembeh at 8 and were taken back to the mainland on the dive boat. 
		We then had an hour or so in the car to get back to Manado and were 
		taken to the Two Fishes office to settle our bill. This involved a lot 
		of messing around as both of our cash-point cards appear to have been 
		blocked by Nationwide due to &quot;irregular transactions&quot;. We were taken to 
		a shopping mall for an hour or so before being collected and driven to 
		the airport. Two more uneventful flights and we arrived back in Bali on 
		time just before 6. We had booked three nights at Poppies and were met 
		at the airport by one of their drivers although we ended up travelling 
		to Kuta in a taxi.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The traffic on the way in to Kuta was terrible and the area we drove 
		through looked horrendous - big new hotels and shopping malls everywhere 
		- but when we were dropped off at Bemo Corner, not much of central Kuta 
		seemed to have changed. We checked into Poppies which was very nice. 
		Another really good room in pleasant gardens........ and free wifi!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We immediately went out to stock up on drinks and started on the alcohol 
		after showers at about 7:30. We had a couple of drinks in the room 
		before going out. The area where we used to do most of our drinking in 
		Kuta was also largely unchanged. The Bali Asi which always had the 
		cheapest beer was still there but with a different name. Our pizza 
		restaurant was still open and still did very good pizzas. We had a few 
		beers before during and after eating and were back in the room by about 
		midnight. Do not really remember getting to bed!</p>

		Did not do a lot all day apart from lying by the pool. We both had a 
		free massage included in the price of the room and we had these by the 
		pool at 4. Had a similar evening to yesterday with the same ending.</p>
