		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0810.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Monday, 
		12th March 2007</font> </b>Could not dive today due to the lack of 
		electricity meaning that tanks could not be filled. The electric went 
		off for seven hours on Friday evening and then went off again at 6pm on 
		Saturday. It returned for four hours on Sunday morning but the 
		compressor is electric and it has not been possible to get yesterdays 
		tanks refilled. We managed to get a few customers in the water with the 
		staff diving with partially used tanks but the Norwegians had to make do 
		with a day of theory.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We did not have much to do so continued our DM theory work and managed 
		to get the physics exam out of the way.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Marjan and Ton returned from Badah Aceh with a petrol compressor and 
		generator during the afternoon so we could start filling tanks again but 
		it was a slow process.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		During the afternoon, Roz decided that she had had enough of the whole 
		thing and wanted to give up the DM training and leave Pulau Weh. Their 
		have been a lot of things that have added up to her being pretty 
		miserable with everything. Last week, both her glasses and her computer 
		broke. Since Saturday, things have been pretty chaotic at the dive 
		centre and we seem to be spending more time trying to get together 
		enough BCD's and regs for everyone to dive than we have spent doing 
		anything else. Roz has been in Mette's group for teaching the Norwegians 
		- this means that everything has been done in Norwegian and she does not 
		know what is going on. Gapang is not the ideal place for us and the lack 
		of electricity makes it even worse. Restaurants are closing earlier than 
		usual, if they open at all, there is a water shortage at the dive centre 
		and our room is way too hot without a fan.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		She was going to speak to Marjan tonight to give up but eventually 
		decided to give it another 48.hours. (I am enjoying the course and am 
		keen on staying to complete the training!)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		13th March 2007</font> </b>Not a good day! Roz was getting more and more 
		fed up about not understanding what was going on while Mette was getting 
		her group ready, and when she was told that she would have to give up 
		the computer that she was borrowing, she left the dive centre having 
		decided to quit. She returned to the room while I went out with David's 
		two groups and Maria covered for her with Mette's two. She was very 
		upset about everything and wanted to leave Pulau Weh as soon as 
		possible.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Marjan came up to speak to her about while I was in the water but she 
		was almost 100% certain that she was going to leave. After a lot of 
		discussion through the day, she decided to wait until Monday before 
		making her decision. The diving should get better after the Norwegians 
		have left and life should generally get better when the electric 
		returns. We also swapped groups so that I will be assisting Mette and 
		she will change to be with David.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The diving was fairly boring today as I spent a total of about five 
		hours watching David's two groups go through almost the whole set of 
		confined water skills.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0813.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		14th March 2007</font> </b>Roz was a lot happier today. Being with David 
		and having everything explained in English made life a lot easier and 
		having the use of my computer also helped. I am now relying on borrowing 
		the shop computers and having to listen to a lot of Norwegian but will 
		probably cope!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Diving today was also easier as there were only a few skills before 
		following the groups on their second open water dives. All the students 
		are pretty good so there are no major problems to sort out.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The electricity came back on again for about six hours in the afternoon 
		and early evening, the restaurant next to the dive centre reopened and 
		Lumba Lumba received a new delivery of Diet Coke. Everything is looking 
		much better!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		15th March 2007</font> </b>Another busy day. We both did Open Water Dive 
		#3 with two different groups in the morning - I assisted Mette with her 
		two groups and Roz continued with David. In the afternoon, we went with 
		the Norwegians on the boat to Rubiah Sea Garden where 13 of them 
		completed their Open Water course. Maria and I went with Mette's groups 
		while Roz and Luca went with David's. Roz also went out with David on an 
		Advanced night dive.</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0816.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Friday, 
		16th March 2007</font> </b>The final day of the Norwegian groups stay 
		here. I did an OW #3 dive in the morning with four students who had not 
		managed to finish the course yet for whatever reason. After about 5 
		minutes of the dive, I had to take one of them back in as she was not 
		feeling well. Meanwhile, Roz managed to get a 70 minute dive at Batee 
		Takong! Of the 19 Norwegians who turned up for the OW<span lang="en-us"> 
		course, one did not start, two dropped out after the first day, one 
		could not complete the course because she was ill and 15 passed.</span></p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent a few hours sitting around the dive centre studying 
		physiology and then went for another fun dive from the beach (and 
		managed to find our way back without having to go to the surface).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		17th March 2007</font> </b>One of the worst days we have had since we 
		arrived here. The dive shop was busy due to it being a bank holiday 
		weekend and there were too many customers for the amount of equipment 
		again. People who had booked dives where being turned away and Roz, 
		Maria and myself were left to try and sort out the problems and deal 
		with angry customers as Ton and Marjan were in Banda Aceh. And the 
		electric went off again!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the evening we did have a very good meal cooked by one of the 
		customers before returning to the room to listen to World Service. We 
		also had a couple of glasses of Bacardi, the first alcohol we had 
		consumed in 18 days!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0822.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		18th March 2007</font> </b>Due to the number of problems we had 
		yesterday with people wanting to dive, we had decided to do three boat 
		trips today at 8:30, 11:30 and 3:00. The first two dives were OK but Roz 
		got the short straw with both of them and was fairly certain that she 
		would be leaving early. She had a short dive at the first site due to 
		one of her group being low on air. In the second she was in strong 
		currents with an inexperienced group who had quite a few problems. The 
		third dive was by far the best of the day but unfortunately she had had 
		enough by then and did not go.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At this point, Roz was 100% sure that she would be leaving early. 
		However, during the evening, everyone kept emphasising how unusual the 
		last 10 days had been and how it was going to be a lot better in the 
		coming days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Tonight was Maria's last night here so she completed her snorkel test at 
		the dive centre</p>
