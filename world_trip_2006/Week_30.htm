		Day 2007</font> </b>Not too bad hangovers despite the late night and not 
		remembering getting back last night. We got up for breakfast before 
		going back to bed for a couple of hours. We spent an hour or so sorting 
		out some of our stuff ready for tomorrow and took down our Christmas 
		lights before going for lunch at 2ish. Spent an hour or so by the pool 
		in the afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Regan and Annette came round to eat at Kaw Kwang in the evening. They 
		head off to New Zealand tomorrow and we will meet up with them again in 
		Bangkok in three weeks time. Were back in the room watching football by 
		9. Managed to stay awake for the early game but fell asleep during the 
		1st half of the second match at 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Had a couple of hours by the pool in the morning and at midday we 
		checked out of our room. We had been in the same room for 15 nights, the 
		longest we have stayed anywhere on the trip so far. The time has gone 
		very quickly here and it was quite sad to be leaving again despite the 
		fact that it is only three weeks until we return.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left a load of our belongings, including all the diving gear and 
		everything else that is not required for the next three weeks with 
		reception before checking out. We also left a lot of our unwanted 
		things, such as Christmas lights, for the cleaner, so were carrying 
		considerably less when we left than when we arrived. We were taken by 
		pick-up truck to the ferry pier for the 1:00 ferry to Phuket via Phi 
		Phi. The first ferry turned out to be an over-crowded speed boat which 
		was not particularly comfortable but did get us to Phi Phi in about 40 
		minutes. We got straight from that on to a ferry that left Phi Phi at 
		2:30 arriving at the pier in Phuket at 4:20. There was not too many 
		transport options from the pier so we walked the 3km into Phuket Town. 
		It was not too hot, we had a more reasonable amount of luggage for such 
		walks and my broken toe is a lot better than it was a few days ago so 
		the walk was not too bad. We checked into a guest house for B350 for the 
		night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By this time it was getting on for 6 o'clock. We had showers, and went 
		straight out to eat not far from our hotel. I phoned Dad on the way back 
		from eating but we were still back in the hotel by about 8 and asleep by 
		10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Wednesday, 3rd January 2007</font> </b>After 
		breakfast, we went for another walk around the town. We posted a parcel 
		back to the UK containing things we no longer need out here such as 
		Christmas decorations, an assortment of spare cables and a cuddly 
		snowman! We checked out of the hotel at 10:45 and walked to the bus 
		station and got the 11:30 bus to the airport.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It took about an hour to get to the airport. Despite our check-in only 
		taking a couple of minutes, the few people in front of us in the queue 
		seemed to take forever to sort themselves out. When we eventually had our 
		boarding passes, we went through to the departure lounge and to Burger 
		King for lunch. We did not have long to wait for our departure and we 
		took off 20 minutes late at about 2:15. We arrived in Bangkok at about 3:25. 
		At Bangkok airport we tried, without success, to find the Royal 
		Jordanian office and then got a taxi to our hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had booked a room at the Samran Place Hotel, just round the corner 
		from the Asia Hotel which is where we normally stay when we are in 
		Bangkok. The taxi driver had not heard of the hotel but with a 
		combination of phone calls to the hotel and us giving directions we got 
		there eventually. We had looked at rooms here when we were in Bangkok in 
		November. The rooms are just as good as at the Asia and it is about half 
		the price.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After checking in, we spent an hour or so using the internet, had 
		showers and headed out for tea. We bought a couple of things from the 
		MBK and then went to our usual restaurant in Siam Square.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Thursday, 4th January 2007</font> </b>We checked out 
		of our hotel at 8 and headed off with our luggage to the Royal Jordanian 
		office on Silom Road. This involved a rush hour journey on the sky train 
		with our rucksacks as we did not want to have to return to the hotel. We 
		got to the office just after it opened and were told that we could not 
		move our return flights to England to the date we wanted - 31st May - as 
		the flight was full. After a bit of indecision, we changed the date to 
		24th May which means that we will be back in England for the play-off 
		final in the unlikely event that either of our teams make it to Wembley. 
		We will have the option of giving up that flight and buying a one way 
		ticket from KL or Bali if we want to fly back on the 31st but we will 
		worry about that nearer the time!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0343.JPG" width="282" height="211" align="left">We 
		got a taxi to the airport for our midday flight to Yangon, Myanmar. We 
		had a couple of hours to kill at the new airport before boarding the 
		plane on time. The flight was uneventful and we landed in Myanmar just 
		before 1. Getting through immigration and customs was far smoother than 
		expected and we were in a taxi on our way to The Traders Hotel by 1:15.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The hotel was excellent and was one of those places that we felt out of 
		place in as soon as we walked into reception. It is owned by the 
		Shangri-La group and had everything you would expect from that chain 
		with a very grand looking reception area that we looked far too 
		under-dressed for. When we checked in, we were given an envelope 
		containing the airline tickets that we had booked via the internet from 
		Koh Chang.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After checking in and leaving our luggage in the room, we headed out to 
		change money and to begin our sight-seeing. There are no ATM's in 
		Myanmar and travellers cheques and credit cards are next to useless. We 
		have all our money in $US cash and have to change these on the black 
		market to get any sort of decent rate. We walked to the area suggested 
		by Lonely Planet and were approached by a few people. We were approached 
		by someone offering a better rate - in retrospect, a too much better 
		rate - and walked off to a shop to exchange $200. The first problem came 
		with the sheer number of notes that we were dealing with. One US$ equals 
		about 1250 Kyat. The highest note available is K1000 but the most common 
		note appears to be K500. It took us about 10 minutes to count and check 
		the amount of Kyat that we were being offered (260,000) while being 
		watched by several locals. At this point everything seemed to be in 
		order and we handed over our $200. The bloke doing the exchange then 
		tried to switch one of our $50 notes for a $1 note. We assume that he 
		was going to claim that we had only given him $151 and try and get $50 
		more from us.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0351.JPG" width="205" height="274" align="right">However, 
		I spotted what he had done and pointed out where he had tried to hide 
		the $50. He then backed out of the whole deal, claimed he only wanted 
		$100 notes and we gave him his money back while reclaiming ours. We knew 
		exactly how many dollars we had to start with so knew that we had not 
		lost anything but it was easy to see how this sort of scam could of 
		worked.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to where we had started from and went with another local 
		that approached us. We followed him to a shop which seemed a far safer 
		environment for the transaction and exchanged $100 for K122,500.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After we had sorted this out, we begun our walking tour of the city. We 
		were saving the main sight for tomorrow but wandered round some of the 
		places to visit near our hotel. The most spectacular was our first 
		pagoda of our visit, Sule Paya. We wandered round there for 15 minutes 
		or so and then walked round a few of the old colonial buildings in the 
		area. It was all quite interesting and appeared to be a bit of a cross 
		between Bangkok and some of the Indian cities we visited 16 years ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the hotel for showers and went out for an early tea. We 
		went to an Indian restaurant near our hotel and had thali meals for K775 
		each, less than 30p. Excellent food and the cheapest meal of the trip so 
		far. It had been a long day and we were back in the room by 8 and asleep 
		by 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0415.JPG" width="274" height="206" align="left">Fri</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		5th January 2007</font> </b>We were up at 6 so we could begin our 
		sightseeing early. We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel and got a 
		taxi out to Shwedagon Paya, the biggest and most famous pagoda in Yangon 
		and the most sacred Buddhist site in Myanmar. We arrived there at 7 and 
		climbed the covered steps to the main part of the pagoda. We stayed at the top 
		for about 1<font face="Times New Roman">½ hours. It was an incredible 
		site, one of the most spectacular places I have ever seen. It was more 
		impressive than the Grand Palace in Bangkok and a more enjoyable 
		experience as there was a fraction of the tourists that you get at 
		Thailand's major sites. We walked quite quickly round once and then took our 
		time going round again looking at everything in more detail. We got 
		given food at the same time as a monk we were talking to - neither of us 
		really knew what was going on - and managed to find our &quot;planetary 
		posts&quot;. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0424.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right"></b></font><font face="Times New Roman">Once we left the pagoda, we got a taxi to 
		where we thought the Yangon Airlines office was so we could re-confirm 
		tomorrows flights to Mandalay. When we got there, we found that it was 
		marked in the wrong place on the Lonely Planet map and we had a 20 
		minute walk back to the office that was probably only a 10 minute walk 
		from </font>Shwedagon Paya! In the office, on the 5th floor of an 
		otherwise deserted former bank, there was some confusion about what we 
		wanted. We asked to reconfirm our tickets and the woman got the 
		impression that we wanted to change the time of our flight. As we had 
		been booked onto the 6:15am departure for some reason, we were quite keen to change the 
		time and got moved to the 10:30 flight instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got another taxi back to the hotel and spent the remainder of the 
		morning by the pool. We went out for lunch at 1ish, changed another $100 
		at the same shop that we had used yesterday with no problems and then 
		visited the Bogyoke Aung San Market. This was quite a large market with 
		a lot of different shops but was nothing too spectacular. We returned to 
		the hotel and had another hour by the pool while it was still in 
		sunlight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out to a different restaurant to yesterday but had a similar 
		meal. Once again, it was an early night and we were back in the hotel by 
		8.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 
		6th January 2007</font> </b>One of the main reasons we had been keen to 
		move our flights was that it meant that we could have breakfast at the 
		hotel before leaving. Once again it was excellent with a huge range of 
		food including curries and the best bread we have had since leaving 
		home. After eating, we checked out of the hotel and got a taxi to the 
		airport. The airport was a bit on the basic side but check-in was far 
		quicker than the other ones this week, mainly due to the lack of any 
		sort of id check. We were in the departure lounge by 9:30 and started 
		boarding at 10. The plane was in the air by 10:25, five minutes before 
		the scheduled departure time. The flight took 90 minutes including a 10 
		minute stop at Heho.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At midday we arrived at Mandalay airport which is actually about 40 km 
		from Mandalay. We were not in a very good bargaining position with the 
		taxi drivers but managed to reduce the cost slightly by sharing a taxi 
		with a German couple. An hour later we had checked into The Mandalay 
		City Hotel, not quite the same standard as Traders had been but very 
		nice anyway. After lunch at a Chinese restaurant, we went to find out 
		about hiring bikes for tomorrow. We ended up hiring a couple straight 
		away that we could return tomorrow evening. They were not quite up to 
		the standard of bikes we had been hiring in Germany but at K4500 (less 
		than £2) for the two we could not really complain.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0153.JPG" width="271" height="204" align="left">We 
		returned to the hotel for an hour by the pool and then headed off to 
		climb Mandalay Hill. It was fortunate that we had got the bikes today as 
		the base of the hill was further away from our hotel than we had 
		thought. It was almost 4km to the steps leading up the hill.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		As we cycled round the moat, we were joined by Tonto (or something like 
		that) who said he wanted to join us walking up the hill to practice his 
		English. We were a bit sceptical at first but at the base of the steps 
		we were joined by other members of his English class who all seemed 
		genuine enough. It was a 30 - 40 minute climb to the top from where the 
		views were very good. The students stayed with us all the way up and 
		back down again and seemed genuinely pleased to be able to talk to us.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0157.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		cycled back to the hotel in the dark accompanied by two of our new 
		friends. We had showers and then went out to eat at the chapatti stand 
		just round the corner from our hotel. 
		It was an excellent place to eat with about 8 people involved in making 
		and cooking chapattis which were served with curries and dhal. We sat at 
		plastic tables and chairs on the pavement and had the best meal we have 
		had since getting to Myanmar. It was also our cheapest meal costing 
		K1100 (less than 50p) for two.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in the room to watch the FA Cup 3rd round coverage. We 
		watched Tamworth v Norwich and then Birmingham v Newcastle while 
		listening to World Service. A good night for Swansea winning 3 - 0 at 
		Sheffield United. We even had commentary of Leon Britton scoring the 
		third from the penalty spot!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 
		7th January 2007</font> </b>Another day of sight-seeing. We were up for 
		breakfast just after 6 and were on our bikes by 6:45. We cycled out to 
		Amarapura, about 11km South of Mandalay.
		<b><font size="4">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0486.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left"></font></b>The 
		main sight there is U Bein's Bridge, a 1.2km long teak footbridge across 
		a lake. We found the bridge by about 8 o'clock. The bridge itself was 
		not too spectacular but the surrounding scenery was excellent. We locked 
		up our bikes and walked across the bridge having arranged for a boat to 
		come and collect us from the other side. The walk across was very 
		pleasant with fishing boats all across the lake and pagodas glistening 
		in the sun in every direction.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At the other side, we visited Kyauktawgyi Paya before getting our boat 
		back. The boat journey back was better than we expected. We were taken 
		out to the middle of the lake to get a close-up look at a group of 
		fishermen pulling in their nets and also went under the bridge a couple 
		of times - all for K2000. We cycled back through Amarapura looking at 
		another couple of pagodas on the way. Everywhere we went the people were 
		incredibly friendly, waving to us and giving us directions whenever we 
		stopped to look at the map.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the hotel by midday and spent an hour or so by the pool 
		before going out to lunch. We stopped at the bike rental place and paid 
		to keep our bikes for tomorrow and then went to a Burmese restaurant for 
		our first attempt at the local food. The meal was OK but nothing to make 
		us keen to repeat the experience!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0530.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">After 
		eating, we cycled round the palace again to visit the a couple of 
		temples near the base of Mandalay Hill. Before going into the first, we 
		got taken for a cup of tea with a woman who seemed keen on being a guide 
		for our trip round the ancient cities in a couple of days time. We 
		declined her offer and visited Kuthodaw Paya followed by Sandamani Paya. Both were very 
		spectacular again despite the confusion about which one we were in 
		initially! We had a brief visit to Atamashi Kyaung, a monastery, before 
		things started closing for the evening and we returned to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the chapatti stand for tea and were joined by an American 
		who is staying near-by. Were back in the room just after 9 for the Man 
		United v Aston Villa game.</p>
