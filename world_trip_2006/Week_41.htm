		Monday, 19th March 2007</font> </b>The first dive of the day was very busy again 
		due to there still being a lot of people around following the long 
		weekend. Both Roz and I had short dives again due to members of our 
		group using their air very quickly. Things did get a lot better after 
		this however. Most of the people staying in Gapang headed back to Banda Aceh and the dive shop was quiet for the first time in ages. We both did 
		the afternoon dive with only two customers meaning we got longer dives 
		(and saw a turtle)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We also managed to pass the Physiology exam which was good news as I had 
		really struggled with this part of the studying. We cheated slightly to 
		get to get through the exam but did not feel too guilty about this as we 
		have not had a lot of time to revise in the last week or so.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		A relatively easy day. We both did the two boat trips - in the morning 
		we went to Batee Tokong and in the afternoon to Rubiah Sea Garden. The 
		first dive was one of the best we have done here - good vis and two 
		black tip reef sharks swimming around on the plateau. The second, we 
		dived on our own and got dragged away from the dive site by the current. 
		There was still plenty to see and we were fortunate that the current 
		turned and took us back to where we started. Everyone else on the boat 
		aborted their dives and got dropped somewhere else!</p>

		21st March 2007</font> </b>I decided that I was in need of a day off 
		diving as we have dived every day for the last 8 days. Roz kept going 
		and did both the boat trips again. In between the dives, we completed 
		the equipment exam so we are 75% of the way through the theory and the 
		hardest ones are certainly out of the way. Ten Indonesians started their 
		open water course today. So far we have not had any involvement with 
		them and hopefully that will continue. It is very nice not having a lot 
		to do and only having 2 - 4 customers to deal with is ideal.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left the dive centre relatively early this evening and went to eat up 
		the hill from our resort for a change. Returned to our room by 7:30 to 
		start revision for the next exam.</p>

		Two good dives today. We both dived separately at The Canyon and then on 
		our own again at Rubiah Sea Garden. Visibility at The Canyon was the 
		best since we arrived here. The water temperature, however, was the 
		lowest since getting here with most peoples computers showing 20<font face="Times New Roman">°c. 
		This was not a big problem on this dive as we were only in the water for 
		about 30 minutes. At Rubiah Sea Garden we were in for 59 minutes and 
		were completely frozen by the end of the dive partly due to being the 
		only people diving in shorties. This dive went far more to plan than the 
		one two days ago and we are both now confident that we could lead dives 
		here. We completed exam number 7 after the second dive - just one more 
		to go!</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Today was the last day of diving for Ralf 
		and Christian who have been diving here for the last two weeks and leave 
		in the morning. During the evening, Cedric and Dianne turned up. They 
		are our next door neighbours at Laguna and will be diving here for the 
		next month.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 23rd March 2007</font> </b>No boat trip today 
		as there were no customers apart from
		<font face="Times New Roman">Cedric and Dianne who were diving from the 
		beach. We got a few more things ticked off from our course. Firstly we 
		spent a few hours with David completing some of the twenty skills that 
		we are supposed to be able to perform to demonstration standard. This 
		all went pretty well although Roz is going to have to perform mask 
		removal and fin pivot again. Each skill is marked from 1 to 5 we have to 
		get at least 3 points for each skill except mask removal which must be a 
		4. We both got enough 4's and 5's to ensure that we just need 3's in the 
		remaining skills to get the total of 68 points that is required.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We spent the remainder of the afternoon 
		studying dive tables and the wheel and were able to complete our final 
		exam, both getting 100%. It was really good to have completed the theory 
		part of the course already and we should now have a bit more spare time 
		without having to be constantly studying.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Peter turned up in the evening to begin his 
		DM training.</font></p>

		We both did three dives today including our first attempt at guiding 
		customers. As it is the weekend, there were a few more people around but 
		it was nowhere near as busy as last weekend. The first dive was to Batee 
		Tokong which was a nice enough dive in a group of five led by Collet. 
		For the second at the Canyon, me and Roz were at the back of different 
		groups although it all got a bit messy after about 20 minutes when the 
		current picked up, with customers getting confused about which group 
		they should be in. During this dive, a few people, including Roz, saw a 
		mola mola or sun fish which is quite a rare sight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		For the third dive, Roz did her first guided dive while being supervised 
		by Mette. She led one student completing her 4th OW dive at Rubiah Sea 
		Garden. I led two customers at Arus Paleh. This was supposed to be under 
		the supervision of Collet but he disappeared with other customers 
		leaving me on my own with Daniel at the back. Both dives went OK without 
		any major incident.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We did not bother listening to the sport program on World Service but 
		did get up at 1:15 am to try and find somewhere showing Israel v 
		England. We knew of two places that may of been showing it but both were 
		closed so we were back in bed not long after 1:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 25th March 2007</font> </b>
		First dive was at 8:30. We were down to three customers due to the low 
		water temperature. We returned to the canyon in the hope that we would 
		see the mola mola again. Collet and Daniel saw it at 43m and Roz thought 
		she saw it from about 10m higher but I missed out again. Roz guided the 
		second dive to Rubiah Sea Garden with three customers including Anne who 
		had just finished open water.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Did not do a lot for the rest of the day apart from laze around the dive 
		centre. We ate at Mama Jungle's with Peter, 
		Mette and a few of our remaining customers.</p>
