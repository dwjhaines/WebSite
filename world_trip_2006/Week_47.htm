		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Monday, 30th April 2007</font> </b>We were up at 7:30 
		and after our final roti canai for breakfast, we began our journey to 
		Bali. Both of our colds seemed to have cleared up but Roz still had 
		problems with one of her ears and we were still both feeling tired 
		despite the amount of sleep we had had in Tawau.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got a taxi from the hotel to the airport at about 8:30 and checked in 
		for the Air Asia flight to KL. This left slightly early just before 
		10:30 and landed in KL by 1. We had a few hours to kill at the airport 
		which went fairly quickly - McDonalds, internet, postcards, duty free, 
		etc - and we departed on our second Air Asia flight of the day at about 
		5:30. This flight was also slightly early and we arrived on Bali at 
		7:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		were met at the airport by two taxis! Roz had made enquiries with a 
		couple of places to stay before booking one of them. However, both of 
		them turned up to collect us. After sorting out that confusion, I waited 
		in the car while Roz went to collect tickets from the Garuda office for 
		our flights to Sulawesi in two weeks time. We left the airport at about 
		8:40 and had a journey of just over two hours to get to our 
		accommodation at Amed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time we arrived in Amed, we were both totally knackered. The room 
		we had booked however, was excellent. It was huge, really nicely 
		decorated, had a fridge and a superb balcony. The balcony was also huge 
		with comfortable chairs, a platform area for lying down and was only a 
		couple of metres from the sea. We had quick showers in the outdoor 
		bathroom which was also very nice and were asleep by 11:30.</p>

		A very enjoyable day doing not very much except lazing around on our balcony. We 
		had breakfast served on the balcony when we got up at about 8:30 having 
		finally caught up on our sleep. We wandered over to Eco Divers which is 
		only a couple of hundred metres away and booked ourselves onto a trip to Tulamben for tomorrow. Roz had contacted them by e-mail and we are 
		getting good discounts as we are now dive masters. It is only going to 
		cost us US$45 each for two dives tomorrow which further increases the 
		chances of us staying here longer than the week we had originally 
		booked.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The area where we are staying is ideal for us. We are very happy with 
		the room, we are five minutes walk from the dive centre and there are a 
		few really nice restaurants within walking distance as well. You also 
		get excellent views of the three volcanoes Agung,&nbsp; Abang and Batur 
		from the beach and several places around the village.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After a lazy afternoon, we had a couple of drinks in the evening. We had 
		a couple of beers with our meal and then a couple more on the balcony. 
		We are just about back to full fitness!</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_3625.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 2nd May 2007</font> </b>
		Supposed to be picked up by Eco Divers at 8:30 but ended up walking down 
		there instead. We sorted out our equipment and headed off to Tulamben at 
		9. We did two dives at Tulamben. The first was at the Liberty wreck, a 
		dive we did just after completing open water in 2000. The second was a 
		wall dive a bit further along the beach. Although not quite up to the 
		standards of Sipidan, both dives were very good. On the way back from 
		Tulamben, our guide Gusty and Michelle, an instructor who had also been 
		guiding, had an accident on their moped and ended up with quite a few 
		nasty looking cuts. They were reasonably lucky to avoid more serious 
		injury but were still looking quite shaken when we left the dive centre.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had an hour or so back at our room before spending half the evening 
		sending a couple of e-mails. We walked for about an hour before finding 
		an internet cafe with a working computer and then had to wait for ages 
		for someone else who was using it. We did get confirmation of our trip 
		to Sulawesi and have hopefully confirmed our booking at Poppies for when 
		we return to Bali.</p>

		3rd May 2007</font> </b>Two local dives, diving from a small fishing 
		boat. Both dives very good again. Another lazy afternoon on our balcony. 
		Had a few drinks again in the evening. Ended up getting more pissed than 
		we had planned to but an enjoyable evening anyway.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 4th May 2007</font> </b>We returned to 
		Tulamben for another couple of dives. This time we dived about 3km North 
		of the Liberty at Kubu. Very relaxing dives with loads of small fish and 
		very pretty coral.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a similar evening to yesterday and drank a similar amount. We 
		decided during the evening that it may be a good idea to buy BCD's and 
		regulators in Bali before flying to Sulawesi. We have talked about 
		getting them at home before going to Egypt but it may be cheaper to buy 
		them here and we would save a further $125 each on the diving at Bunaken. 
		It certainly seemed a good idea after a few beers!</p>

		5th May 2007</font> </b>
		We did a repeat of the dives that we did here on Wednesday today, i.e. 
		one dive at the Liberty and the second at the Tulamben wall. We did the 
		dives without a guide today as both dives are fairly straightforward and 
		diving on our own reduces the cost to $40 each for two dives. Both dives 
		were very enjoyable particularly the first.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had planned a session for tonight while listening to the football. We 
		had a couple of drinks before going out to eat at Divers Cafe. A couple 
		more drinks with the meal and then we continued drinking while listening 
		to World Service. Swansea missed out on the play-offs by losing 3 - 6 at 
		home to Blackpool. Ended up very pissed and do not remember the latter 
		stages of the night.</p>
