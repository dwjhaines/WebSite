		Monday, 20th November 2006</font> </b>Drove down to Bognor (via 
		Kingsclere) for lunch with Dad and Doris. From Bognor we went back up to 
		Farnborough to stay at Alex and Andi's<font face="Times New Roman">. A 
		relatively early night but we still got through a few bottles of wine.</font></p>

		Left early to drive down to Swansea. We had to stop at the Thai 
		consulate in Cardiff to attempt to get Thai visas as we plan to have two 
		stays there of more than 30 days. This proved to be a remarkably easy 
		task and we left the consulate with our visas about 10 minutes after 
		turning up.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Stayed in Swansea with Cathy. Went to the Red Lion quiz with Dave. Ended 
		up quite pissed again.</p>

		Spent the morning recovering from the last few days and drove to 
		Llansteffan after lunch. Ate at Jane's but had a relatively quiet 
		evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 23rd November 2006</font> </b>
		Got the car MOT'd and completed the remainder of my Christmas shopping</p>

		Back down to Swansea to watch the Wolves v Sunderland game at Dave's 
		followed by a curry.</p>

		Christmas lunch at Mum's</p>

		Took Ayla to her first football match (Swansea 0 - Bristol City 0) which 
		she enjoyed more than we had expected. Said goodbye to Mum (who had 
		waited in the car) Jane and Ayla and then rejoined Cathy in The 
		Commercial. We had a few in there while watching Man United v Chelsea 
		before getting a taxi to The Potter's Wheel. Several more in there 
		before going for a curry. Don't really remember getting back to Cathy's</p>
