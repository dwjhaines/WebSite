		No-one really did anything for most of the day except lie by the pool, 
		eat on the balconies and play with the family of cat plus three kittens that spend a lot 
		of time with us.</p>
		<p align="justify">At 4:30, Roz&nbsp;Ed and I went to Murphy's bar to 
		watch Sunderland get their first points of the season live on Sky. The 
		bar was very expensive compared to where we have been drinking but had a 
		big TV showing the game and was air-conditioned so we could not really 
		complain. We 
		returned to our balcony for the best sunset since we have been here, 
		before heading off to Stani's Taverna for the third night in a row. We got 
		through a few litres of wine but it was a relatively quiet night as we 
		all leave Santorini tomorrow.</p>

		Another day where we did not really do a lot except sit on the balcony 
		or by the pool. Regan and Annette were the first to leave as they were 
		flying home via Athens (and Munich) at 12:50. Ed, Roz and I all checked 
		out and left our rooms at 12:00. Ed went for a walk, Roz and I spent the 
		afternoon by the pool. We all left Scirocco's just before 4pm and walked 
		to the bus station. We got the 4:30 bus to the new port where we said 
		goodbye to Ed and got on the 5:30 boat back to Paros. We were able to 
		stand outside at the back of the boat for our final spectacular 
		views of Santorini as we left.</p>
		<p align="justify">We have both really enjoyed Santorini and will 
		probably return. The views from where we have been staying will be hard 
		to beat and have made it well worth paying the €110 a night - more than 
		double what we have been paying everywhere else. We have not done too 
		much while here, but we have not got bored of just sitting on the 
		balcony watching the boats in the day time when there has always been a 
		large cruise liner moored beneath us and plenty of other activity. 
		Sitting watching the sunsets in the evening has been one of the most 
		enjoyable parts of our visit to Greece.</p>
		<p align="justify">We arrived in Paros just before 8 and were collected 
		by Mark again. We were taken to the same apartments as we stayed in 10 
		days ago but this time were not in one of the budget rooms. Today is the 
		first day of &quot;mid-season&quot; and for €40 we got a much nicer studio 
		apartment with the biggest balcony I think we have ever had. Not quite 
		the same views as we have had the last few nights but very nice all the 
		same. We had a couple of beers on the balcony and then went out for a 
		pizza. Neither of us felt like carrying on drinking so we were back in 
		the room by 11:30.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		30th August 2006</font> </b>Spent a couple of hours by the pool before 
		lunch. We walked into Parikia and got takeaway kebabs for lunch. On the 
		way back we found a supermarket selling gift-packs consisting of three 
		bottles of Paulaner wheat beer and a glass for less than €5. This seemed 
		a bargain after a couple of weeks of Greek beer so we bought one to 
		consume on our terrace.</p>
		<p align="justify">By the time we got back to our room, we had been 
		provided with sun-loungers so we spent the rest of the afternoon lying 
		on the terrace without having to walk all the way down to the pool. We 
		consumed the wheat beer on the terrace before going out to eat. We ate 
		in the place that we had drank the cheap wine in last time we were in 
		Paros and got through another couple of litres with our meal. Quite 
		pissed by the time we got back to our apartment.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0558.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		31st August 2006</font> </b>We checked out of the apartment at 11:30 and 
		had a 10 minute walk to the port. At 12:15, we boarded &quot;High Speed 2&quot; 
		for the three hour trip back to Piraeus, the end of our Greek island 
		hopping. We had a free business upgrade on this journey but it was not 
		the most enjoyable journey we have had. The sea was rough meaning that 
		we were an hour late arriving, the roof leaked and my seat got soaked 
		and the cabin seemed to contain loads of screaming children. However, by 
		4:30, we were back in Piraeus and we got the metro into the centre of 
		Athens. It was a 10 minute walk to the Novotel that we had reserved for 
		two nights.</p>
		<p align="justify">After checking in, we went out to the train station 
		to find out about our departure from Athens in two days time. After 
		queuing for about 30 minutes, we asked about couchettes for the 22:55 train 
		to Thessalonica on Saturday night, wanting to find out if any were 
		available and what other options we had. We were unsure about exactly 
		what we wanted to do on Saturday but the ticket seller just about made 
		up our minds for us by issuing tickets for two couchettes!</p>
		<p align="justify">We returned to the hotel for showers and then walked 
		back to the Monastiraki area where we stayed two weeks ago. We returned 
		to the restaurant where we got our takeaways from last time, this time 
		sitting down to eat. Excellent kebabs again!</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>

		<font size="4">1st September 2006</font></b> We were up reasonably early 
		to begin our sight-seeing. We went first to the Parliament building to 
		watch the changing of the guard. This proved to be highly amusing and 
		very much like something out of Monty Python. We spent most of the next 
		couple of hours following the Lonely Planet walking tour. We walked 
		through the National Garden to the Temple of Olympian Zeus. We bought a 
		€2 ticket to get in here, meaning that we were now committed to not 
		paying to get into the acropolis as an all-in-one ticket would have 
		worked out cheaper. It was reasonably interesting to wander around 
		before we continued on to Hadrian's Arch. From here, we entered the area 
		immediately below the acropolis and walked around the Northern edge of 
		it. This was all quite pleasant and gave some good views of Athens. 
		After a bit of debate, we left the walking tour and walked up Filopappos 
		Hill, just to the SW of the acropolis.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0786.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">This 
		proved to be a good move as the hill gave us excellent views of the 
		Parthenon as well as the rest of Athens and Piraeus.</p>
		<p align="justify">After taking many photos, we walked down again, 
		continued the walking tour as far as Monastiraki (more kebabs) and 
		returned to the hotel by 2. We spent a couple of hours by the pool and 
		headed out for tea at 8ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">We ate in the same kebab place again (after walking 
		through one of Athens not so pleasant&nbsp; areas). The food really is 
		excellent there - four souvlaki, grilled tomato and onion, all served on 
		pita bread for €7 - enough for both of us to be totally full. After 
		eating we walked around the Plaka area beneath the acropolis. This had 
		changed quite a lot since I was there 20 years ago and was surprisingly 
		enjoyable. We had a drink in one really nice bar and then started 
		walking back to the hotel. Up to this point it had been a really good 
		evening. However, on the way back, Roz stopped to phone her mum. For the 
		second time in three weeks we received bad news that was to cause us to 
		change our plans. Aunty Marjorie had died yesterday morning and the 
		funeral is to be next Thursday. Roz would need to go home earlier than 
		planned to drive her mum up to Newcastle. This also meant that she would 
		miss England's game in Macedonia on Wednesday.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Saturday, 2nd</b></font><b><font size="4"> September 2006</font></b> 
		After last night's news, we were both awake early and started to look 
		for options for Roz to fly home for the funeral. We had internet access 
		in the room so could look at flights assuming that Roz would continue to 
		Skopje as planned and try and fly home on Wednesday morning. At 9 we 
		went out and visited a couple of travel agents and also the Olympic 
		Airlines office as we have flights booked back to London from 
		Thessaloniki on Friday morning. When we returned to the hotel, we 
		checked the englandfans web site and found that Roz would not be able to 
		register with them to prove she had been to the game until Wednesday, 
		making it fairly pointless for her to go to Skopje at all.</p>
		<p align="justify">Olympic were fairly generous with allowing her to 
		change her existing ticket which gave Roz the option of getting a flight 
		from Athens back to LHR on Wednesday morning for about €35. This was by 
		far the cheapest option and the one we eventually chose. This meant that 
		we would cancel our planned trip to Lake Ohrid and head out to another 
		island for three days instead. We phoned the hotel in Andros that both 
		Hoggy and Dave had stayed in during the last couple of weeks and managed 
		to get a room for three nights. Once we found that the room was 
		available, our minds were made up and the decision confirmed.</p>
		<p align="justify">By the time we had sorted out what we were going to 
		do, it was time to check-out of our room. We left our bags at the hotel 
		and went to sort out our respective tickets. Roz went to Olympic again 
		and changed her ticket so she could fly back to London from Athens on 
		Wednesday. By the time she got there the price had gone up to €75 but it was 
		still the cheapest option. I went to the railway station and cancelled 
		Roz's ticket to Thessaloniki (full refund except €1) and changed my 
		couchette reservation to Tuesday night (no charge) meaning that I would 
		arrive in Skopje at about 11am on the day of the England game. We met 
		back in the hotel and booked Roz's hire car using the internet access we 
		still had.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0814.JPG" width="195" height="260" align="left">Once 
		everything was sorted out, we collected our bags, walked to the bus 
		station and got a bus out to Rafina, from where the ferries to Andros 
		depart. We had a two hour wait for the 5:30 ferry and after making a 
		couple of phone calls, sat in a taverna by the port for a couple of much 
		needed beers. Towards the end of the two hour ferry journey, we sat on 
		the deck listening to first half commentary of England's game against 
		Andorra. After we got off the ferry, we got straight onto the bus for 
		Batsi, where we are staying and we were at our hotel just after 8.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had another room with a balcony with an excellent 
		view, overlooking the beach which is just across the road from the 
		hotel. We had a couple of bottles of retsina on the balcony before going 
		out and then got drunk on white wine in the restaurant where we ate. We 
		had another glass on the balcony when we got back and got to bed at 
		about 2. An enjoyable end to the day!</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Sunday, 3rd</b></font><b><font size="4"> September 2006</font></b> 
		A more relaxing day than yesterday! We were quite late waking up and 
		both had slight hangovers. We had cheese pies on the balcony for 
		breakfast and spent an hour or two by the pool in before going for a 
		walk around Batsi. This is probably the nicest place we have stayed in 
		Greece with the exception of Santorini. As well as being a nice village 
		with an excellent beach, the temperature is a lot lower than it has been 
		(long trousers required in the evening for the first time in ages) 
		and there are fewer people around - the high season is definitely over.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had gyros for lunch and spent the remainder of the 
		afternoon on the beach opposite our hotel. We finished off the litre and 
		a half bottle of wine that we bought last night before going out to eat 
		and managed to get through another two and a half litres in the 
		restaurant. Don't remember too much about getting back to the room!</p>
