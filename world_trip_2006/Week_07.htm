		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Monday,
		24th July 2006</font> </b>A day spent almost entirely on buses. We got 
		the 8:45 from Rovinj to Rijeka getting in at about 12:10 and then 
		straight onto another at 12:30 taking us down the coast to Zadar where 
		we arrived slightly earlier than expected at 5:15. The journey was not 
		too bad as the scenery was pretty spectacular most of the way down. We 
		had expected problems finding accommodation in Zadar's old town and 
		there were not too many options, but an agency found us a room for about 
		£24. It was not ideal but was OK for one night. We walked round the old 
		town which was pleasant enough and had a meal involving neither alcohol 
		or pizzas. We had returned to our room when we decided that we may be 
		better off getting an early bus tomorrow so I went back to the agency we 
		had used before and got two tickets for tomorrow's 7 am bus to Trogir.</p>
		<p align="justify">The room turned out to be one of the worst we had 
		stayed in - either too hot or too noisy depending on the window being 
		open or closed. Did not sleep well.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day,
		25th July 2006</font> </b>We got up at 6 and walked to the bus station 
		to get on the 7am bus. We arrived in Trogir about three hours later. 
		This was another place that we did not have any accommodation booked for 
		despite our attempts to get something sorted out on the internet. We 
		were not sure what we wanted to do but eventually, an agency found us a 
		&quot;studio apartment&quot;, about 1500m from Trogir (and 100m up a steep hill 
		from a beach) on another island called <font face="Times New Roman">
		&#268;iovo</font>. We were collected by the owner of the apartment from the 
		agency and driven back to the apartment. The room was ideal for a couple of days with a nice terrace and 
		was handy for shop, restaurant etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">We did not bother going back to see Trogir's sights 
		but had a lazy day with a couple of hours on the beach in the afternoon 
		and an evening meal in the nearby restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Europe_0082.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left"><font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day,
		26th July 2006</font> </b>We had breakfast on our terrace before walking 
		the 1500m back to have a look around Trogir. It was another very nice 
		place, the entire island consisting of the old town. We went into the 
		cathedral and up the tower for good views off the whole island as well 
		as <font face="Times New Roman">&#268;iovo. We spent another hour or so 
		wandering around the town before heading back to the apartment. Another 
		afternoon of not doing a lot. I went down to the beach for a swim but 
		apart from that, we spent the whole afternoon on the terrace outside our 
		apartment. Ate in the same place as yesterday.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day,
		27th July 2006</font> </b>We were given a lift back to Trogir by the 
		apartment owner and just got there in time to get the 7:40 bus to Split. 
		The journey took an hour and we headed down to the port area. We bought 
		tickets for the 10pm ferry to Vela Luka
		<img border="0" src="Photos/IMG_6475.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right" alt="" longdesc="Vela Luka harbour">on 
		Kor<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>ula and were on the ferry by about 9:45. The ferry journey was quite 
		enjoyable stopping in the centre of Hvar&nbsp; on the way. We were in 
		Vela Luka by about 1:40 and then had a 30 minute wait for the water taxi 
		across to Croatia Divers on the other side of the bay.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It took a couple of hours to get ourselves sorted out at Croatia Divers. 
		We had to fill in all the paperwork and then try on full length 5mm wet 
		suits. We were both given wet suits that were far too small for us so 
		this took some considerable time. We were eventually shown to our room, 
		just behind the dive shop, sometime after 4, having booked ourselves on 
		to dive trips for the next two days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked around the bay to the main part of Vela Luka in the evening 
		for our evening meal and a walk round the town which was another very 
		nice little place. Back in the room by about 10:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Day 5 with no 
		alcohol and feeling a lot better for it!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 28th July 2006</font> </b>We were not due to 
		dive until this afternoon so wandered into town again stopping to buy 
		breakfast from a supermarket on the way. We found out details of buses 
		for Sunday and had another look around and were at our room for 12:30. 
		Roz was feeling faint on the 
		way back and had to stop to sit down, but after lying in the room for 20 
		minutes, decided that she was OK to dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were at Croatia Divers by 1pm and after about an hour of messing 
		about, we were in our full length wet suits and boarded the &quot;rib&quot; to 
		take us to the dive sites. We dived the Blue Hole and one other site. We 
		both had problems getting under the water on the first dive and the boat 
		driver had to keep handing us more and more weight until we could sink. 
		I ended up diving with 12kg, 2kg of which I carried for the entire dive. 
		Getting into all our gear in thick wet suits on a crowded boat did not 
		help as we were not as relaxed as we should of been but we got there 
		eventually. The dive sites were both OK without being overly 
		spectacular. There was no comparison between diving here and in places 
		like the Red Sea or Thailand but it was still a reasonably enjoyable way 
		of spending the afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were booked on the morning dive trip for tomorrow so had a pizza and 
		an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Saturday,
		29th July 2006</font> </b>We arrived at the dive centre at 8am and then 
		sat around waiting for 2 hours. This was due mainly to the late arrival 
		of other divers but also a general lack of organisation. We did not have 
		too much else to do today so it was not too important but not the best 
		of starts to the day. When we finally did get to the dive sites, they 
		were once again quite enjoyable dives. The first through a series of 
		caves and the second was allegedly a drift dive but as there was no 
		current at all, this was not a wholly accurate description. We were both 
		pleased to have done the diving but would not rush back to dive here 
		again and would certainly not consider a holiday in Croatia specifically 
		for the diving.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Lightening_2.jpg" width="265" height="199" align="left"></font></b>By 
		the time we had got back to the dive centre and sorted out our gear, it 
		was almost 2pm. We walked round the bay and had lunch and did not do to 
		much else for the rest of the day. Roz spent an hour on the internet; I 
		spent most of the rest of the day lying in our room reading.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The weather the last few days has been getting increasingly hot and 
		humid. The rooms we have been staying in since leaving Rovinj, 
		particularly here in Vela Luka and the one in Zadar, have not been 
		designed for such temperatures so have been constantly too hot and 
		sleeping has been a problem. Tonight we finally had the storm which hopefully will clear the 
		air a bit. The was quite a lot of thunder and lightening in the distance 
		during the evening but it did not really reach us until about 3am. When 
		it did, it was one of the most spectacular displays of lightening I have 
		ever seen.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Sunday,
		29th July 2006</font> </b>We got the water taxi back across the bay in 
		time for the 10am bus to Kor<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>ula 
		Town. At mid day, we were collected from the Kor<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>ula 
		Town bus station by the son of the owners of the apartment we were 
		booked into in Lumbardo. The apartment is the nicest we have had in 
		Croatia with a kitchen and a terrace and great views of the sea and the 
		Croatian mainland. It is on a hill with plenty of windows so is 
		considerably cooler than other places we have stayed in the last week.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a walk around Lumbardo and then lunch on our terrace before 
		heading out to the beach. The beach is about 15 minutes walk from where 
		we are staying and is the first sandy beach we have had in Croatia.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the evening, after seven alcohol-free days, we started on the wine again. The family that own the 
		apartments (four generations of them) all live in the same place and are 
		very friendly. They had already given us half a litre of home made wine 
		and after we had finished that on our terrace, they bought us another. 
		They also seem quite keen on feeding us so we had some sort of deep 
		fried vegetable things to accompany our wine. We went out to the pizza 
		place recommended to us by Regan and got through another litre of wine 
		with our meal. We ended the evening with a few more glasses back at the 
		apartment. </p>
