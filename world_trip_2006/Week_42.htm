		Batee Tokong this morning. We were a bit unfortunate with the visibility 
		which was particularly poor. This made it a lot more difficult than it 
		should have been but we did at least make a start and know what we have 
		to do. We missed the afternoon dive as we were assisting with the 10 
		Indonesians who are all doing their open water.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent most of the evening working on our Emergency Assistance Plan. This 
		mainly involved copying and pasting bits from all the other plans that 
		previous students have completed but there did not seem too many other 
		ways of doing it.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Started taking antibiotics (doxy) on Mette's advice in an attempt to 
		heal the infected cuts on my legs. Some of these, I have had now for 
		nearly four weeks and they are showing no signs of healing.</p>

		Roz's day to be on &quot;shop duty&quot; so she did not dive. I went on the 
		morning boat trip to The Canyon where I did my first supervised guiding. 
		I led David and Peter and had to do the boat briefing, dive briefing as 
		well as lead the dive. All went reasonably successfully. Myself and Luca 
		assisted with the Indonesians in the afternoon while Roz was &quot;busy&quot; in 
		the shop. Another painfully boring hour that did not do my ear much 
		good.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Roz had to make an addition to our Emergency Assistance Plan while I was 
		with the Indonesians but we did get it signed off by David in the end. 
		Arranged to do our stamina test tomorrow. By the evening, Roz was fairly 
		sure she was going to fail this and not complete the DM course here.</p>

		Spent the morning completing our stamina test. We started off by marking 
		out a 100m course across the bay. Me Roz and Peter stretched out a 100m 
		tape measure and secured it by weight belts and surface marker buoys. 
		The three of us had to complete four tests - 100m tired diver tow, 15 
		minute float, 400m swim and 800m snorkel. All of the tasks were timed 
		with 1 - 5 points being awarded depending on the speed. We all pushed Ampon, the smallest member of the Indonesian staff here, for the tired 
		diver tow and all scored 4 points. The 15 minute float was an easy 5 
		points each leaving the two most difficult tests remaining. We all got 
		at least 2 points on the swimming meaning that we could take our time 
		over the snorkelling and just collect a point for completing the 
		distance. All passed first time without any problems despite Roz's 
		lack of optimism!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Today was my day on shop duty so I did not do a lot for the rest of the 
		day. Roz assisted David with his Indonesians in between looking after 
		the kitten that has appeared at Lumba Lumba yesterday evening.</p>

		I did the morning boat dive to Pantee Peunateung while Roz assisted 
		David with his remaining OW#3 dive with the Indonesians. The visibility 
		at Pantee Peunateung was worse than on any dive since we have been here 
		- it really was like a night dive in places.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		All the Indonesians went 
		out on the boat for their final dive in the afternoon meaning that Roz 
		and I could dive from the beach on our own. This was probably the best 
		beach dive we have done here - we found our way round without any 
		problems and there was loads to see, including a ghost pipe fish. We 
		also did a night dive with Peter and Lara a customer who started diving 
		with us this morning. Did a similar route to the one this afternoon and 
		saw the ghost pipe fish again as well as plenty of other stuff that made 
		the dive reasonably interesting. </p>

		Two dives today. We both did the morning trip to Batee Tokong. Once 
		again the vis was not really good enough for mapping but it was a nice 
		dive and we did get a few more notes down. I think most of our map is 
		going to be copied from an existing one with a few additions and 
		modifications! The second dive was back to the tug boat wreck in Sabang 
		harbour with Lara, Peter and Eric. It was an enjoyable dive again and 
		the stop at the hot springs on the return journey was a lot better than 
		last time due to the water being considerably warmer.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 31st March 2007</font> </b>
		We were at the dive centre by 8 for the 9am dive but found out at about 
		8:40 that it was postponed until midday due to the death and immediate 
		funeral of one of the village elders. Their were only four customers for 
		the dive, two who did not mind waiting and two who were happy to do 
		beach dives instead. Lara came with me and Roz. The vis was dreadful and 
		it was not as enjoyable a dive as the recent beach dives.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The second and third dives were much better. I guided three divers at the 
		Canyon. One had not dived for five years so we did not go to the main 
		site but had a very enjoyable dive along the shore line. Saw a white tip 
		reef shark swimming around which seemed to keep everyone happy. The 
		third dive was supposed to be at Arus Paleh but we changed it to Rubiah 
		Sea Garden due to the experience of the divers we were taking. Once 
		again, it was a relaxing dive, led by Roz, which everyone seemed to 
		enjoy. Ended the dive spending a few minutes with a hawksbill turtle.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Returned to the bungalow by 9 to listen to the football on World 
		Service (Millwall 2, Swansea 1) while finishing off our litre bottle of 
		Bacardi.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0833.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"><font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 1st 
		April 2007</font> </b>Another good days diving although the day did not 
		start well. At the dive centre, we found out that Luca's mother had just 
		died. This was just a day after Marjan flew back to Holland because her 
		father has also died recently. David and Mette are both ill at the 
		moment and there was a bit of concern about whether 
		or not we would have enough guides who knew the site.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We eventually headed off to 
		Pantee Peunateung at 8:45. My first dive was led by Arun with just one 
		customer and me. Roz dived with David's group but he had to end his dive 
		after 20 due to is illness. The second, I led with four customers and Peter. This 
		did not go too well as we went down to 28m and there were strong 
		currents. Two of the group struggled to get back up to a shallower depth 
		as we were swimming into the current and used up most of their air. 
		Ended the dive early after 40 minutes.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were not on the boat for the 3pm dive so me and Roz dived off the 
		beach again. It was a very enjoyable dive and included 15 minutes of 
		watching a turtle destroying coral. Also saw a juvenile bat fish, the 
		stone fish and plenty of blue spotted rays.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Ate fish at Mama Jungle's again although this time we got fed up with 
		waiting for Cedric, Diane and Peter so ate on our own.</p>
