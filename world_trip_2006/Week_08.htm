		We had a late breakfast and then spent a couple of hours walking into Kor<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>ula 
		Town which was another really nice old town. We spent an hour or so 
		wandering round the town and then caught the bus back to Lumbarda. Spent 
		the remainder of the afternoon at the beach again.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had a similar evening to yesterday with a couple 
		of bottles of wine on our terrace and a meal (black risotto) in a 
		restaurant overlooking the sea.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		1st August 2006</font> </b>A similar day to yesterday. We walked round 
		another part of Lumbarda in the morning, beach in the afternoon, wine 
		and pizza in the evening.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Wednesday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		2nd August 2006</font> </b>Due to slightly more wine than usual last 
		night, we did not do a lot in the morning. We used the internet in 
		Lumbarda to find out that we have got some a room sorted out for Corfu 
		but did not do a lot else apart from read on our terrace. We had not 
		intended to drink anything in the evening but were given another bottle 
		of wine (red this time) by the family we are staying with (as well as 
		more meat, a plate of pancakes and two lemons), so drank that before 
		going out for pizza again. Had another litre with our meal but a 
		relatively early night.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0183.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">Thursday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		3rd August 2006</font> </b>We had bought tickets for the 6:45 bus to 
		Dubrovnik and were driven to the bus station by Robert, the owners son. 
		The journey took just over three hours and we were met in Dubrovnik by 
		the owner of the next place we are staying in. We left our luggage in 
		the room and went straight back to the bus station and booked tickets 
		for the Kotor bus in two days time.</p>
		<p align="justify">From the bus station it was about an hours walk to 
		get to the start of the old town. We have seen a few &quot;old towns&quot; since 
		arriving in Croatia, but Dubrovnik is the most famous and certainly, the 
		most impressive. We spent about an hour walking around the sights within 
		the walls and then the highlight which was a 2km walk around the walls. 
		This walk took another hour and included all the towers and ramparts 
		which provided excellent views of the city and surrounding coast. We 
		walked back through the town, stopping for lunch on the way and then 
		walked back to our room near the port.</p>
		<p align="justify">While walking about, we had tried to find a way of 
		visiting Mostar (3 hours away by bus in Bosnia and Hercegovina), 
		tomorrow on a day trip. We could only find out bus times there but not 
		back again which was not ideal as we could not be sure of getting back! 
		The other option was an organised tour that would of cost us 360 kn each 
		(about £34) which seemed expensive and we are not that keen on escorted 
		tours anyway. After a lot of indecision, we found that we could hire a 
		car for 410 kn which seemed the ideal solution. We paid the deposit and 
		arranged to collect it at 7:30 tomorrow morning.</p>
		<p align="justify">Did not do a lot for the remainder of the day due to 
		being totally knackered. Spent a couple of hours sleeping or reading and 
		went out for a meal near the port.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0200.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Friday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		4th August 2006</font> </b>We collected the hire car (Fiat Punto) from 
		just in front of the port and were on our way North from Dubrovnik by 
		about 7:45. We stopped at Ston as it was not far off route and it had 
		looked a reasonably interesting place when we had come through on the 
		bus yesterday. It also had a supermarket so we could buy breakfast! We 
		continued up the coast before turning inland towards Mostar where we 
		arrived at about 11.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had been unsure whether or not to bother going to 
		Mostar but it was really worth the effort. There were only a few sights 
		that we were keen on seeing, mainly the new old bridge, but it was a 
		really interesting place to wander around. The amount of still damaged 
		buildings bought home how badly and how recently the town had been 
		damaged during the war. The way that the town has been restored and 
		generally has recovered from it all was very impressive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0215.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="right">As 
		well as spending a fair bit of time at the bridge, watching the divers, 
		we visited The Turkish House - not very impressive in itself but Roz was 
		able to chase the tortoises around - and also wandered around the area 
		where all the copper beaters used to work, now mainly souvenir shops.</p>
		<p align="justify">On our way back from Mostar, we stopped at Po<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>itelj 
		about 25km to the South. This was a much smaller town that suffered a 
		lot of damage during the war. A lot of the town is still derelict but 
		parts have been restored and the mosque is still intact. We climbed up to 
		the old fort and were able to get to the top of the tower. This was not 
		a particularly popular tourist attraction so was free to enter and 
		totally empty by the time we were at the top. Both Mostar and Po<font face="Times New Roman">&#269;</font>itelj 
		had been excellent places to visit.</p>
		<p align="justify">We drove back to Dubrovnik, stopping for 30 minutes 
		at a beach near Ston and also headed round the road above Dubrovnik for 
		more great views of the old town. We returned the car at about 7 having 
		spent a total of 550 kn, cheaper than the tour and far more enjoyable!</p>
		<p align="justify">We ate locally again and had another early night.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		Saturday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		5th August 2006</font> </b>We left our room at 9:30 and walked down to 
		the bus station, stopping to buy breakfast on the way. The bus to Kotor 
		was totally packed and did not pull out of the bus station until about 
		10:45 - 15 minutes late. It then parked just around the corner from the 
		bus station and waited there another 30 minutes for people who were 
		joining the bus from Zagreb. It took about half an hour to reach the 
		Montenegro border where we had another wait of about 50 minutes, but did 
		get our passports stamped for the first time on the trip. It was obvious 
		at this point that we were going to be late but things got worse once in 
		Montenegro as the traffic along the coast was horrendous and we were 
		travelling through busy seaside resorts. We got caught up in a very 
		lengthy queue to get on a ferry despite the fact that we were not going 
		on the ferry and once past this obstruction, we had the driver driving 
		at suicidal speeds to try and make up some of the lost time. Eventually 
		got to Kotor at about 2:45 only just over an hour late.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0261.JPG" width="157" height="269" align="left">We 
		walked from the bus station to the old town and managed to get an 
		apartment just outside the walls. We got the apartment through an agency 
		and were quite lucky. Not only is this a busy time of year, but we had 
		managed to coincide our arrival with the last day of the Kotor carnival. 
		The apartment had a kitchen and air conditioning and was excellent value 
		for €40. We had only planned to spend one night in Kotor but after a 
		quick look around the town we decided that we both wanted to stay for an 
		extra day. This meant that we could have a few drinks tonight, we could 
		walk up to the fortress that is above the town tomorrow, and we would be 
		travelling into Albania on a Monday instead of a Sunday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After a couple of hours listening to the first day of the football 
		season on World Service (Swansea 1 Cheltenham 2) we drank a bottle of 
		wine (€1.22 a litre) in our kitchen before walking back into the old 
		town. It turned out to be an excellent night. Kotor is possibly my 
		favourite of all the old towns we have visited in the last couple of 
		weeks and has a reputation for being a place that you go to for 
		partying. The carnival added to an excellent atmosphere with most of the 
		people from the carnival wandering around the streets in their costumes. 
		We spent most of the evening in a few bars/restaurants and also bought a couple of 
		bottles to drink while walking around the squares. Everywhere was packed 
		with people drinking and dancing and the festivities still seemed to be 
		going strong when we stopped drinking sometime around 2am.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0269.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		6th August 2006</font> </b>We were woken at about 8am by what sounded 
		like a pneumatic drill in some part of the building that our apartment 
		is in. We managed to get back to sleep in between the drilling and 
		eventually got up for breakfast at about 10:30 with slight hangovers.</p>
		<p align="justify">Just before midday, we began the walk up to the fort. 
		The steps (1500 of them) started just inside the gate nearest to where 
		we are staying. Kotor is on the side of the deepest fjord in Southern 
		Europe and the fort is built immediately above the old town. The walk 
		took a total of about 2 hours and gave us excellent views of the old 
		town and the rest of the fjord.</p>
		<p align="justify">Did not do too much for the rest of the day but did 
		walk out to the bus station to check up on bus times for tomorrow and 
		Roz spent time on the internet looking into accommodation in Greece. 
		Pizza for tea again.</p>
