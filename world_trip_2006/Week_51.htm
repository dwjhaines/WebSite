		Another day of not doing a lot. We had breakfast served in our room at 
		9ish. I made it to the pool for about 30 minutes before we went to 
		lunch. We went to the beach for the first time since arriving here for 
		the sunset at 5:30 but it was not too spectacular so went for a couple 
		of beers instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a &quot;Rijsttafel&quot; included in our room package and we also had 
		this served in our room. This was a selection of several dishes with 
		rice and vegetables, etc and was an excellent meal. We went out for 
		another beer after eating but Roz was getting sleepy by this time and we did not 
		continue drinking.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Checked out of Poppies at 12. It has been an excellent place to stay for 
		a few nights and we have both really enjoyed staying in Kuta again. It 
		was an ideal way to end what has been a very good month in Indonesia!
		We were transferred to the airport for the 2:25 Air Asia flight to KL 
		which left 15 minutes early. The flight took three hours and we arrived 
		in KL just after 5. We had an onward flight from KL to Bangkok, also 
		with Air Asia but we had to enter Malaysia, collect our luggage and 
		check in again. While waiting to check in, we bought another SIM card 
		and managed to sort out our debit cards with Nationwide. We had a couple 
		of arguments about the weight of our check-in luggage and the amount of 
		hand luggage that we were carrying but managed to get through to Bangkok 
		without having to pay any excess baggage charges.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left KL slightly late at 8:40 and got to Bangkok about 2 hours later 
		at 9:45 local time. Arrival in Bangkok all went very smoothly. We were 
		first through immigration, got our luggage quickly and due to the time 
		of arrival, only spent about 30 minutes in the taxi getting to our hotel 
		(Samran Place again).</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Did not do a lot all day. We we went to the MBK for lunch&nbsp;and Roz 
		went got her hair cut, but spent a lot of the day catching up on sleep 
		and sorting out some of our diving photos. We had our final SE Asia 
		session in the evening, starting in the room then continuing with a 
		bottle of Sang Som at our usual restaurant at Siam Square. We had 
		intended to have a relatively early night but bought a third bottle of 
		Sang Som on the way back to the hotel and have no recollection of the 
		end of the evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 31st May 2007</font> </b>
		We checked out of the hotel at 8ish without being too badly hung-over. 
		We got a taxi to the airport, checked in and departed a few minutes late 
		at 11:40. Uneventful 11 hour flight to Düsseldorf. where we arrived at 
		18:30 German time. We got the S-Bahn to the main station where we had 
		booked a night at the Ibis.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After sorting out train tickets for tomorrow morning, we went out for a 
		few beers. We did not make it as far as the old town but found the 
		Paulaner beer hall where we had an excellent meal and 10 wheat beers 
		between us. We stopped for a couple more on the way back to the hotel 
		and had another in the hotel bar sometime after midnight. A very enjoyable 
		night out!</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_1025.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Friday, 1st June 2007</font> </b>Checked out of the 
		hotel at 7:45, once again without being too badly hung-over. We caught a 
		train to Cologne and from there another to the airport and checked in 
		for the EasyJet flight back to Gatwick. Arrived back at Gatwick at 11, 
		picked up a hire car and joined the traffic on the M23/M25. By 1, we had 
		picked up the keys from the estate agent and were back in our house. 
		Everything seemed to be pretty much as it was when we left it although 
		within minutes of our arrival, we had complaints from next door about 
		the tenants that had been in the house for 7 months!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We did not have time to do a lot before heading back up to London for 
		the England v Brazil game at Wembley. We got the 15:05 train from 
		Basingstoke and met up with Mark in a pub near Marylebone station. We 
		were joined by Steve and Kim and all headed to the ground when the pub 
		stopped serving at 6:30. Quite impressed with the ground especially from 
		the inside.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the game we headed for Waterloo as quick as we could and managed 
		to get a train just after 11. Back in Kingsclere just after midnight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 2nd June 2007</font> </b>
		We were both up at about 6:30 after less than 6 hours sleep. We left the 
		house at 7ish and drove down to Swansea. We left the car at Cathy's and 
		got the train from Neath to Cardiff, joining up with Dave and Melissa as 
		well as Julie and niece on the train. We were joined by Regan in The 
		Prince of Wales in Cardiff and stayed in there for a couple of hours 
		before the Wales v Czech Republic game. We all returned there after the 
		game and stayed until about 8 before getting the train back to Swansea 
		(apart from Regan who left at 6:30).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back in Swansea we visited The Adam &amp; Eve and The Potter's Wheel before 
		getting a taxi back to Cathy's. Do not remember a lot about the latter 
		stages of the evening!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 3rd June 2007</font> </b>
		Left Swansea reasonably early and were back in Kingsclere by 12:30. Once 
		again, we were only in the house for a few hours before heading out 
		again, this time to Gatwick for our 7:30 flight to Tallinn. We got there 
		pretty quickly so had three hours to kill before the flight. Uneventful 
		flight and we arrived in Tallinn at 12:30. We were supposed to be 
		collected by someone at the airport but no-one turned up. It took a few 
		phone calls but eventually a taxi was sent to collect us and we were 
		dropped at our apartment at 1ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The apartment we had booked was no longer available so we were upgraded 
		to an apartment that could easily sleep 6 people. It also could not be 
		much better located with superb views looking out on the main square in 
		the old town. Eventually got to bed sometime after 2.</p>
