		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 25th September 2006</font> </b>Day one of our Rescue Diver 
		course. We started the day by completing the EFR course. This involved 
		marking our knowledge reviews, taking an exam and then the skills. We 
		did the skills with Sabry who we had dived with last year. The skills 
		took about an hour and included such things as putting on and removing 
		gloves as well as more complicated procedures such as CPR.&nbsp;We both 
		successfully completed everything meaning that we are qualified to 
		perform first-aid and can now go on to the rescue diver course.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had to watch the PADI videos for the first two sections of the course 
		and then headed off to the lighthouse dive site for the first of the 
		practical exercises. We started with a dive:</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 217: <font face="Times New Roman">Lighthouse</font><br>
		First dive of our rescue diver course. A normal dive for the first 30 
		minutes or so then Roz and I had to pretend to be out of air and surface 
		using each others alternate air source.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		Following the dive, we went through knowledge reviews in one of the 
		restaurants, had lunch and then began the confined water exercises. This 
		mainly involved spending an hour or so rescuing tired or panicked divers 
		(played by Hywel, the trainee DM from yesterday) under the supervision 
		of our instructor for the course, JP. It was all quite good fun and we 
		seemed to be able to do everything that was required. Back at the hotel 
		we spent another 20 minutes watching section 3 of the video and spent 
		the rest of the evening working our way through the next two sections of 
		the book.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 26th September 2006</font> </b>
		Day two of our course. Spent the whole day at the lighthouse. We were 
		based in the restaurant with Hywel and JP again. We started with 
		knowledge reviews and practised a few skills for shore rescues. We had a 
		couple of scenarios where we had to rescue Hywel from the shore and then 
		did two dives:</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7410.JPG" width="256" height="192" align="left">Dive 218: <font face="Times New Roman">Lighthouse</font><br>
		We were told it was to be a fun dive but spent most of the dive sorting 
		out problems with our instructors equipment e.g. loose tank straps, 
		upside down mask, fins falling off, BCD hose disconnected, cramp, panic, 
		etc, etc.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 219: <font face="Times New Roman">Lighthouse</font><br>
		Had to try and find a weight belt some-where in the site we had dived 
		this morning. It did not go too well, mainly due to me swimming too 
		quickly with Roz getting left behind. We swam past it without seeing it 
		but did get to it in the end.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		Totally knackered by the end of the day. We did read some more of the 
		book and started the next knowledge review but gave up at about 7 and 
		walked into Dahab for a few drinks and a meal at El Fanar.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 27th September 2006</font> </b>
		A day off from the course as we wanted to do the boat trip that Reef 
		2000 organise once a week. We were up by 7 and got our equipment ready 
		before going for breakfast. We were driven to the jetty and helped load 
		up the boat - enough equipment and tanks for 27 divers, including the 
		staff. The boat left at about 8:30 and took an about an hour to get to 
		the dive sites at Gabr el Bint - first dive at 9:44. We were led by Dom 
		and were in a group with 4 other divers - Suzanne, Rachel, Tim and Matt.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Bint</font><br>
		First dive of a two dive boat trip from Dahab to Gabr el Bint. Dived 
		with Dom, Suzanne, Rachel, Matt and Tim. Started with a drift dive along 
		a coral wall and swam back through a sandy lagoon area. Very nice dive!</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 221: <font face="Times New Roman">Gabr el 
		Bint</font><br>
		.Similar dive to the first one. Saw a couple of crocodile fish in the 
		lagoon and a devil scorpion fish while doing the safety stop.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		This was the same trip that we did last year and once again, it was an 
		excellent day out. Back at the hotel, we finished off all of our reading 
		for the rescue course and completed most of our knowledge reviews. We 
		then walked into Dahab and had a couple of beers in Adam's Bar and a 
		burger at &quot;Kwickies&quot;.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 28th September 2006</font> </b>
		Back to our course. We spent the whole day at the lighthouse again. We 
		did not log any dives today but had a couple of sessions practising the 
		skills that we will need for tomorrows scenarios. Most of the morning 
		was spent practicing getting an unconscious, non-breathing diver out of 
		the water while giving rescue breaths, and in the afternoon, we learnt 
		how to get an unconscious diver from underwater up to the surface.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		When we got back to the dive centre, we joined JP, Hywel and Rachel for 
		a couple of beers and ended up spending most of the evening with them. 
		We ate in the hotel restaurant by the pool and stayed there until about 
		10:30 . The others all went to a party and we had a beer on the balcony 
		before going to bed. We had not planned to drink tonight but it turned 
		out to be a very enjoyable evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 29th September 2006</font> </b>The final day 
		of our rescue course. We were joined by Rachel who had volunteered to 
		become a second victim and the five of us headed of to the Southern 
		sites that we had dived last Friday. The day involved completing four 
		scenarios. The first two occurred at the end of the first dive there and 
		the next two involved us looking for a missing diver.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 222: <font face="Times New Roman">Moray 
		Gardens</font><br>
		Scenario 1 - Distressed diver underwater, diver out of air, assist 
		injured diver on the surface<br>
		Scenario 2 - Calm and control panicked diver at the surface, tow to 
		safety.<br>
		I had to rescue Hywel who had been &quot;attacked by a shark&quot; while Roz 
		rescued Rachel who was &quot;out of air&quot;. Did not go perfectly but we all 
		seemed to survive! Saw at least one turtle at the start of the dive 
		(possibly two or the same one twice)</font></p>
		<p align="justify">

		<font face="Times New Roman">Moray Gardens</font><br>
		Scenario 3 - Search for missing diver, surface unresponsive diver<br>
		Scenario 4 - Non-breathing diver at the surface<br>
		We found Rachel pretty quickly. The vis was excellent and we could see 
		her bubbles without paying too much attention to search patterns. Made a 
		mess of getting her to safety and had to do that bit again but we are 
		now both Rescue Divers!</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		Everyone had told us before the course that it would be good fun, hard 
		work and that we would learn a lot. This turned out to be pretty 
		accurate. While it had been tiring, the whole thing has been very 
		enjoyable and well worth doing.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The five of us who had been diving today had planned on doing a night 
		dive, but by the time we got back to the dive centre, everyone was more 
		interested in starting on the beer again. We spent a couple of hours 
		drinking and playing a dice game that Hywel had and then continued 
		drinking while we ate at the restaurant by the pool. Got to bed sometime 
		around 11:30 I think. Another very good evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 30th September 2006</font> </b>
		We were back to fun diving today.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0396.JPG" width="256" height="192" align="left">Dive 224:
		<font face="Times New Roman">Abu Hilal</font><br>
		First time we had dived this site. Dived with Matt (who we had dived 
		with last year) and two Germans. Another very nice dive site with loads 
		of coral. Saw a large Napoleon wrasse.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 225: <font face="Times New Roman">Islands</font><br>
		A superb dive at one of my favourite sites in Dahab. Spent more time 
		swimming around the islands than when we were here last week and it was 
		a much more enjoyable dive because of that.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		The second dive in particular was excellent. The sea was totally flat 
		today so it was a very good dive for photographs with plenty of light. 
		We were back at Reef 2000 by 3ish so had time to have lunch by the pool 
		before listening to the football (Forest 3, Swansea 1).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the football, we walked into Dahab to eat. We had invited Rachel 
		to join us and met her in Adams Bar. We had a few beers there and ate at 
		Al Fanar again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 1st October 2006</font> </b>
		Two more fun dives with Matt.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">
		Dive 226: <font face="Times New Roman">Bells &#8594; Blue Hole</font><br>
		A really nice dive again. Dived with Matt, Hywel and Martin, one of the 
		Germans from yesterday.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 227: <font face="Times New Roman">Blue Hole</font><br>
		Dived the right side of the Blue Hole i.e. we crossed the hole and 
		descended to 20m before turning right. Kept going for 30 minutes before 
		turning round and coming back at about 10m.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		Martin complained about a headache at the end of the first dive and was 
		ill in the restaurant when we were waiting between dives. We left him 
		sleeping while we did the second dive but he had deteriorated quite 
		dramatically by the time we got back. He had to be just about carried 
		back to the car and was looking very unhealthy by the time we got back 
		to Reef 2000. We had called out the doctor but when he started 
		complaining about numbness in his hands, Matt and Hywel took him 
		directly to the doctor at the chamber in Dahab. It turned out that he 
		had gastroenteritis and was able to walk on his own when he returned a 
		couple of hours later but it had been quite worrying at one point.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel, we had a late lunch and spent an hour at the pool 
		before saying goodbye to Rachel (and Tim!) who was flying home this 
		evening. After showers, we walked into Dahab for our usual beers at 
		Adams bar and meal at Al Fanar.</p>
