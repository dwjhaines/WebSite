		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 6th November 2006</font> </b>Another trip out to Mnemba for a 
		repeat of the dives we did last Tuesday. Dived with 8 people from an 
		overland trip - again with varying levels of experience. We saw turtles 
		on both dives including the biggest we have ever seen on the second.
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/IMG_0153.JPG" width="271" height="204" align="left"></b></font>Both 
		dives were shorter than they could of been due to the size of the group 
		and the lack of experience of some of the other divers - a definite 
		negative to diving with Sensation Divers.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 6th November 2006</font> </b>
		Our last two dives in Zanzibar. After having a word with Peter, we 
		managed to get into a smaller group (Bret, a DM, us and two others) 
		allowing us to dive for longer. The first dive was nothing special but 
		the second was one of the best we have done here (Shayne's Reef again). 
		We saw an incredible amount of fish and a final turtle.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in time to have lunch on our balcony and then spent an hour 
		or so on the beach.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At 4:45 we went back to Sensation Divers to collect our passports, etc 
		from their safe. This did not turn out to be as easy as expected as 
		no-one knew where the key was or how to get in touch with Peter. We 
		ended up going for a beer in Cholo's Bar while Brett tracked down Peter 
		to get the key.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0515.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		got another round in when Brett eventually appeared with the money belt 
		and ended up staying until about 8:30. We were joined by Peter who got a 
		couple more rounds in and we were both already quite pissed when we left 
		the bar.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After getting changed, we went back to the same restaurant that we have 
		eaten in for the last eight nights for a final tuna curry. We had a few 
		more drinks there and one more in a bar on the way back. Neither of us 
		remember anything about getting back to the room!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 7th November 2006</font> </b>
		We checked out of our hotel at 9:30 with slight hangovers. We got 
		straight into a minibus that took two hours to get us to Stonetown. We 
		had half an hour on the internet, had lunch and then got a taxi out to 
		the airport for the 2:30 flight to Tanga.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The flights were excellent. We were in a 13-seater plane which only had 
		4 - 5 other passengers for the ZNZ <font face="Times New Roman">&#8594; Pemba 
		leg and just one for the flight from Pemba &#8594; Tanga. The views were 
		superb especially for Roz who was sat next to the pilot&nbsp; for both 
		flights.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0519.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">We arrived in Tanga at 4ish and, after 
		failing to agree the price of a taxi, got a free lift into town with a 
		Pilipino security worker. We checked into a hotel and went to try and 
		sort out bus tickets for tomorrow. We failed to do this due to there 
		being no ideal buses to Arusha and too much hassle from the touts at the 
		station. We considered the possibility of going back to Nairobi via 
		Mombassa instead (using Scandinavian Express) but eventually decided to 
		try again for Arusha tomorrow (with the option of going to Mombassa at 
		1:30 if that fails).</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">Tanga is relatively safe compared to some 
		cities in this part of the world but still was not too pleasant for 
		wandering around after dark. We went out for a meal but were back in the 
		room by 8.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 8th November 2006</font> </b>
		We were awake early and waited for the rain to stop before checking out 
		of the hotel and walking to the bus station. There was just as much 
		chaos there as yesterday but by 7:45 we were sat on an Arusha bus which 
		departed on time at 8.The bus had 5 seats in each row - something we had 
		hoped to avoid - but was not full until Moshi so we had more than one 
		seat each for most of the way. We arrived in Arusha just after 3. There 
		was more hassle from the touts at the bus station but we eventually 
		managed to lose them and checked into the Flamingo Hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Someone at reception said he could take me to somewhere that repaired 
		cameras. This turned out to be a waste of time - the main purpose of 
		which was to try and sell me a safari. However, we were later directed 
		to a shop that did repairs. It was closing as we got there but we were 
		given the name of somewhere that will be able to look at the camera 
		tomorrow. We decided that we would give this a go and then head on to 
		Namanga on the Kenyan border. Regardless of whether or not it can be 
		fixed, we will not go back to Nairobi but will get picked up by Best 
		Camping at Namanga.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the hotel for showers and then went out for an early tea 
		- yet another city where being safely back in the room before 8 seemed a 
		good idea. The electricity went off at about 8 so it was a very early 
		night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 9th November 2006</font> </b>After breakfast, 
		we walked to Naaz's Photo Studio in an attempt to get my camera fixed. 
		&quot;Mr Norman&quot; appeared at about 8:30 and we left the camera with him for 
		his technician to look at. We checked out of the hotel at 10 and 
		returned to the shop to get our photos put onto CD and then went and 
		spent an hour or so on the internet. We returned to the shop for 12 and 
		were given the news that the main board of the camera will need 
		replacing and it would have to go back to Canon. We got the camera back 
		(no charge) and returned to the internet cafe to look at possible 
		replacements as repairing it could be too costly and not very 
		convenient. If it has to go back to Canon it is unlikely that we would 
		be able to do this before we go to Thailand. Replacing it did look the 
		best option but this will have to happen in England and certainly not 
		before the safari on Saturday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We collected our luggage and walked to the bus station where there was 
		the usual scramble of touts trying to overcharge us. We eventually got 
		onto a minibus that charged us the same as the locals - Tshs3500 - to 
		Namanga.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At Namanga, we could not get into the only decent hotel and ended up in 
		a pretty grotty room - the worst of the trip so far. The camera made an 
		incredible return to life before we went out to eat but had died again 
		by the time we got back.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 10th November 
		2006</font> </b>We had a relatively late breakfast before checking out 
		of the hotel at about 10:30. We walked up to the petrol station where 
		Best Camping were supposed to be picking us up between 12 and 1. There 
		was a reasonably good place to sit and wait without being hassled by 
		touts and salesmen.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		No-one had turned up to collect us by 1. We phoned Best Camping at 1:45 
		to find that the bus had not left Nairobi until 12:00 and was unlikely 
		to reach us before 2:30. It eventually turned up at 3 meaning that we 
		had spent 4 hours at the petrol station and almost 24 hours in Namanga. 
		We were not too pleased with this and after several phone calls, Roz 
		managed to speak to Sheraz's wife who promised us a $25 refund each.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0548.JPG" width="267" height="200" align="left">Once 
		this was resolved, we could concentrate on the safari! We had a better 
		minibus than on the fist safari but we are sharing it with a German 
		couple. It took about 90 minutes to reach the entrance to Amboseli N.P. 
		and we began the first game drive as soon as we were through the gate.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		There is not the same concentration of animals as in Maasi Mara but this 
		is compensated for by excellent scenery and views of Kilimanjaro which 
		was clearly visible for most of the drive. Still plenty of animals to 
		see including a lion, elephants, zebra. We could not get as close to the 
		animals as in the Maasi Mara due to the rules about staying on the roads 
		being more strictly enforced but it was all very spectacular 
		nonetheless.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We arrived at the campsite at about 6:30. It was more basic than the 
		previous one we had been to but was a much nicer setting, with &quot;Kili&quot; 
		visible behind the tents. We got football results via a combination of 
		World Service and text messages, had fish &amp; chips for tea and headed off 
		to our tent at about 9:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 11th November 
		2006</font> </b>Our first game drive of the day was at 6:30. Once again, 
		Kilimanjaro was clearly visible for the whole drive. Plenty of elephants 
		all over the park in larger herds than we have seen elsewhere. We spent 
		a lot of time watching a lion guarding a buffalo that he and another 
		lion had killed. The lions rest after a kill before eating but one of 
		the lions had to guard the dead buffalo from the packs of hyenas and 
		vultures. The scene was incredible with the dead buffalo, the lion sat 
		next to it, hyena waiting to move in, all with herds of elephants and 
		Kilimanjaro in the background.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/Africa_0716.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">On our second drive, after breakfast, we walked up to an observation 
		point for good views of the park and got close up views of three 
		elephants. We returned to the dead buffalo and spent a while watching 
		the lion, still resting by its side. After a while, the lion moved off 
		to move to the near-by swamp only to come rushing back to chase off the 
		hyenas as they started on the buffalo.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The third drive did not start brilliantly and after an hour or so 
		&quot;safari fatigue&quot; seemed to be setting in. No-one could be bothered to go 
		and look at buffalo and there did not seem to be too much else around. 
		Things did pick up however. We got the classic picture of elephants in 
		front of Kilimanjaro and must of seen well over 100 elephants in total. 
		We returned to see the two lions still guarding their buffalo and got 
		great views of the sunset on the way back.</p>
