		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 9th April 2007</font> </b>We were up just before 7 as we had to 
		walk to Iboih to get our medical certificates signed by a doctor. We 
		were at the hospital by 7:45 for an 8 o'clock appointment that Luca had 
		arranged for us. We saw the doctor straight away and 10 minutes later, 
		after checking our blood pressure, he pronounced us both fit to dive and 
		relieved us of Rp100,000. We walked back to Gapang and were back at the 
		dive centre by 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Getting back at this time meant that we could do the 10:00 dive at Batee 
		Gla. We&nbsp; had not dived here before so could not guide but followed 
		Luca and three customers. I went up to the shallow area with Stephane 
		after about 40 minutes as he was low on air and this was probably the 
		nicest part of the dive. We were the only ones on the boat to see a 
		turtle. We both guided different groups at Batee Tokong on the afternoon 
		dive. I took Sven and Mario while Roz did her supervised guiding with 
		Mette. This all went OK so we should both be signed off as DM's by 
		tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We found out today that I could do the dive at the deep wreck tomorrow 
		and that we can both go on the trip to Meuduro on Wednesday. This is 
		supposed to be one of the best sites on the island and is done as a two 
		tank day trip. We decided that we may as well hang around for this trip 
		and then leave on Friday. We spoke to Ton and asked him if he could book 
		our flights to Medan for Friday afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/Asia_1312.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"><font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		10th April 2007</font> </b>There were three boat trips today. I was on 
		the second one at midday to the deep wreck while Roz went on the other 
		two to Pantee Peunateung and Rubiah Sea Garden.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The deep wreck is the WWII cargo steam ship the &quot;Sophie Rickmers&quot; lying 
		in about 70m of water. The upper deck is at about 48 - 50m with the top 
		of the wheel house at about 38m. The dive was led by Mette taking Wilco 
		and Ayesha who are both experienced technical divers, as well as me and 
		Flo.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The vis at the surface was terrible and it looked as if we may have to 
		abort the dive but once below 10m, it cleared up completely. It was 
		quite eerie descending through the jellyfish with beautifully clear blue 
		water but very little sun coming through. We could see the wreck from 
		about 20m above it and continued straight down to our maximum depth 
		which was 50m for me.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We descended on the stern mooring line and then swam towards the front 
		of a boat. All around us there were huge numbers of batfish as well as 
		large groupers although looking at the wreck itself and checking depth 
		and time meant that I was not concentrating too much on the fish. It 
		took about 12 minutes to get to the front mooring line and so we still 
		had about 4 - 5 minutes of our 18 minute bottom time to swim around the 
		wheel house before beginning our ascent up the mooring line. The ascent 
		took a total of 53 minutes with decompression stops at 22m, 12m, 9m, 6m and 
		about 25 minutes at 3m. By the time we were at 3m, vis was back down to 
		about 1m and I could not see Flo who was holding the line next to me. An 
		excellent dive and an interesting experience, although the amount of bottom 
		time compared to the amount of time doing decompression stops meant that 
		it is not something that you would want to repeat too often!.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I could not dive again for the rest of the day due to the depth of the 
		wreck dive so spent the afternoon in the shop finishing my book.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_2809.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right"><font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		11th April 2007</font> </b>We were at the dive centre by 7 for the day 
		trip to Batee Meuduro. We were on a bigger boat for the trip and had to 
		load it up with all the gear and about 40 tanks. There were 12 customers 
		on the trip (including us) and six staff.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The boat trip out to Meuduro on the South of Pulau Weh took a couple of 
		hours. We were in the third group to go in the water with Collet, Peter 
		and Ampon. Initially the dive was a drift dive in very strong current. 
		The visibility was better than we have been used to here and it was 
		quite enjoyable. We saw a moray eel with an octopus in its mouth and a 
		Napoleon wrasse, before heading up to shallower water after about 20 
		minutes. At about 10m, we reached the start of the plateau. This was a 
		large area covered with spectacular table coral. We spent the next 45 - 
		50 minutes swimming around this impressive area. The area is known for 
		sharks that sleep under the coral and we managed to find two (although I 
		did not realise that there were two as I photographed them!). The second 
		dive was very similar to the first although we did not find the sharks 
		again. Both dives were excelletn and it had definitely been worth 
		staying on an extra couple of days to make this trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in Gapang by about 5 and, after cleaning the equipment, we 
		spent about an hour paying our bill at Lumba Lumba. This came to 
		approximately £1200 which did not seem bad for our DM course, the study 
		materials and 39 nights accommodation at Laguna. The bill also included 
		things like 2 slates, 2 log-books, 590 minutes of internet use, 111 cans 
		of diet coke, a battery for Roz's computer, insect repellent, 5 beers 
		and €36 for today's excursion&nbsp; and the trip to the deep wreck. As 
		we have both done over 70 dives here it has been some of the cheapest 
		diving we have ever done.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out at Mama Jungle's again with David, Flo, Peter and Ayesha and 
		Wilco who are leaving tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0866.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		12th April 2007</font> </b>Our last day at Gapang. We had a good start 
		to the day - I found out from the internet that England's first game at 
		Wembley is to be on June 1st. This is very good news for us as we fly 
		back into Gatwick on this date and we had heard rumours that the game 
		was to be played on 31st May.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were able to do the first dive of the day to The Canyon. Roz led the 
		dive again with two customers plus me and Danil. The vis was OK and 
		there were no currents so it was a nice enough dive to finish with. Back 
		at the dive centre, we washed all our gear and had lunch before going 
		round paying our bills at Limbo's and Ohana's, the two restaurants where 
		we have eaten most of our meals since we arrived here. We also paid for 
		our flights for tomorrow - Rp300,000 each to fly from Banda Aceh to 
		Medan. Spent most of the afternoon lazing around at the dive centre 
		before returning to our room to start packing just after 4.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0872.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right"></b></font>At the moment, we have no idea where we will spend the next week. We 
		intend to look to see if there are any cheap flight options available to 
		us when we get to Medan airport. If there is nothing from there we will 
		look again when we arrive in Penang. If there is nothing there we will probably get a 
		bus/minibus up to Thailand for a few days before coming back down to 
		Penang on the 20th when we have the Bay View Hotel booked again for three 
		nights.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went down to the dive centre for the last time in the evening. Most 
		of the staff had already left so after a quick check on the internet for 
		flight options, we said our goodbyes to Ton and went to eat at Ohanas 
		again. Back in the room by 8:45</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 
		13th April 2007</font> </b>After 39 nights here, we left Laguna Resort 
		at 6:50am. We were picked up by Yong in his minibus and driven to the 
		port for the 8:30 fast ferry to Banda Aceh. <b><font size="4">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0879.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"></font></b>We 
		did not have too much time to spare when we arrived in Banda Aceh - the 
		ferry arrived at 9:40 and our flight was due to leave at 11:10. We also 
		had to drive into the town to collect our plane tickets from a travel 
		agent. We got a taxi as soon as we got off the ferry and picked up the 
		tickets by 9:55, passing the central mosque on the way. We left Alex at 
		the travel agent - he had been with us from Gapang but was dithering 
		about and we could not afford to wait!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got to the airport at about 10:20 and had plenty of time to check in. 
		The flight was slightly late but we were still in Medan by 12:30. We had 
		a quick look at flights to Penang but these would of cost us $40 each. 
		Instead, we changed our Adam Air tickets for the third time and we fly 
		to Penang at 7:10 tomorrow morning. We than got a taxi to a hotel in 
		Medan that had been recommended to us by Mette.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The hotel seemed very luxurious after six weeks in Gapang. We had an 
		air-conditioned room with luxuries like a shower, a sink, hot water, a 
		fridge, TV and a comfortable double bed all for about £20. There was 
		also a swimming pool that we never got to. One of the reasons we had 
		chosen the hotel was its proximity to Sun Plaza. We headed there for 
		lunch and in the absence of McDonalds, we ate at Pizza Hut. We had no 
		great desire to see what few sights Medan had to offer so spent the rest 
		of the afternoon in our room.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the evening we walked across to Sun Plaza again and visited the 
		hypermarket. We bought French bread and cheddar cheese together with a 
		few cans of beer and took it all back to the hotel to consume. A very 
		enjoyable evening!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Saturday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		14th April 2007</font> </b>Another early start. We left the hotel at 
		5:40 and got a taxi to the airport. We checked in without any problems 
		and left on time at 7:10, arriving in Penang just before 9:00 local 
		time. We went up to the departures area to see if there was anywhere we 
		could fly to. We were not too optimistic of getting anything but found 
		that a new airline - Firefly - was flying direct to Samui and there was 
		a departure at 11:30. We were both keen on going back to Samui but had 
		given up on the idea as it was too much hassle to get there. We went to 
		the ticket office only to be told that the service was not running yet 
		but the first flight was tomorrow. After a bit of thought, we decided 
		that we would book flights for tomorrow and fly back to Penang on 
		Friday. We bought the tickets for RM475 each - about £70.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We tried to book ourselves into the Bay View for tonight but they only 
		had deluxe rooms available. We got a taxi to Lebuh Chulia and looked 
		round a few hotels before taking a room just round the corner from the 
		main backpacker area. It was not quite up to last nights standards but 
		had air-con and a fridge so is fine for a night. We had roti chanai for 
		breakfast, spent a couple of hours on the internet, I had a haircut, and 
		we started looking at cameras again. I had donated my old underwater 
		camera to Lumba Lumba and am hoping to get a more up-to-date replacement 
		for my birthday! After more roti chanai for lunch, we returned to the 
		hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After six and a half weeks, it was time for a session again. We had a 
		couple of glasses of the Bacardi that we had picked up duty free this 
		morning and then returned to Lebuh Chulia where we met up with Wilco and 
		Ayesha in the bar of the hotel where they are staying. We had a couple 
		of beers there and all went to Sri Ananda Bahwan for another exellent 
		curry. We had another beer with the meal and then returned to the room 
		to listen to the football (Bournemouth 2, Swansea 2).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were not that pissed when we got back to the room but we continued 
		drinking the Bacardi, finishing most of the bottle and I do not really 
		remember the end of the evening. We spoke to Regan, Cathy and Aleks 
		during the session due to the 3p a minute phone calls you can get on 
		DigiCom.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0880.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		15th April 2007</font> </b>After breakfast of more roti chanai, we got a 
		taxi out to the airport for the 11:30 flight to Samui. After checking 
		in, we went to the Air Asia office and booked flights from Bali to 
		Bangkok, via KL for 29th May.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The flight was on 
		time and by midday, we had landed in Samui. We got a taxi to Lamai and 
		returned to Weekender where we checked into a bungalow for five nights. 
		It was strange being back again particularly as we had really thought we 
		would be coming here on this trip. There had been a few changes to Lamai 
		in the three years since we were here last but nothing too dramatic. The 
		bungalows at Weekender are still the same and Landhaus is still in the same place so 
		we were both happy!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent the afternoon lying by the pool and started drinking again at 7. 
		We had a couple of drinks on our balcony and then went to Landhaus. We 
		had an excellent meal and got through twelve bottles of wheat beer 
		between us while watching three different football matches from England. 
		I do not remember a lot about the final game!</p>
