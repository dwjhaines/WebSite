		Monday, 
		14th August 2006</font> </b>We got the 10:30 bus into Corfu Town and 
		then walked the 1.5km to the airport where we arrived at about 11:30. We 
		were not expecting too much from Corfu Airport but were surprised at 
		what appeared to be total chaos when we arrived. The airport is not big 
		enough to cope with the amount of people using it so there were long 
		queues of people standing outside in the sun. Roz and I joined our 
		respective queues and waited to check in. It turned out to be reasonably 
		well organised and I was checked in for my flight by&nbsp; 12:15 with 45 
		minutes until departure. I left Roz in her queue and headed off to the 
		departure gates.</p>
		<p align="justify">My flight left on time and I was at Birmingham by 
		14:30. I sorted out the hire car details and waited in the car-park 
		until Roz&nbsp; arrived about two hours later. It had all worked out 
		reasonably successfully and we were at the hospital for visiting before 
		6pm.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		15th August 2006</font> </b>Spent the morning at Roz's mum's house 
		sorting out washing and using the internet to cancel, change or make new 
		hotel bookings for the next few weeks. Most of the rest of the day was 
		taken up with visiting the hospital.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0393.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		16th August 2006</font> </b>We went to a pub with John for lunch and 
		then had our final visit to the hospital. We said our goodbyes and drove 
		directly to Manchester for the Greece friendly. We found an ideal 
		parking space close to the ground, picked up our tickets and just had 
		time to meet Steve, Kim and Kellie for a pint before kick-off. We got 
		totally soaked walking to the ground due to heavy shower and no wet 
		weather gear but made it into our seats in time for the national 
		anthems.</p>
		<p align="justify">The game was very enjoyable and certainly more 
		entertaining than some of the games in Germany had been. We were sat in 
		the ideal place to get back to the our parking place and were in the car 
		within 5 minutes of final whistle. We then had to drive down to Wheatley 
		where we had arranged to stay with Regan. We arrived there at about 
		12:45, totally knackered. Regan had left the door open for us and gone 
		to bed so we went straight in and joined Harvey in the spare room.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		17th August 2006</font> </b>We left Wheatley at 7:20 and drove to 
		Heathrow in just over an hour. We returned he car to Hertz hoping they 
		would not notice the new scratch on the side of the car from the 
		hospital car-park although I will be surprised if they do not charge me 
		for it. We were early arriving at terminal 2 and were first in the 
		Olympic check-in queue. We checked in at 9:30 and had no problems at all 
		with the increased security checks and hand luggage restrictions. In 
		fact we seemed to get through quicker than usual. We had a couple of 
		pints in the Wetherspoons before departure and made our way to the gate 
		at midday. The flight was due to leave at 12:30 and pulled out not long 
		after. However, we then joined the longest queue of planes we have ever 
		experienced at Heathrow and were running an hour late by the time we 
		took off.</p>
		<p align="justify">The flight was pretty good and gave us excellent 
		views of both Venice and Corfu. While flying past Venice, it was 
		possible to clearly see both the Grand Canal and St Mark's square. All 
		of Corfu was visible and we could make out Corfu Town and the airport we 
		left from a few days ago. We had a few glasses of wine during the flight 
		and by the time we landed in Athens, we were, once again, both totally knackered due 
		to a combination of alcohol and a lack of sleep over the last few days. 
		We booked our ferry tickets for tomorrow at the airport and got the 
		metro into the centre of Athens. We checked into our hotel in the 
		Monastiraki area which was handy for both the airport metro and trains 
		to Piraeus. After showers we got takeaway souvlaki, a speciality of this 
		part of Athens, and had an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Friday, 
		18th August 2006</font> </b>Another early start as we had to get the 
		8:10 ferry from Piraeus to Paros. We got the metro down to the port and 
		boarded the ferry which left on time and arrived in Paros just before 
		1:30. We were met at the port in Paros by someone from the apartments 
		where we were staying and by 2:30 were lying by the pool. We are staying 
		in one of the &quot;budget&quot; rooms which means it is below ground level and 
		only has one small window close to the ceiling. However, it has a 
		fridge, is reasonably cool, it's close to the centre of Parikia and is 
		excellent value at €31 a night.
		We 
		had a couple of hours in the sun and then went for a walk around 
		Parikia, the main town on Paros.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had been unsure of what to do between leaving 
		everyone in Santorini in 11 days time and getting into Macedonia for the 
		England game eight days later. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0416.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">We were quite keen on visiting the 
		monasteries in Northern Greece but due to our trip back to England, we 
		missed out on a couple of days in Athens and still want to see the 
		sights there. Getting to the monasteries seems easy enough but getting 
		from there to where we want to go in Macedonia looks like hard work and 
		may not be possible in a day. Given that we both liked our accommodation 
		and liked Parikia, we decided that we will probably return to Paros on 
		our way back to Athens and give the monasteries a miss.</p>
		<p align="justify">On our walk around Parikia we bought a few bottles of 
		beer which we drank by the pool before going out for our evening meal. 
		Roz had found out that her mum was out of hospital and we both felt like 
		having a few drinks. We ate in a pizza place overlooking the sea and then found somewhere 
		doing house white wine for €5.50 a litre. By the time we left there, we 
		had drank 3.5 litres of wine and neither of us remember walking home.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Saturd</b></font><b><font size="4">ay, 
		19th August 2006</font> </b>Woke up quite late and had breakfast in the 
		restaurant where we are staying. <font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0421.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left"></b></font>After a couple of hours by the pool, we 
		walked into Parikia for lunch. We 
		booked our ferry tickets for when we leave Paros for a second time in 10 
		days (we had previously booked an apartment for two nights in the place 
		we are staying at the moment) and then wandered round the Church of 100 doors, the main sight 
		here. Had another couple of hours by the pool and then listened to the 
		football on World Service&nbsp; (Swansea 2 Doncaster 0 - Sunderland lost 
		again!)</p>
		<p align="justify">We got bored waiting to be served when we went out 
		for tea so ended up getting our second take-away kebab of the day for 
		our evening meal. We were back in our room by 9:30 and had an early 
		night due to having to get up at 5:20 tomorrow. </p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Sund</b></font><b><font size="4">ay, 
		20th August 2006</font> </b>Woke up just before the alarm and walked 
		down to the port. We had kebabs for breakfast, making it three 
		consecutive meals. The boat was due at 6:20 and was only about 10 
		minutes late. Once aboard we found, Regan (complete with shaved head), 
		Annette, Hoggy, Sarah and Ed and we were joined an hour or so later by 
		Dave and Melissa who got on at Naxos. We arrived on Amorgos just before 
		11 and six of us were picked up by the Poseidon mini-bus. Dave, Melissa 
		and Ed were booked into a different hotel (although their booking failed 
		and they ended up all being in the same room!)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0430.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">Once 
		our room was sorted out, we had lunch on the balcony and then spent a 
		couple of hours on the beach which is only a 10 minute walk from where 
		we are staying. We started drinking at 5. Although our balconies were 
		not too big, they were all in a line which meant we could have one guest 
		each and the nine of us could all sit together. We stayed on the 
		balconies until 8ish and then went out to eat. We got fed up of not 
		being served in he first place we tried but finally got our drinks in 
		the next restaurant just after 9. Despite the slow service, we managed 
		to get through quite a lot of wine and retsina before moving on to 
		another taverna at about 1am. There were just six of us left by then but 
		we managed to get through another couple of litres before staggering 
		home at about 2.</p>
