		<b><font size="4">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7286.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">Monday, 18th September 2006</font> </b>We were not expecting the train 
		to get into Cairo until 9ish but we arrived just after 7. We got a taxi 
		to the bus station to buy our tickets for tomorrow morning and another 
		taxi to the Ramses Hilton where we had booked a room for the night. We 
		were able to check in straight away and got a room on the 16th floor 
		with a great view of the city. Despite sleeping reasonably well on the 
		train, we were both still tired and spent most of the rest of the 
		morning asleep. There was nothing we particularly wanted to see in Cairo 
		and we wanted to make the most of the relative luxury of our hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out for lunch at mid-day and spent the rest of the afternoon by 
		the pool. We both felt like a change from Egyptian food in the evening 
		so headed out looking for Pizza Hut. However, the area where the 
		restaurant was supposed to be was packed with riot police due to some 
		sort of demonstration that was taking place. There did not seem to be 
		any trouble there but we decided to get away from the area anyway and 
		ended up going for an Italian meal in the Nile Hilton, a couple of 
		hundred metres from our hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 19th September 2006</font> </b>
		Another early start. We checked out of the hotel at 6:45 and got a taxi 
		to the bus station for the 7:30 bus back to Sharm. The bus left on time 
		and immediately went back to the area outside our hotel to pick up more 
		passengers! It took about an hour to get out of Cairo and then another 
		five and a half hours to complete the journey to Sharm. We got a taxi 
		from the bus station to Na'ama Bay and walked to the Camel Hotel. This 
		time they had our reservation sorted out and we got our room straight 
		away.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0314.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">Did not do much for the remainder of the afternoon apart from a trip to 
		McDonalds for lunch and some time checking e-mail etc. we decided that 
		it was time for a few beers as we are yet to have any alcohol since 
		arriving in Egypt. We bought bottles of Stella from a bottle shop and 
		drank most of them sat on our balcony. We ate at the Indian restaurant 
		at our hotel. This cost a bit more than the rest of the food we have 
		been eating in Egypt but was well worth the money as the food was 
		superb. We bought a few more beers from another shop and finished up the 
		evening with a couple more on our balcony.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 20th September 2006</font> </b>
		Did not do a lot today. We had free internet access in the room so spent 
		quite a bit of time sending e-mail, catching up on football news, etc. 
		Other than that, we lay by the pool and read for most of the day. We got 
		takeaways for lunch and returned to the restaurant where we had eaten on 
		our last visit to Sharm in the evening. We finished off the beer that we 
		had left over from yesterday on our balcony and were in bed by 11.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 21st September 2006</font> </b>
		We were picked up at midday by a minibus to transfer us to the Bedouin 
		Moon Hotel in Dahab. This was included in the package that we had booked 
		with Dive Tours back home. We were dropped at the hotel just after 1pm. 
		We checked into a room overlooking the sea, a few doors down from the 
		room that we left 52 weeks ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After lunch, we checked into the dive centre and sorted out all our 
		equipment for tomorrow. We were allocated our lockers and put all our 
		own stuff away together with the equipment that we were renting. Spent 
		the rest of the afternoon by the pool. We walked into the main part of 
		Dahab in the evening and found that the restaurant that we always ate at 
		last year had not changed much and the food was still very good. In fact 
		not much had changed at all in Dahab apart from the fact that there did 
		not seem to be as many people around as last year and the taxis to get 
		back to our hotel have gone up from LE5 to LE10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 22nd September 2006</font> </b>Our first day 
		of diving with Reef 2000. We were up at what we thought was 7:30 only to 
		find out that the clocks had gone back an hour and it was in fact 6:45 
		when we got to the restaurant for breakfast. We were expecting the 
		clocks to move in a weeks time but it had been moved forward due to the 
		start of Ramadan.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At about 9, we set off for the dive sites about 15 - 20 minutes South of 
		Dahab. There were five of us diving with Mark, the dive leader.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 211: Golden Blocks
		<font face="Times New Roman">&#8594; Moray Gardens<br>
		First dive of a twenty dive package with Reef 2000 in Dahab. We were 
		driven to dive sites 15 minutes South of Dahab. A nice, easy dive to 
		start with - nothing particularly spectacular but very enjoyable anyway. 
		Roz had problems with her weights and had to be given 2 extra kg towards 
		the end of the dive.</font></font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 212: Three Pools <font face="Times New Roman">
		&#8594; Moray Gardens<br>
		Another enjoyable dive, this time starting South of Moray Gardens and 
		swimming back. The dive started by swimming through three pools with 
		shallow entries/exits to each one before getting out to open water.</font></font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We were sat in a restaurant while we were 
		not diving, in a very spectacular setting with the sea on one side of us 
		and mountains on the other. We liked the other people in the group and 
		the trip was an ideal start to our diving here.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We were not back at the hotel until just 
		after 4pm and then spent an hour or so in the dive centre, putting away 
		our kit, writing log books etc. We stopped for a couple of beers on our 
		way into Dahab and then went for an all you can eat meal&nbsp; at a 
		restaurant that had been recommended to us earlier. Spent a lot of the 
		evening discussing whether or not it would be a good idea to do our 
		Rescue Diver course while we are here instead of doing it in Lanta in 
		December.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 23rd September 2006</font> </b>
		Another two dives, this time with a trip back to the hotel for lunch in 
		between. The first was 5 minutes North of the hotel, the second just to 
		the South of Dahab.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 213: Rick's Reef
		<font face="Times New Roman">&#8594; Canyon<br>
		A repeat of the first dive we did last year. Dived with Mark again and 
		Tim, a very experienced diver from England. Another good dive with 
		plenty of small fish and colourful coral</font></font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000FF">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7217.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left"></font><font color="#0000FF">Dive 214: 
		<font face="Times New Roman">
		Islands<br>
		One of my favourite dive sites from last year in Dahab. We entered the 
		dive site through a narrow crack in the reef followed by a small 
		swim-through. Lots of very spectacular hard coral formations. Saw some 
		bigger fish on this dive including a large puffer fish and a Napoleon 
		wrasse.</font></font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We finished earlier today so were back in 
		the room for the start of the football but had next to no reception on 
		the World Service frequencies until the second half (Swansea 1, 
		Huddersfield 2). We had showers and walked into Dahab after the football 
		had finished. We went to check e-mail (I have a summons from 
		Chesterfield police but no world cup refund) and also to compare the 
		prices of doing the Rescue Diver course in Thailand instead of here. 
		There was not a huge difference and after a couple of beers, we decided 
		that we would go for it while we were here. Had another beer with our 
		meal at El Fanar and got a taxi back to the hotel.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 24th September 2006</font> </b>
		After breakfast, we notified the dive centre that we wanted to proceed 
		with the Rescue Diver course. We discovered that we could do EFR without 
		missing a days diving which was good news. Did two dives with JP, two 
		other customers and a trainee DM.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0326.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Dive 215: Canyon<br>
		We dived with JP and three others, including a trainee DM and Rob who we 
		dived with two days ago. Very spectacular dive here again although not 
		as good as last year due to the &quot;fish bowl&quot; exit from the canyon being 
		considered unsafe because some of it had collapsed.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dive 216: Bells
		<font face="Times New Roman">&#8594; The Blue Hole</font><br>
		Spectacular entry through &quot;Bells&quot;, a 26m chimney, open to the sea most 
		of the way down except the last 2m. Drifted down past the Blue Hole and 
		then swam back before doing safety stop while swimming across it. A very 
		colourful dive with loads of small fish again</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the hotel by 3 and, after sorting out equipment and 
		showering, we made a start on the EFR course. This is a basic first aid 
		course which is a prerequisite of doing the Rescue Diver course. The 
		first part of this was a 90 minute video that we watched before retiring 
		to our room to complete the knowledge reviews. When these were complete, 
		we started on the Rescue Diver book. We only had one copy to save money 
		which meant Roz reading the first chapter, completing the knowledge 
		reviews and then passing the book on to me. The first chapter was 60 
		pages so this took up most of the rest of the evening. We ate at our 
		hotel restaurant, mainly to save time but the food was really good - 
		chicken balti, rice and popadoms. </p>
