		Monday, 
		21st August 2006</font> </b>Did not get up until about mid-day. We had 
		breakfast on the balcony and made it down to the beach by about 2. We 
		met up with everyone else on the beach and were back for a slightly 
		later start to the drinking by 6. A similar evening to last night but in 
		a different restaurant - this one with far quicker service. We returned 
		to the same bar we had been drinking in last night for a couple of hours 
		and were in there until at least 3am. Do not remember coming home.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		22nd August 2006</font> </b>An almost identical day to yesterday. We had 
		reserved a table so were able to eat on the roof-top bit of the 
		restaurant. Dave, Melissa and Ed left early as they get the ferry to 
		Naxos tomorrow. Did not make it to our usual bar as already pissed 
		enough when we left the restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0492.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		23rd August 2006</font> </b>Dave, Melissa and Ed all departed for Naxos 
		on the 7am ferry. The rest of us do not leave until tomorrow. Only Hoggy 
		and Sarah made it to the beach. We spent most of the day in our room 
		until 3ish when the six of us still here, set off to visit Hora. It was 
		a spectacular 30 minute bus journey to get to Hora. We were there for 
		about 3 hours, enough time to walk down to a monastery that is built 
		into the side of the cliff, walk back up the hill, get something to eat 
		and get the 6:45 bus back to Aegiali, where we are staying. We ate in 
		the same restaurant as we had done on the previous two nights but 
		without so much wine due to having an early start tomorrow. We were in 
		bed by 10.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		24th August 2006</font> </b>Due to a change in ferry schedules, the only 
		option for us to get to Naxos today was the 6am ferry from Katapola, 
		about 45 minutes by bus from where we were staying. Fortunately, there 
		was a bus departing at 4:30am from Aegiali so we had our earliest start 
		of the trip so far. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0504.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="right">The bus and ferry journey were uneventful 
		although the sun-rise was spectacular. We 
		arrived in Naxos at 9, about 20 minutes late. We were met by the minibus from Pension Sofi - 
		the same place that Dave, Melissa and Ed were staying at.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had a bit of a wait until the rooms were ready and 
		spent the time looking around the town (although Regan and Annette 
		inevitably ended up with the first room available again and went to 
		sleep). Our room is a studio apartment again and is probably the nicest 
		we have had in Greece. We had lunch on the balcony and then had a couple 
		of hours sleep to make up for the early start this morning.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0514.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="left">We 
		met up with Hoggy, Sarah, Dave &amp; Melissa at 4 and went for a walk around 
		the castle area of Naxos town, returned for showers and then all met up 
		on Ed's balcony/terrace for another session - the last with the Dave, 
		Hoggy and partners. The terrace was far better suited for us to sit 
		around drinking on than the ones in Amorgos had been and we stayed there 
		for almost three hours. A few of us were already quite pissed before we 
		went out to eat, myself included and only vaguely remember the latter 
		stages of the meal, although I do remember that it was excellent food 
		again. After a few litres of wine in the restaurant we headed for 
		another taverna where four of us stayed until 12:30 (The others were 
		either leaving early tomorrow or, in Ed's case, had already drank 
		enough).</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Friday, 
		25th August 2006</font> </b>By the time we woke up, Dave &amp; Melissa had 
		already departed for Athens and Hoggy and Sarah were on there way to 
		another island. We had breakfast on the balcony again then went off to 
		exchange books and check e-mail.</p>
		<p align="justify">We were joined by Ed at 1 and we got a bus up to 
		Halki, another picturesque village in the centre of the island. The 
		village was reasonably nice but not as spectacular as our book made out 
		and after a few pictures and a walk around a distillery, we did not have 
		too much to do before the 4:30 bus back to Naxos town. Spent the rest of 
		the time in a cafe with coffees and a diet coke.</p>
		<p align="justify">We were back in Naxos town just after 5. Ed returned 
		to his room, Roz went to use the internet for an hour and I went for a 
		walk around the Roman Arch near the port. The arch was not too 
		interesting itself but there were good views of Naxos from the hill it 
		stands on. The five of us ate in a different restaurant to last night 
		but again the food was excellent. Not too much alcohol consumed and a 
		relatively early night.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0577.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		26th August 2006</font> </b>We left the apartment at 11:20 to get the 
		12:10 ferry to Santorini. We arrived there at 2ish and got the bus 
		straight from the port to Fira, the main town on the island. We had 
		booked an apartment on the side of the caldera and we knew that we would 
		be getting rooms with good views and we were not disappointed. We are 
		high up on the caldera overlooking the volcano in the middle of it. The 
		room is excellent and the view from our balcony is one of the best we 
		have ever had. The place we are staying also has a pool with just as 
		good views.</p>
		<p align="justify">After an hour or so by the pool and a trip to the 
		supermarket for supplies, we spent a few hours on the balcony listening 
		to World Service (Orient 0, Swansea 1) and watching the sun set that 
		Santorini is famous for.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had started on the wine while watching the sun set 
		and continued in a taverna in the centre of Fira. Another good meal and 
		very enjoyable session. Got to bed after 2am.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>

		27th August 2006</font> </b>Regan, Annette and Ed all went on a boat 
		trip to the volcano in the centre of the caldera and the hot springs 
		there. Roz and I could not be bothered as we are happy spending the time 
		on our balcony or at the pool. We did go for a walk down to the old port 
		during the hottest part of the day, the return trip almost killing Roz! 
		On our return, we had lunch and spent another hour or two at the pool. 
		None of the others were particularly enthusiastic about their trip when 
		they returned so it looked as if we made the right decision.</p>
		<p align="justify">Had another evening of watching the sun setting from 
		our balcony while consuming wine or retsina. We had booked a table in 
		the taverna that we ate in yesterday and stayed in there from about 9 
		until gone 1.</p>
