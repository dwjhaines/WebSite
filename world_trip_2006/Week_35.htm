		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 5th February 2007</font> </b>We were up at 7 for breakfast and 
		then checked out of Kaw Kwang, almost certainly for the last time on 
		this trip. The 28 nights we have stayed here have been excellent and I 
		doubt we will stay anywhere in Thailand that is as good value. As was 
		the case six years ago, it was quite sad to be leaving.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had booked minibus tickets to get us to Khao Lak where we will join a 
		4 night live-aboard tomorrow evening. The first part of the journey to 
		Krabi was pretty good as instead of a minibus, we had a private car. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0689.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Despite waiting over an hour for the ferry to take us across to the 
		mainland, we were in Krabi by about 10:15. We were supposed to get 
		another minibus at 11 from Krabi for the rest of the journey. When it 
		turned up, another couple managed to get in but we were told it was full 
		and we had to wait for another at 11:30. When we complained, the staff 
		became abusive and just laughed when we asked for our money back. These 
		were probably the most unpleasant people we have come across in all our 
		years of travelling in Thailand and we will certainly try and avoid 
		using the same company again. We expect a certain amount of messing 
		around with any Thai minibus journey but these blokes were complete and 
		utter wankers.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were picked up fairly quickly while the arguments were still ongoing 
		and were taken to another office for the 11:30 departure. This also 
		seemed to be overbooked but we got seats and eventually left Krabi just 
		after midday. We arrived in Khao Lak at 2:30 and were dropped at the Sea 
		Dragon office. We booked a days diving with them for tomorrow and they 
		booked us a room at a guest house about 50m away.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We spent an hour or so walking around Khao Lak which seemed nice enough apart 
		from the busy main road running through the centre of it. We did not 
		regret our decision to stay the extra nights in Lanta and will almost 
		certainly not return to Khao Lak after the live-aboard.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out at Khao Lak Seafood which had been recommended by the same 
		person that had recommended Sea Dragon. Excellent food again and our 
		first wheat beers since Chiang Mai.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0788.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 6th February 2007</font> </b>
		We did not have breakfast included with our room so got up and went to 
		the supermarket for tuna sandwiches. We checked out of the guest house 
		and carried all our luggage to the dive centre. We were introduced to 
		our dm - Marika - and at about 9:45 set off to the dive site.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was a 20 minute drive to the beach that the long-tail boat departed 
		from and a 20 minute boat journey from there. The boat was really good 
		to dive from as there were only the three of us on it so we all had 
		plenty of space. The dives were both at the wreck of an old tin mining 
		ship. Both dives were excellent with large schools of fish all around us 
		and loads of interesting stuff to look at.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the dive centre by about 4 and killed time for a couple 
		of hours before getting a taxi out to Tab Lamu pier. West Coast Explorer 
		was already at the pier. We got our stuff aboard and waited for everyone 
		else to arrive. All the other customers were aboard by about 8:30 and we 
		were shown to our usual cabin at the front of the boat. Milton turned up 
		30 minutes later and we left the pier at about 9:30. We found out that 
		we would be diving with Milton again which was good news and retired to 
		our cabin at 10:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 7th February 2007</font> </b>
		Roz's Birthday! We woke at 7ish and Roz opened her underwater camera 
		case and new camera. It was a relatively late start to the day with the 
		first dive not until 9am. As well as Milton, there was one other diver 
		in our group, Thomas from Germany. It was a very enjoyable days diving - 
		see log book for details - with day dives at 9, 12 &amp; 3 and a night dive 
		at 7.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We celebrated Roz's birthday with a can of diet coke! The most sober 
		birthday for a long time but an excellent day anyway.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0833.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"><font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		8th February 2007</font> </b>A similar day to yesterday. The highlight 
		of the day was the mantas that featured on all of the day dives. We were 
		about the only group that did not see them on the first dive but had two 
		brief sightings on the second. On the third, there seemed to be mantas 
		everywhere and we kept seeing them all through the dive. The night dive 
		was pretty boring but other than that, it was another very 
		enjoyable days diving.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 9th February 2007</font> </b>The first two 
		dives of the day were both at Richelieu Rock and were superb. The 
		visibility was pretty good, the best they have had in the last couple of 
		months apparently. We saw sea-horses and ghost pipe fish on both dives 
		and really nice schools of fish all over the dive site. </p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0179.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">On 
		the second dive during the safety stop, we saw our first ever whale 
		shark! It was only a couple of metres long but a spectacular sight 
		anyway. It swam around us a couple of times coming very close for 
		pictures before swimming off. We had started to think that we were never 
		going to see a whale shark as we have come close so many times but 
		always missed out so this was a real highlight of the trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were keen to do a third dive at the same sight but seemed to get 
		outvoted somehow so we headed South to Koh Tachai for the third dive. 
		This was no-where near as good as the previous ones but was more 
		enjoyable than last years at the same spot!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The night dive was the best of this trip as there was actually things to 
		see! There were a couple of mating octopus at the start of the dive 
		which Roz, Thomas and I spent about 5 - 10 minutes watching before 
		catching up with the rest of our group. Also saw a tiny lobster, a 
		couple of zebra morays and a massive crab.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Two excellent dives to end the trip - both at Koh Bon due to the amount 
		of mantas that have been there recently. We saw 4 or 5 on the first 
		dive as well as a leopard shark and then spent about an hour with them 
		swimming around us on the second dive.
		There 
		did not appear to be as many as on the dive we did here last year but 
		that may just have been due to the vis being not quite as good. Either 
		way, it was another fantastic experience and one of the best dives we 
		have ever done.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		This marked the end of the trip and it had been every bit as good as the 
		previous ones we have done to the Similans. It had been a pretty good 
		group of people again, the food was good and the diving possibly better 
		than on previous trips. We will almost certainly go again next year!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0707.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		were back at the pier by 3 and dropped in Kata at about 5:30. We checked 
		into The Little Mermaid which we had booked previously by phone. Not 
		quite Pop Cottages but a nice enough room anyway for the money.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a couple of drinks while Roz opened the remainder of her birthday 
		presents and then went out to eat. Coconut restaurant, where we used to 
		eat had disappointingly changed hands and was no-where near as good so 
		we ate at a place further up the same road. We had a bottle of Sang Som 
		with our meal and another while watching football in another 
		restaurant/bar. Don't really remember getting back to the room!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 11th February 2007</font> </b>
		A day of not doing a lot except planning what we are to do in the next 
		few days. We looked round a couple of dive shops in Kata but the prices 
		seemed to be a lot higher than in Lanta and there did not seem any ideal 
		trips for tomorrow. We eventually decided to leave for Phi Phi on 
		Wednesday and do a days diving with West Coast on Tuesday. This will 
		give us tomorrow to go into Phuket town to go to the post office, book 
		shop, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Most of the rest of the day spent using internet, sorting out photos 
		from the Similans, etc. We had a few beers with our evening meal and 
		another couple back in the room. We had not planned to get drunk but 
		when we finished the beer, we started on the Sang Som and got through 
		almost two bottles. Don't remember going to bed for the second night 
		running.</p>
