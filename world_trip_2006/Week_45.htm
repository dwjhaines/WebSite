		breakfast on our balcony as it is not included in our room rate. Spent a 
		few hours by the pool and an hour or so on the internet in the evening. 
		We went out to Easy Divers but decided that we would probably not bother 
		diving while we were here due to the prices and the fact that we have 
		plenty of diving ahead of us in the next few weeks. Definitely in need of a day off alcohol and 
		an early night!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 17th April 2007</font> </b>
		Day spent mainly by the pool again. We had planned a session for the 
		evening. We had a few drinks on the balcony again and ate at Landhaus 
		but the session got interrupted by an argument and came to an early end!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Another quiet day spent sun bathing and not really doing a lot else. We 
		did go for a walk in the evening to have a look at the area where Palm 
		Resort used to be. The resort has been flattened and replaced with an 
		upmarket hotel and is unrecognisable from when we first stayed there. 
		The original Kokila restaurant has also been flattened and replaced by a 
		massage parlour!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked back through Lamai photographing some more places that we used 
		to visit regularly but have now been knocked down, closed down or simply 
		changed for the worse.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Ate out at a restaurant on the beach - something that we have never done 
		much in Lamai for some reason. Given the number of our old eating places 
		that have closed or disappeared, this proved to be a far better option 
		than eating Thai food in the centre of Lamai.</p>

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_3053.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 19th April 2007</font> </b>
		A similar day to the previous ones! Apart from an hour or so when we 
		went out to use the internet and buy books we remained by the pool most 
		of the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had our &quot;leaving Lamai&quot; session in the evening. Usual sort of thing - 
		drinks on our balcony, Sang Som with our meal on the beach and a lot 
		more beer than we had planned to consume at Landhaus.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Coming to Samui again has been a really good move and the Firefly 
		flights have been ideal. Despite all the changes here, we have still 
		enjoyed ourselves and would consider coming back again when on a two 
		week holiday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 20th April 2007</font> </b>Not too hung-over 
		for our journey back to Penang. An uneventful journey - taxi to the 
		airport, flight left 20 minutes early at midday with a total of 9 
		passengers on board, taxi from airport to Bay View Hotel in Penang. Did 
		not do a lot for the rest of the day except eat and make use of the 
		internet in the room which we may be getting without having to pay.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 21st April 2007</font>
		</b>Spent most of the day trying, unsuccessfully to purchase a camera 
		and underwater housing for my birthday. After our visit here last week, 
		we thought that this would be a relatively easy task as we had enquired 
		about what was available. We had chosen the camera and case that we 
		wanted and had been given the price. However, when we went to buy the 
		camera, the case was not in fact available. A few shops had underwater 
		cases available but all for older models of camera that were no longer 
		stocked. We had just about given up but after a search on the internet, 
		we went and looked at another couple of shops. We found one that could 
		sell us a camera that I was keen on and the case. We got as far as 
		paying a deposit and walking to a bank to get out the money but when we 
		returned to the shop, we were told that there was a problem with the 
		case and there was no other one available. We got back our deposit and 
		gave up for the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We decided that we would try again in KL on Monday. This would mean 
		getting an early bus instead of flying but as we do not have much else 
		to do all day this seemed a reasonable option. We rang a couple of 
		places that said that they could help us but we will head to the 
		shopping malls and see what is really available.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		This took us most of the day and we were ready for a few drinks again. 
		We had bought another bottle of Bacardi when we arrived from Thailand 
		and we started on this before going out to eat. We ate in our usual 
		curry house and then went for a couple of beers in a bar showing Spurs v 
		Arsenal. We returned to the room and continued to drink the Bacardi 
		while watching the football and listening to Gillette Soccer Saturday on 
		the laptop (Swansea 2, Brighton 1).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 22nd April 2007</font>
		</b>Another day of not doing a lot apart from eating and using the 
		internet. We had been thinking of visiting East Timor while in Indonesia 
		but found out that the FO advise strongly against travel there at the 
		moment. We started looking into other options but are still waiting to 
		find out about live-aboard options so can not plan anything definite 
		yet. We did book bus tickets to KL for tomorrow morning at 7:30. This 
		will give us a few hours to look for cameras before we fly out to Tawau</p>
