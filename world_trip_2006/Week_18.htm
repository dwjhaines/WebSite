		Monday, 9th October 2006</font> </b>We were up at 3:40am and were on our 
		way to Luton Airport by 4. It was an un eventful drive down and we were 
		parked at the off-site parking by about 5:30. We got the shuttle bus to 
		the airport and were checked in with well over an hour to spare. We had 
		been concerned about WizzAir who we were flying with but everything 
		seemed reasonably efficient at check-in and the plane departed just 
		about on time. The plane was not full so it was a comfortable flight and 
		we landed in Zagreb at about 11:40. We only had hand luggage with us so 
		were straight through the airport in about 10 minutes and were able to 
		get the 12:00 shuttle bus into Zagreb. We were at the bus station at 
		12:30. We had no accommodation booked for the first two nights of our 
		stay here and were not 100% sure of what we were going to do. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7359.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">At the bus 
		station, we found that we could get a bus at 1pm to Vara<font face="Times New Roman">ž</font>din 
		which had a pretty good write-up in Lonely Planet. It took just under two 
		hours to get to Vara<font face="Times New Roman">ž</font>din and by just 
		after 3, we were checked into a hotel near the bus station.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We spent most of the rest of the afternoon catching up on sleep although 
		I did go for a short walk around the old town which seemed quite 
		pleasant. We were both still tired when we went out to eat. We were not 
		bothered about drinking too much and as most of the bars seemed a bit 
		trendy for us, we settled on a pizza and an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 10th October 2006</font> </b>
		After a week with a few early starts and quite a bit of travelling, we 
		slept for about 10 hours and woke up feeling better for it. We had 
		breakfast in the hotel and then headed off to see the sights of Vara<font face="Times New Roman">ž</font>din. 
		It was a nice enough place to wander around, similar to small towns in 
		Austria or Slovenia, neither of which are far away. Lonely Planet 
		describe it as a mini Prague - again, a bit of an exaggeration but an 
		enjoyable place to wander around nevertheless. After a couple of hours 
		looking at old buildings, we spent an hour in the library looking at the 
		internet before getting takeaways for lunch. Spent most of the afternoon 
		back in the hotel not doing a lot.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We drank a litre of red wine in the room before going out for tea. We 
		returned to the same restaurants we had eaten in last night and had 
		another couple of litres of wine with our pizzas. Only vaguely remember 
		returning to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 11th October 2006</font> </b>
		Woke with slight hangovers, had breakfast and walked to the bus station 
		for the 8:50 bus back to Zagreb. The bus got in at about 10:20 and we 
		walked from the bus station to our hotel. We checked in straight away 
		and were in our room before 11. While waiting for Mark and Steve to turn 
		up, we walked out to the hotel where the FA were based to register our 
		proof of travel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Croatia_023.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">Mark 
		and Steve appeared at about 12:30 and we left the hotel about 45 minutes 
		later. We walked up to the main square where we met a couple of Steve's 
		friends and then went to one of the bars in the Upper Town. Totally by 
		chance, we managed to find a bar that had an excellent range of good, 
		cheap beers and spent the remainder of the afternoon there.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At 5 o'clock, two hours before kick-off, we started making our way 
		towards the ground. Me, Roz and Mark managed to get separated from the 
		others in the main square but the three of us got on a tram fairly 
		quickly for the 20 minute journey to the ground. We were at the ground 
		by about 5:45 so went for another pint before going in (Steve and his 
		mates got there after us and went straight into the ground).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We left for the ground at about 6:15. There were big queues at the first 
		checkpoint but the queues were moving and we probably would have made 
		kick-off without any problems. However, with about 20 minutes to go 
		until kick-off, the stewards decided to throw open the gates at the 
		checkpoint and let everyone in without searches or ticket checks. This 
		seemed like a good idea, but instead it just caused a huge bottleneck at 
		the next checkpoint. This was a single gateway for all the England fans 
		to enter their terrace and was not big enough to cope with the number of 
		fans trying to get in. Their was the usual pushing and shoving and 
		eventually, the riot police waded in swinging batons in an attempt to 
		calm things down. This inevitably made matters worse and things were not 
		helped by the fact that they had stopped letting in any fans at all. It 
		was a very unpleasant 20 minutes and it looked as it could of all turned 
		very nasty.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Croatia_030.JPG" width="273" height="173" align="left">We 
		stayed back from the trouble and eventually got pushed through some 
		barriers into a no-man's land between our entrance and the media 
		entrance. We could not get into the ground but we were away from the 
		trouble and safe. Although we were not supposed to be there, the 
		stewards saw some sense and let us and a handful of other fans remain 
		where we were until the trouble had calmed down. Eventually they started 
		letting us into the ground. We remained at the back to avoid the crowds 
		and got into the ground about 20 minutes into the first half. We found 
		Steve and his mates about 10 minutes later and were reunited with Mark 
		at half-time.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The game itself was pretty poor and the 2 - 0 score-line was a fair 
		result. England could easily of lost by more. We were kept in the ground 
		for about 40 minutes after the game. By the time we were allowed out, 
		there were hardly any trams running and those that were about were, were 
		already full by the time they had reached our stop. We gave up and went 
		for a drink and got a later tram after the crowds had died down. We had 
		to put up with the Croat celebrations all the way back and in the main 
		square but it was all fairly good-natured. We went for one more drink in 
		the bar we had been in earlier but the whole place seemed to close down 
		around midnight so we returned to the hotel.</p>

		There was not too much that any of us wanted to do in Zagreb so we 
		decided on a day trip to Samobor. We all walked to the bus station and 
		got tickets for the 11:55 bus. We were told that the journey was 30 
		minutes but it took well over an hour and we did not get to Samobor 
		until after 1. Samobor was another picturesque little town near the 
		Slovenian border. We spent an hour or so wandering round the centre of 
		the town and another hour or so sitting in bars with a couple of beers. 
		It was another place that was not overly spectacular but a nice enough 
		way of spending the day. We got a bus back to Zagreb just before 5 and 
		after showers at the hotel returned to where we had been drinking 
		yesterday. We spent most of the evening in the same bar as yesterday 
		apart from a trip to a pizza restaurant where we had eaten on our trip 
		to Zagreb five years ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 13th October 2006</font> </b>The four of us 
		got a taxi from the hotel to the airport at 10am. We checked in for the 
		11:55 flight without any problems but then had to wait in the departure 
		lounge for a few hours as the flight was nearly two hours late leaving. 
		Eventually got back into Luton at 2:45. We said goodbye to Mark and 
		Steve and got straight on the bus to collect the car. Had a better than 
		expected journey North and were Hoggy's house in Sheffield just after 6. 
		Regan was already there and after a couple of beers in the house, spent 
		the rest of the night in the local pub.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 14th October 2006</font> </b>
		I went to Chesterfield by train to watch Swansea win 3 - 2. Roz drove to 
		Preston to see Sunderland lose 4 - 1. Met up with Hoggy, Sarah and Regan 
		in Sheffield for the session.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 15th October 2006</font> </b>
		Took Regan back to Wheatley and drove from there to Aleks and Andi's. 
		Had another curry and got through about 6 or 7 bottles of wine!</p>
