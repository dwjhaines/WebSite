		Monday, 2nd April 2007</font> </b>We did our third mapping trip to Batee 
		Tokong in the morning. Poor vis and strong currents made mapping 
		difficult again but I think we now have enough information to complete 
		our map. For the second dive, Roz and I took three customers to Rubiah 
		Sea Garden.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Roz appears to be suffering from a ringworm type skin infection. After consultations with both Mette and Peter 
		she has started taking antibiotics that are leftover from Tsunami Aid!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		3rd April 2007</font> </b>We managed to get a couple more things ticked 
		off towards our DM course today. I spent an hour or so in the morning 
		being the victim for Peter who was completing his rescue course with 
		Mette. I was recovered from the bottom a few times and then towed to the 
		shore while being resuscitated, etc. Roz had not been feeling well when 
		we got up due to a combination of the infection and the antibiotics but 
		she made it into the water for us to complete the rescue assessment that 
		we needed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After lunch I was again the victim while Peter looked for a missing, 
		unconscious diver and we then had the enjoyment of our stress test. This 
		involved me and Roz having to swap fins, BCD's and masks underwater 
		while buddy breathing. David &quot;helped&quot; by switching off our air and 
		undoing tank straps. This all went reasonably well and once completed 
		means that we only have a few skills left to demonstrate and our map to 
		complete to successfully finish the course.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the stress test, we spent a more relaxing 50 minutes diving with 
		David around the beach.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_2715.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right"><font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 4th April 2007</font> </b>
		My day on shop duty so I stayed on my own while everyone else went off 
		to Arus Paleh. Roz went with David and two customers, Wilco and Alesha, 
		who were all doing their deep check. This involved going down to 45m and 
		ensuring that there were no problems and is always done before a trip to 
		the deep wreck. Wilco and Alesha along with Cedric and Diane are all 
		booked to go to the wreck tomorrow</p>
		<p align="justify">
		While everyone was away, I made quite a bit of progress 
		on the map that I am trying to draw with Photoshop. Should have it 
		finished after one more mapping dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the afternoon, we went back into the water with David and completed 
		our skill circuit. Roz had three more skills remaining than me but we 
		both completed everything without too many problems. With these done, 
		our course is almost complete - we just have to finish our mapping and 
		get ourselves certified fit to dive by the local doctor. After our 
		skills, we spent an hour or so diving at the beach with David and also 
		went back out again for a night dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Cedric and Diane had both pulled out of the trip to the deep wreck by 
		departure time meaning that there were now two spaces. Roz was able to 
		go as she had been on the deep check. Because I had not done the deep 
		dive yesterday, I was not able to go. This was annoying as I was keen to 
		go to the wreck and if I had known that Cedric and Diane were not going, 
		I would have made more of an effort to have done the deep check. I spent 
		most of the day in the shop again and started reading a book for the 
		first time since we arrived here.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I did go out for a dive from the beach again in the afternoon with Luca 
		and Flo. This was quite good again as we saw a couple of sea moths and 
		the ornate ghost pipe fish again but it did not sound as good as the 
		deep wreck.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Eleven of us went to eat at Mama Jungle's again in the evening but she 
		doubled the price of the meal for some reason so we will probably not be 
		going back there again!</p>

		We both did the two boat dives today. The first was at Batee Tokong 
		where we just about finished our mapping exercise. It was mainly a fun 
		dive with a few rocks marked out on the plateau. I should be able to 
		finish the map with what we have which will complete our course.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The second dive did not go quite as well. Roz led the dive at Arus Paleh 
		with three customers as well as me and Luca. It went OK until we reached 
		the channel. At the channel, the current was as strong as anything we 
		have experienced here. The customers all went too high and started going 
		all over the place. As we tried to catch up with them, I got my SPG 
		caught in some coral and could not get free. The current made it just 
		about impossible to turn round to see what was caught and I remained 
		stuck until one of the customers managed to free me. Roz also had 
		problems with a customer whose SPG used psi and who could not correctly 
		convert into bar. This caused communication problems and confusion 
		between all concerned. However, we all made it safely back to the boat 
		and everyone except Roz seemed to enjoy themselves.</p>

		We could not go on the first boat trip of the day as the boat was full 
		and we had never been to the site before so were unable to guide. Spent 
		most of the morning reading at the dive centre. We went on the second 
		trip - to Batee Tokong again. This went OK. I was leading Cedric and 
		Diane with one other customer (the one who had rescued me yesterday) and 
		Roz. The dive was not great due to poor vis and strong currents. When we 
		returned to the dive centre, we found out that we were not able to go on 
		the third dive to the Sabang Wreck due to David thinking that too many 
		customers there would spoil the dive for the customers. This did not 
		seem to make much sense and Roz in particular was not very happy.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At this point, Roz decided that she just wanted to leave. We had spent 
		all day at the dive centre for the sake of one pretty average dive. We 
		are here for the diving but spending much more time here for days like 
		today is pretty much a waste of the time we have remaining in SE Asia. I 
		agreed that it would be a good idea to leave a week or so earlier than 
		we had planned.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We spent the remainder of the afternoon on our balcony and returned to 
		the dive centre after 6. We got David to sign off our map and told him 
		that we were keen to leave early. We had a bit of an argument about a 
		few things, including the dive to Arus Paleh yesterday, and we were told 
		that we are going to have to have at least one more attempt at 
		supervised guiding before being signed off as DM's. Roz was happy to 
		take a referral but after further conversation with David and Mette we 
		agreed that we would do the supervised guiding in the next couple of 
		days, complete the course and depart on Wednesday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time all this was sorted out, we were ready for our first beers 
		in 5<font face="Times New Roman">½ weeks. We drank the last four cans at 
		the dive centre and returned to the room to listen to the football on 
		World Service (Bristol City 0 Swansea 0).</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		8th April 2007</font> </b>We got to go on all three boat trips today. I 
		did my supervised guiding at the canyon with David plus Mario and Sven. 
		This all went OK but I am still not sure if this means I have finished and can 
		be signed off yet. Roz led the second dive at Rubiah Sea Garden, also 
		with Mario and Sven. This was not supervised but was her first attempt 
		at guiding since Arus Paleh. Although very nervous about guiding again, 
		this also went OK so she should now be OK for supervised guiding 
		tomorrow. The third was basically a fun dive at Batee Tokong which we 
		did in different groups.</p>
