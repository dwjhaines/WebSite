		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0471.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">Day 29 - 
		5th July 2006</font> </b>We picked up our bikes from the station and, 
		after sorting out a couple of problems with the panniers and Roz's bike, we 
		headed out of Regensburg along the Donauradweg about an hour later. We 
		stopped in Straubing for lunch and then continued on to Deggendorf where 
		we arrived at about 6ish. This meant that we had done 88 of the 152km to 
		Passau, leaving 64km for tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Day 30 - 6th July 2006</font> </b>We set off after breakfast at about 9 
		and things were going quite smoothly until Roz fell off her bike while 
		trying to get from the road onto the pavement. She was quite shaken by 
		the fall and had several grazes as well as hurting her wrist, shoulder 
		and getting a bump on the head. We had about a 20 minute wait until she 
		was able to get on her bike again and it did not look as if we were 
		going to make it all the way to Passau. After another hour or so, she 
		had just about recovered and we were able to complete the trip by about 
		2pm. The last 30 - 40 km was probably the best part of the whole journey 
		as the cycle path was alongside the river so we had spectacular views as 
		we cycled.</p>

		<p align="justify">After finding a hotel room and having much needed 
		showers, we combined some sight-seeing with some visits to beer gardens. 
		Passau was a really nice place with plenty to see and some excellent 
		places to drink. Although we had intended to go back to the hotel before 
		going out for the evening, we ended up staying out until about 11.</p>
		<p align="justify">Roz now has a swollen black eye from her accident.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Day 31 - 7th July 2006</font> </b>We had another walk around the sights 
		after breakfast, this time going into the cathedral which was 
		particularly impressive. We got the 11:13 train back to Regensburg and 
		returned our bikes before checking back into the Ibis near the station. 
		After a few hours sleep, we headed off to a couple of beer gardens 
		again. After we had had a few drinks, the idea of visiting Munich on the 
		way home started to appeal. We stayed in beer gardens until it started 
		to rain and then revisited a place that we had eaten in a couple of 
		times when we visited Regensburg three years ago. Don't really remember 
		getting back to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0517.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">Day 32 - 
		8th July 2006</font> </b>We were still keen on Munich when we woke up. 
		We phoned the Jedermann and found that they had returned to normal 
		booking conditions following the world cup, so we booked a double room, 
		had breakfast and headed South. The journey took about two hours 
		including a stop for photographs at The Allianz Arena which is right 
		next to the motorway.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0548.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">We 
		checked into the hotel and headed off on a tour of some of our favourite 
		beer gardens and beer halls from previous visits. We started by walking 
		to the Viktualienmarkt before heading back to the Augustiner beer garden 
		via the Augustiner-Grossgastst<font face="Times New Roman">ätt. We 
		returned to the hotel for showers before going out again to four beer 
		halls, spending most of our time just round the corner from the 
		Marianplatz due to them showing the third place play-off on a big 
		screen. Things are very vague in my memory after leaving there but we 
		went for one in the Schneider Weisse Hall (empty due to no TV) and one 
		more over the road from there before staggering back to the hotel.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Day 33 - 9th July 2006</font> </b>Our trip to Munich meant that we had 
		slightly more driving to do to get back to Belgium and we got most of it 
		out of the way today. It was a long day in the car - about six and a 
		half hours including a lunch stop - and we arrived in Bonn at about 
		5:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">We had a quick look round the sights and then went to 
		an Italian pizza restaurant, across the road from our hotel to watch the 
		World Cup Final. The atmosphere in there was excellent and although I 
		was totally knackered and desperately in need of sleep, it turned into 
		an enjoyable evening.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Germany_0564.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">Day 34 - 10th July 2006</font> </b>
		It took us a couple of hours to drive to Ghent and we found the Ibis 
		remarkably easily. We managed to not start drinking until about 4ish 
		when we made our way to Het Waterhuis. We had a couple in there before 
		going to t Galgenhuisje, ticking off plenty more of my 300 beers. We 
		were already getting quite drunk when we returned to the hotel for 
		showers and we then went out to The Trappistenhuis where we stayed for 
		the remainder of the evening.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Day 35 - 11th July 2006</font> </b>We got a train to Bruges at about 
		midday and arrived there by 12:30. We started doing part of the Lonely 
		Planet walking tour and soon found ourselves at the &quot;Straffen Hendrik&quot; 
		brewery. We did the tour which was reasonably interesting and had our 
		first beer of the day in the tasting room. We continued walking round 
		the sights. We spent a couple of hours in De Garre, another excellent 
		bar, recommended by Lonely Planet and wandered around some of the sights 
		before heading back to Ghent on the 18:03 train. Once in Ghent, we 
		walked to the Hop Duvel and then back to our usual pizza restaurant. 
		Stopped drinking relatively early at about 11pm.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Day 36 - 12th July 2006</font> </b>Left the hotel at 10 and drove back 
		to Calais making two stops along the way. We called in to the Hop Duvel 
		bottle shop and also at the Sint Sixtus Abbey, the only place in the 
		world where you can purchase Westveleteren Trappist beer. Got to Calais 
		in time for the 14:00 ferry and where back in Dover by 14:30.</p>
