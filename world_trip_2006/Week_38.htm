		<b><font size="4">
		Monday, 
		26th February 2007</font> </b>A days diving with Forra Divers which was 
		a bit like a cross between diving in Zanzibar and diving in Koh Chang. 
		We arrived at the dive just after 9:30 and were told that due to 
		problems with boat/compressor we would only be able to do two dives 
		today. The boat was going to be going to a different place to where we 
		had been told it would be going and we would have to sit out one of the 
		dives due to a shortage of full tanks. We were not overjoyed with this 
		but said we would miss out on the first wreck dive and do the other two. 
		This seemed to cause them more problems for some reason as they expected 
		us to do the wreck dive and one other.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After about an hour of sitting around waiting we were taken by long-tail 
		to the dive boat which appeared too small for the amount of divers on 
		it. We were told however that we would now be able to do all three 
		dives. We dived with a French instructor and one French customer at the 
		first site. This was a wreck sitting on its side at about 40m. This was 
		the deepest dive we had ever done and the vis was crap. I almost 
		panicked completely as we went down through 31 - 32m and lost sight of 
		the others in the group, but managed to sort myself to continue going 
		down. We went down to 39m and swam through parts of the wreck for 10 
		minutes or so and then along the side at 30m for another 10 minutes. We 
		then spent 10 minutes going up the buoy line and doing a safety stop.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2494.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">The second and third dives were more normal dives but we were joined by 
		two divers completing their open water courses. Both these dives were OK 
		without being too spectacular. Saw plenty of small stuff - nudibranchs, 
		ghost pipe fish, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back on Lipe by 5, returned to our room and tried to decide our 
		route to Penang where we have to be on Wednesday afternoon. Option 1 was 
		to spend the day on the beach tomorrow and get the 4pm ferry to Langkawi, 
		from where we could get another ferry direct to Penang on Wednesday. 
		Option 2 was a return to Pak Bara and a night in Hat Yai with a bus 
		journey over the border and down to Penang. We eventually chose the 
		second option as it means one more night in Thailand and should work out 
		slightly cheaper.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out and bought our boat/mini-bus tickets for tomorrow and ate 
		out at our resorts restaurant again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		27th February 2007</font> </b>Our journey to Hat Yai went about as well 
		as we could of hoped for. We were taken by long-tail to the ferry at 
		9:30. The ferry left just after 10 and got to Pak Bara three hours 
		later. We got straight onto the waiting minibus at Pak Bara and were in 
		Hat Yai by 4.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_1226.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		checked in to a Guest House near the train station as this was where we 
		were dropped and train was one of our options for getting to Penang 
		tomorrow. The train times were not ideal so we walked out to the bus 
		station to see if there were any direct buses. There was nothing of much 
		use so reluctantly, we booked ourselves onto the 9am minibus direct to 
		Georgetown.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out to eat at 7 and ended up in an air-con English type pub due 
		to the lack of other options. The food here was surprisingly good and we 
		ended up drinking a lot more than we had intended to. There was a happy 
		hour when we arrived with cheap litre jugs of Chang. By the time we had 
		got through three of these, happy hour had finished and we moved on to 
		the Sang Som for a final time. We had a couple of bottles before 
		staggering back to the guest house with Roz in particular fairly pissed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		28th February 2007</font> </b>Another day when the travelling went 
		surprisingly smoothly. We were up at about 8 feeling decidedly rough 
		after too much alcohol and not enough sleep. The mini-bus office was 
		just round the corner form the guest house so we walked there and had 
		breakfast next door while we waited to be picked up. We left just after 
		9 and left crossed into Malaysia about 90 minutes later. By 2pm 
		Malaysian time, we had arrived in Georgetown on Penang. We walked from 
		where the mini-bus dropped us to our hotel where we checked into a huge 
		room with an excellent view of the sea. It all felt very luxurious after 
		the last few days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0797.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"></b></font>We 
		walked from the hotel to the Komtar Tower and found the travel agent 
		that we had booked our Penang - Medan flights with and collected our 
		tickets with no problems. We were both still not feeling 100% so went to 
		McDonalds for lunch which just about sorted us out! We walked back via 
		the main backpacker area of town and spent a bit of time looking at 
		second hand books and photocopying the documents that we need for our 
		Indonesian visas tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel we paid for 24 hours of internet access so we could 
		start sorting out flights, etc for the last part of our trip. We had 
		found reasonably priced flights back to Germany from Bangkok. This means 
		that we will not use our return tickets with Royal Jordanian and will 
		have an overnight stopover in Düsseldorf instead of 8 hours waiting 
		around in Amman. The main reason for doing this is that it gives us an 
		extra week in SE Asia before flying home.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out in Little India at a restaurant recommend by Anjali and were 
		back in the hotel by 9ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		1st March 2007</font> </b>After breakfast, we got a taxi out to the 
		Indonesian Consulate. Applying for the visa was very straightforward. We 
		filled out the form (twice), and handed over our photocopies, RM135 
		(about £20) each, and our passports. In theory we should be able to 
		collect the passports with visas tomorrow at 3.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0798.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We got the bus back to the Komtar but most shops were still closed so we 
		walked back to the hotel. We booked a few more things on the internet - 
		flights home from Düsseldorf, accommodation in Düsseldorf, car hire, 
		flights home from Latvia, etc. I left Roz using the laptop while I went 
		off to get my haircut and look round the shops. We went out for roti chani for lunch and then Roz went to the pool while I had my turn with 
		the internet.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At 5ish, Roz got an e-mail which was to cause another change to our 
		plans. She had enquired about staying at the Borneo Divers resort on 
		Mabul Island near Sipidan at the end of May. We had intended that our 
		visit to Sipidan would be the last thing that we would do before flying 
		back to England and Borneo Divers are the operator with by far the best 
		reputation for diving there. The e-mail told us that they were full on 
		the 27th May meaning that we would have to leave earlier than we had 
		hoped. This would waste a lot of the week we had gained by buying our 
		flights back to Germany. We sent an e-mail enquiring about other dates 
		and also e-mailed a couple of other operators and Roz considered missing 
		out on Sipidan altogether.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We continued working our way through the shopping list we had for things 
		we needed for Palau Weh and ate out at the same restaurant as last 
		night. We bought a Malaysian SIM card that allowed phone calls home for 
		3p a minute!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 2nd March 2007</font> </b>Spent most of the 
		morning trying to sort out the last month of our time in S.E. Asia. Roz 
		spoke to Borneo Divers and found that they had spaces at the end of 
		April from 24th to 29th. This would mean that we would have to leave Pulau Weh on the 22nd giving us seven weeks to complete our 
		DM training. I 
		had hoped to have the option of staying until our visa runs out if we 
		really liked it there but this only shortens our stay by a few days and 
		means that we can go to Sipidan and still have a month for Bali and the 
		rest of Indonesia.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We contacted Borneo Divers again and confirmed that we would go on the 
		dates that they had offered. Roz spent the rest of the morning looking 
		at flight options for getting from Penang to Sipidan and then to Bali 
		while I walked to the post office to send home postcards, CDs, etc.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0803.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">When 
		I got back to the room, we booked the four flights required and also 
		sorted out car hire for when we get back to the UK. We had certainly got 
		our moneys worth from the 48 hours internet access we had paid for.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out for lunch (roti chani again) and then got a bus out to the 
		Indonesian Consulate to collect our passports. There were loads of 
		people there when we arrived but as with yesterday, we went to the front 
		of a different queue and got our passports with visas in a few minutes. 
		We finished our shopping and returned to the hotel.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We made the most of the last few hours of our internet access and went 
		out to eat at Sri Ananda Bahwan for the third night in a row.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 3rd March 2007</font> </b>Checked out of the 
		hotel at 7:30 and got a taxi to the airport. The 9:30 Adam Air flight to 
		Medan was on time and we arrived in Medan at 9:25 Indonesian time. As 
		soon as we were through immigration we were met by Mr Nadjri with our 
		onward tickets to Banda Aceh. We walked to the domestic terminal with 
		him so we could get money from the ATM to pay him and than sat around 
		waiting for the 1:10 flight. This eventually left one hour late but we 
		still got out of the airport in Banda Aceh with our luggage by 3:10, 
		giving us just enough time to get the last fast boat of the day to Pulau 
		Weh. We were in Pulau Weh by 5 and had an hour in a minibus to our final 
		destination at Gapang Beach.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were dropped near the Lumba Lumba dive centre where we met some of 
		the staff and were shown around. We got into one of the bungalows near 
		the dive centre but can only stay a few nights as it is booked later in 
		the week. We will look for somewhere else tomorrow. Back at the dive 
		centre we booked ourselves onto our first dive trip tomorrow which we do 
		as customers and met David who I think will be our instructor for most 
		of the course.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate at a restaurant at the beach and had a pretty good meal before 
		returning to our room to listen to World Service.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Neither of us are too sure of what to make of Gapang from our first 
		impression. The beach is smaller than we expected. We were not expecting 
		much development here but there is hardly anything here at all. The 
		restaurants seen very basic (although the food was very good tonight). 
		Our room is OK and has a very nice balcony but the downstairs outside 
		bathroom is certainly not ideal. We will certainly be looking for 
		somewhere else to stay for the remainder of our stay.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Sunday, 4th March 2007</font> </b>The first day of our 
		dive master training. Today was just doing fun dives as we need to start 
		learning the dive sites. Both dives were very enjoyable. The visibility 
		was a lot better than we have got used to in Thailand and the currents 
		were not too bad. We dived with Silke who has just finished her DM 
		training and on the second dive also with Daniel, an Indonesian DMT. On 
		the first dive we saw the biggest Napoleon wrasse we have ever seen and 
		on the second a turtle sheltering from the current.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In between dives, we went and had a look at a couple of rooms at a 
		nearby resort. We found a much better room than the one we are in at the 
		moment and should move in tomorrow. It has loads more space, an attached 
		bathroom and still has the views of the sea from the balcony. Hopefully 
		we will be there for the rest of our time here.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I was a lot happier with everything here today. We have found a nicer 
		place to stay, the food that we have eaten has all been OK and the 
		diving has been excellent. Roz still not really sure!</p>
