		Monday, 12th February 2007</font> </b>Did not get up much before 11. We 
		went straight into Phuket Town by bus and had roti chani for breakfast 
		when we got there. In Phuket Town, we sent home another box of 
		souvenirs, presents, and anything else that is not necessary to carry 
		around. We also sent back our Thailand Lonely Planet so will have to try 
		and survive without it for the next couple of weeks. We stocked up on 
		second hand books, got a couple of sandwiches for lunch and got a bus 
		back to Kata by about 3.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Did not do a lot for the rest of the day but did manage to get in touch 
		with a travel agent in Medan to start sorting out our flights from Medan 
		- Banda Aceh. Also booked ferry tickets to Phi Phi for two days time.</p>

		Went out on West Coast's day boat for the first time for a trip to King 
		Cruiser, Shark Point and Koh Doc Mai. A really good day out with three 
		good dives. Shark Point in particular was excellent with good vis and 
		ghost pipe fish all over the place! Dived with a Japanese DM, Hisako, 
		and two instructors (one of which had not dived in the last nine years)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at our new room in The Little Mermaid by 6ish. After looking at the 
		days photos, we checked e-mail and found that we can fly to Banda Aceh 
		on the day we arrive in Indonesia which is good news. Ate out at an 
		Indian restaurant for a change. Cost a bit more than usual but had very 
		good saag chicken and chicken tikka masala.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Another early start. We were picked up by minibus at about 7:30 and 
		driven to the pier for the 8:30 ferry to Phi Phi. We arrived in Phi Phi 
		at 10:30 and left our luggage at Phi Phi Scuba (recommended by Milton) 
		and went to look for somewhere to stay.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0710.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		knew a lot of places would be full due to it being peak season but we 
		eventually found a pretty good room for B1600. It did not have air-con 
		but had an excellent balcony with views overlooking both the main bays. 
		We checked in for the three nights that the room is available for.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked back to Phi Phi Scuba, collected our luggage and booked a days 
		diving to the local dive sites for tomorrow. We walked back to the 
		resort and carried everything up to our room - quite a way up the side 
		of the hill. We went back down to buy a few things we needed and bought 
		sandwiches to eat on the balcony for lunch. Most of the rest of the day 
		was spent either in the room or on the balcony which was in the sun for 
		the last few hours of the afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had our Valentine's Day meal in the same restaurant that we ate in 
		last time we were in Phi Phi but neither of us felt like too many beers 
		so it was a relatively early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0329.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		were up at 6:30 and just managed to get breakfast from our restaurant 
		before walking to Phi Phi Scuba. We met up with Katrin, our DM, and Jap 
		who was one of the instructors we dived with two days ago. Jap's son 
		Mark completed our group. It was a short boat ride out to the first 
		site, where we had not dived before. This was our 300th dive and was 
		pretty good - leopard sharks, mating nudibranchs, loads of fish and very 
		nice soft coral. The second dive was at Koh Bida Noi which was also very 
		good. We were back on Phi Phi just before two, did log books etc back at 
		the dive shop and were heading back to our resort by 2:30</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Roz had not been feeling that well between dives and by the time we 
		started walking back to the resort, she was feeling a lot worse. She did 
		not do a lot all afternoon apart from sleep. She was not up to eating a 
		lot by the evening but we went out for a very good pizza (which I ate 
		most of) and had an early night without the planned Sang Som.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Found out from Cathy that Kenny Jackett had left Swansea - not good news 
		in my opinion.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Fri</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 16th February 2007</font> </b>
		A day where we hardly did anything! We went for a walk on the beach 
		after breakfast but other than that, I did not leave the room until we 
		went out for tea in the evening. Roz had just about recovered from 
		whatever it was she was suffering from yesterday but was still not 100%. 
		She made it out at lunchtime to use the internet and bought lunch back 
		to the room. I spent the whole day reading, either in the room or on the 
		balcony. All very enjoyable!</p>

		Two more local dives with Phi Phi Scuba. The first was at Koh Bida Noi 
		again which was OK without being too spectacular. The second was at 
		Malong (so called because it is between Palong and Maya Bays). Roz had 
		asked if we could dive here as it is the best site in the area for 
		seeing turtles. We saw our first almost as soon as we were in the water 
		swimming away from us. We moved on to Turtle Corner and there were 
		turtles all over the place. We saw six in total during the first 20 
		minutes of the dive including two sat down together which I don't think 
		we have ever seen before. Turtley Terrific!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back at the room by about 3 and spent the rest of the afternoon 
		in the room or on the balcony. We phoned a couple of places in Lanta to 
		try and book a room for tomorrow but everywhere seems very full. We did 
		manage to get a fan room for one night but they are full the following 
		night so we will have to find somewhere else for the rest of our stay. 
		We also booked ourselves onto the Hin Muang trip for Monday with Lanta 
		Diver.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a couple of beers on the balcony before going out to eat. We 
		returned to Cosmic Restaurant where we had been a couple of nights ago. 
		This time we both had pizza together with a couple of half litre carafes 
		of the house white wine which made a pleasant change. We purchased a 
		&quot;Sang Som Bucket&quot; on the way back to the resort (one Sang Som, two diet 
		cokes, a bag of ice and a plastic bucket) and consumed it on the balcony 
		while listening to the football on World Service (Doncaster 2, Swansea 
		2)</p>

		Sunday, 18th February 2007</font> </b>We checked out of our room at 
		10:45 and walked to the pier, collecting our dive gear on the way. The 
		boat left at 11:30 and we were back in Lanta by 1pm, exactly two months 
		since we got here in December. We left our diving bag at Lanta Diver and 
		got a taxi to the Klong Dao Beach Resort where we checked into a nice 
		enough room for Baht 800. We immediately went out to try and find a room 
		to move to tomorrow. Loads of places are fully booked due to a 
		combination of Chinese New Year and Swedish school holidays. We 
		eventually took a room at Time for Lime which was not ideal but we were 
		fast running out of options.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to our resort for lunch and spent a lot of the rest of the 
		afternoon trying to work out what to do for the next week or so until we 
		get to Penang. We saw our first rain since Bangkok when a heavy storm 
		passed over us in the late afternoon. This coincided with a power cut. 
		We went out for tea when the rain stopped as it was too dark to do 
		anything in the room.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate at Sunset and while waiting for our food, we decided that after a 
		couple of nights at Time for Lime, we would move to a nicer room which 
		we had looked at on our way along the beach. It is an air-con room near 
		Sunset and although the balcony is not great, will be ideal for a couple 
		of days of not doing much before we leave Lanta on Saturday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in the room by 9 and had an early night.</p>
