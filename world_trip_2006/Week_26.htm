		Got up at about 9 for breakfast but did not leave the room again until 
		after midday. We were nowhere near as badly hung-over as we had been in 
		Bangkok but slept for most of the morning anyway. We spent the afternoon 
		on the beach apart from a trip out for lunch at 2ish. Ran for 20 minutes 
		before tea at our hotel restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 5th December 2006</font></b> 
		Another day of not doing a lot apart from reading on the beach and 
		trying to sort out hotels/flights for later in the trip. Booked another 
		days diving for tomorrow. Roz phoned both her mum and Cathy. I ran for 
		about 26 minutes.</p>

		Dived again with Wing Divers. When we go the boat, we discovered that 
		Ray, who we had dived with previously, was ill and there were apparently 
		no other dive masters available. This meant that we would be diving with 
		an instructor (Dave) and two students who were completing their open 
		water course. This did not seem ideal but it did not turn out too badly.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We spent about 30 minutes snorkelling at the first site while waiting 
		for the students to complete some of their skills. We all dived almost 
		as soon as they had finished and we were able to continue the dive with 
		Dave after the students were low on air - ending up with a 73 minute 
		dive. We did the second dive with them again and although they did one 
		or two skills during the dive, it did not affect us too much. Neither 
		dive was overly spectacular although both were still quite enjoyable 
		with enough to see. Both dives were very shallow, partly due to who we 
		were diving with and partly due to the visibility not being that good 
		anyway. Got back to the hotel at about 6:45.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 7th December 2006</font></b> 
		Did not do much all day again. Due to the high tides at the moment, 
		there was hardly any beach to lie on for most of the day so had to 
		sunbathe in the hotel garden in front of our balcony. Spent an hour or 
		two there in the morning, checked e-mail, had lunch, a couple more hours 
		in the sun, etc, etc. We still do not appear to be getting much closer 
		to either sorting out accommodation in Chiang Mai or getting anything 
		booked in Myanmar.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Ate out at the same restaurant on the beach that we ate at last night 
		and were back in the room by 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 8th December 2006</font></b> 
		We had to change rooms this morning as we wanted to stay one night 
		longer than we had planned to and our existing room was unavailable for 
		the extra night. We spent an hour or so lying in the garden (no beach 
		again) and moved at about 11. The new room was slightly better due to 
		having an 
		excellent balcony overlooking the beach (or the sea when we moved in!). 
		We sunbathed on the balcony for a while before heading off to use the 
		internet. We found that we had finally managed to book a room in Chiang 
		Mai for Monday night and things seem to be progressing with our Myanmar 
		booking.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We also tried to book Nok Air flights from Mae Hong Son back to Chiang 
		Mai for 9 days time as it is a cheap flight that will save us a days bus 
		travel. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2135.JPG" width="270" height="203" align="left">When we tried to book this on-line, we could not do it due to 
		not having a Thai credit card. We attempted to book over the phone and 
		Roz was told that we had 24 hours to make the payment at either a Nok Air 
		office, a bank or at a 7-11. The first 7-11 we tried did not know what 
		we were talking about but after lunch we tried the other one and it went 
		remarkably smoothly. We gave the cashier a reference number, paid about 
		Baht 1800 for our two tickets and got a till receipt with our names and 
		the flight details.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		&nbsp;We faxed all the required details to the travel 
		agent that is sorting out our Myanmar flights so hopefully that is 
		getting close to being sorted out. With lunch, this had taken about 
		three hours to sort out.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had about an hour on the beach after sorting everything out and it 
		was then time to watch the sun setting from our balcony while starting 
		on the beer again. It was a very similar session to the one five nights 
		ago with the same end result, i.e. we do not remember getting back to the 
		room!</p>

		Once again, our hangovers were not too bad but we still spent most of 
		the morning in our room. Did not really do much for the rest of the day. 
		We had lunch in the same place we have eaten in almost every day since 
		we have been here and had a couple of hours on the beach during the 
		afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		As it was our last night on Koh Chang, we both felt like having a few 
		beers. Roz suggested getting a few bottles for listening to the football 
		and I was keen on having a couple on the balcony while watching the sun 
		set (did not feel like running). We had two bottles of Leo for watching 
		the sunset, had two bottles of Chang with our meal and bought 4 more 
		bottles of Leo to consume while listening to World Service (Blackpool 1, 
		Swansea 1). I was just about asleep by final whistle at midnight.</p>

		Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		10th December 2006</font></b> 
		We checked out of the hotel at 8 and began what was to become a 29 hour 
		journey to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. Getting to Bangkok all went as 
		smoothly as we could of possibly hoped for. We got a songthaew from 
		outside our hotel to the ferry pier in time for the 9 o'clock ferry. On 
		the other side there was another songthaew waiting to take people to the 
		bus station so we were able to be on a bus heading for Bangkok by about 
		10:45. The journey to the Eastern Bus Station in Bangkok took slightly 
		longer than going the other way due to a lunch stop but we we were still 
		there by about 4:30. We got the sky train and then MRT to the train 
		station and left our rucksacks in left luggage as we still had 5 hours 
		to kill before our train.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2167.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">We 
		returned (via MRT and sky train again) to the MBK shopping centre to 
		kill time for a couple of hours. We bought ourselves a &quot;Happy SIM&quot; to 
		give us cheap phone calls and used it straight away to book another Nok 
		Air flight - from Bangkok to Krabi on 22nd January. We ate in the food 
		hall and then returned to the railway station stopping at another 7-11 
		to pay for the flights on the way.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had an hour or so to kill at the station but the train was in by 8:45 
		so we could get our luggage in place and hung around on the platform 
		until departure. We left just about on time at 10 and were in our beds 
		asleep about an hour later.</p>
