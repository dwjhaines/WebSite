		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0004.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Monday, 11th September 2006</font> </b>I was feeling a lot better than 
		yesterday with my cold almost totally cleared up. After we had checked 
		out of the room, we spent most of the rest of the day lying by the pool 
		apart from another trip to McDonalds for lunch. Just before 5, we left 
		the hotel, walked up to the main road and got a taxi out to the bus 
		station. Despite what I had been told yesterday, we were able to buy 
		tickets in advance and paid LE100 (about £9.30) each for the journey to Luxor. The bus 
		turned up before 6 and we departed at about 6:10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Lonely Planet reckoned that the journey took 12 - 15 hours but this did 
		not seem likely given the times that it stated for the individual legs 
		of the journey. The journey was not wonderful but probably not the worst 
		we have ever had. Up until midnight, the bus was too hot and we did not 
		have a lot of space. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0005.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">However, there was enough going on every couple of 
		hours to mean that I was never totally bored despite not being able to 
		sleep much. Roz managed to sleep quite well from midnight but I don't 
		think I slept at all until after the drinks stop at 3am. We were all 
		woken at 5 at Hurghada when a group of seven Western tourists got on and 
		got half the bus to change seats so that they could be seated together. 
		At 8 we finally managed to get a double seat each which meant that we 
		slept well for the last hour of the trip. The bus finally pulled into 
		the new bus station at 9:15 - just over 15 hours after it had left 
		Sharm.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Tuesday, 12th September 2006</font> </b>Once off the bus we got a 
		minibus into Luxor and had a twenty minute walk to the hotel we had 
		booked from our room in Sharm. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from 
		the hotels we had stayed at during our first visit to Luxor. Thankfully, we were given a room straight 
		away so were able to catch up on a couple of hours sleep. At 1, we went 
		out for lunch. We ate near the hotel but the kushari places that we were 
		looking for seemed to have closed or disappeared. After eating, we 
		walked to the train station and booked our 1st class tickets to Aswan 
		for Thursday (only about £3) We walked back to the hotel via the Nile. 
		The whole time we were out, we had to put up with people offering us 
		taxis, boat trips, souvenirs, etc, etc - all part of the fun of being in 
		Luxor.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0069.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">We 
		spent an hour or so by the pool (sleeping in my case) and then went out 
		to begin our sight-seeing. We got to the Luxor temple just before 
		sun-set. We had visited 11 years ago but were still impressed. We 
		wandered around the site in daylight and waited for the sun to set 
		before walking around again while it was illuminated. I had not been 
		that keen on doing this but it was worth the wait as it was more 
		spectacular seen this way (we did not bother waiting 11 years ago!) 
		After taking about 80 photos between us, we left the temple and went 
		straight out to eat. I think we would of both fallen asleep if we had 
		returned to the hotel for showers before going out.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in the hotel by 9:20 and had an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wedne</b></font><b><font size="4">sday, 13th September 2006</font> </b>
		After breakfast, we used the hotel's internet access to book our room in 
		Aswan for tomorrow night. We also contacted Dive Tours to see if they 
		could book us an additional night in Sharm for next Tuesday. (Also found 
		out that Swansea had won 2 - 0 at Brentford to move up to third place in 
		League 1)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_1476.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="right">We 
		continued our sight-seeing with a trip out to Karnak. We got out to 
		Karnak by minibus from the railway station. The ruins were once again, 
		very impressive, particularly the great hypostyle hall. We had just 
		managed to beat the tour groups to the site so had an hour or so 
		wandering round before it really started to fill up. By the time we had 
		finished looking around and had got a minibus back to Luxor again, it 
		was time for lunch and today we were able to find somewhere serving 
		kushari.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_7145.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="left">We 
		wandered back to the hotel stopping to take pictures of some of the more 
		interesting shops along the way. By 1 pm we had returned to the room for 
		a siesta.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We made it to the pool by about 4:30 and stayed by the pool (which is on 
		the roof of the hotel) until the sun had set. We had showers and 
		returned to the same restaurant that we had ate in last night despite 
		the fact that my meal yesterday had contained a piece of glass from a 
		light bulb!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Thursday, 14th September 2006</font> </b>We had 
		breakfast, checked out of the hotel and walked to the train station by 
		9:10. There was a lot of confusion at the station and we were told that 
		our train, due to leave at 9:25, was running three hours late. The 7:15 
		train had not departed yet either but we were told that we could not use 
		our tickets on that train and we could not buy new tickets either as the 
		train was full. At about 9:30, a train bound for Aswan came into the 
		station, We assumed that it was the 7:15 and although we had been told 
		that we could not get on it, we decided that we may as well get on 
		anyway - the worse thing that could happen is that we would be made to 
		pay again or get kicked off. It turned out that the train was not the 
		7:15 but another train that foreigners are not supposed to use. There 
		are only three trains a day that we are allowed to buy tickets for, all 
		of which have armed guards and are supposedly safer.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the train had left the station, we were told by the ticket 
		collector that we were on the wrong train. We pleaded ignorance and he 
		eventually just said &quot;no problem&quot; a couple of times and left us where we 
		were. We had been prepared to bribe him to let us stay but it was not 
		necessary. We eventually arrived in Aswan just before 1pm.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had decided that we would leave Aswan by overnight train on Sunday as 
		neither of us were keen on another 15 hour bus journey back to Sharm. We 
		reserved seats at the station as soon as we arrived, visited the tourist 
		information and then had a 10 - 15 minute walk to our hotel. More 
		confusion at the hotel as they have not yet received their voucher 
		despite the fact that we have paid for a room but we eventually got 
		given a room with an excellent view of the Nile.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0152.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="right">We 
		went out for lunch (kushari again) wandering through the souk in both 
		directions. There is not quite as much hassle here as in Luxor but still 
		plenty of people trying to sell you things. We spent a couple of hours 
		by the pool and then returned to the room from where we watched the sun 
		setting over the Nile again - this time with plenty of feluccas.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked back to the station area for our evening meal. On the way, we 
		found out details of tours to Abu Simbel and used the internet to book a 
		room in the Cairo Hilton for Monday night. We ate excellent &quot;Egyptian 
		pizzas&quot;, walked back to the hotel and booked our tour to Abu Simbel for 
		Saturday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Fri</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 15th September 2006</font> </b>
		We were up early to begin our sight-seeing and, after breakfast, headed 
		for the West Bank. We got the ferry across the Nile for LE1 each despite 
		being told that &quot;the ferry does not start until 9 o'clock&quot;, &quot;the ferry 
		is for locals only&quot;, &quot;you must use felucca&quot;, etc, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Once on the West Bank, we walked up to the Tombs of the Nobles. We had a 
		personal guide which we did not really want but he turned out to be 
		pretty good showing us round everything we wanted to see. The tombs were 
		all quite interesting, maybe not as spectacular as the Valley of the 
		Kings, but we were the only tourists there which made it more enjoyable. 
		After an hour wandering around there, the next sight we wanted to visit 
		was the Monastery of St Simeon. We were prepared to get there by a 
		couple of ferry trips but I was also quite keen on a camel ride as I had 
		never been on one before.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0197.JPG" width="265" height="199" align="left">We 
		managed to negotiate a couple of camels for LE20 each and had a 
		reasonably enjoyable 40 minute ride round to the monastery.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The monastery itself was pretty good. Once again, we were the only 
		tourists there - I'm not sure where everyone is going during the day! We 
		were shown around by a member of the tourist police which was not 
		necessary this time as we could easily of wandered around on our own. 
		From the monastery, we had planned to walk down to another ferry point 
		to get the ferry to Elaphantine Island. After we had walked down to 
		where we thought the ferry should go from, there was no ferry in sight 
		and it looked this time as if everyone was correct when they said that 
		there was no ferry. Instead of paying for a felucca or another camel, we 
		walked back through the sand to our original ferry point. This was quite 
		hard work and was not a route travelled by too many tourists but it did 
		keep us away from the touts for 40 minutes or so. We got the ferry back 
		without any arguments and went straight for lunch at the same kushari 
		place as yesterday.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/IMG_1534.JPG" width="200" height="267" align="right">We 
		were back in the room by 1:00 and were planning on a couple of hours 
		sleep before going to the pool. I was woken at 2 by reception who have 
		still not got our payment voucher and want us to pay for the room 
		despite us already paying lastminute.com. I then spent about an hour and 
		twenty minutes going round internet cafes trying to get a printout of 
		the e-mail confirming that we had paid. They were still not convinced 
		when I showed them the voucher but did find the name of another agency 
		that they could call. Ten minutes after giving them the voucher they had 
		sorted it out but it wasted a lot of the afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a&nbsp; couple of hours by the pool, early showers and another 
		pizza before heading off to see the Sound and Light show at the Isis 
		temple complex on the island of Philae. We paid a taxi LE30 to take us 
		there and back and another LE40 for the boat to get us to and from the 
		island. The Sound and Light show was pretty good although it did drag on 
		at times. The temples were very spectacular and would be worth seeing in 
		day light if they were not so much hassle to get to. Got the taxi back 
		to our hotel and were in our room before 10.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 16th September 2006</font> </b>
		We got up at 3 am for our day trip to Abu Simbel. We were picked up from 
		our hotel at 3:30 and after collecting from a few more hotels, headed 
		off to join up with&nbsp; the &quot;convoy&quot;. The convoy is the only way that 
		tourist coaches can travel to Abu Simbel. It involves all the buses and 
		minibuses congregating in the South of Aswan and then travelling 
		together under armed police escort. This is apparently for our own 
		safety but seems a totally ridiculous idea. It also means that just 
		about everyone who wants to visit Abu Simbel arrives at the temples at 
		exactly the same time.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Egypt_0247.JPG" width="266" height="195" align="left">We 
		all got to the meeting point at 4:15 and left 15 minutes later. There 
		were about 15 - 20 coaches in the convoy as well as an assortment of 
		smaller buses and minibuses. The 260km journey took less than three 
		hours and we were dropped off at 7:15. We then had 2.5 hours at the 
		temples before the return convoy.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The two temples were both very spectacular particularly the main one. 
		However, once we had taken a few photos of them both, there was not too 
		much else to do and the amount of time there was ample. The insides of 
		the temples were full of tourists and not much more interesting than the 
		tombs we saw yesterday. We spent most of our time there sat outside 
		looking at the statues at the front of the temples. However, we both 
		thought that the temples were worth seeing and were glad we had gone.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The convoy left again on time at 10 and we were dropped back in Aswan 
		just before 1. We had lunch and then returned for three hours sleep 
		before listening to the football on World Service (Gillingham 3, Swansea 
		1) in our room while 
		watching the sun set again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Before eating we had a walk through the less touristy part of the souk, 
		heading Southwards from our hotel. This was much better than the other 
		part that we had previously walked through with a lot less people trying 
		to sell us things. We ate in a restaurant overlooking 
		the river and were back in the room by 9:15. Both totally knackered 
		following our early start despite catching up on sleep this afternoon.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We were up at 7:15 for our last sight-seeing trip in Aswan. We had 
		breakfast and then got a taxi out to the &quot;unfinished obelisk&quot;. This was 
		a 45m obelisk that had been abandoned when a flaw was discovered in the 
		rock from which it was being cut. It was quite an impressive sight - 
		probably better that I was expecting it to be. We stayed at the quarry 
		for 20 minutes or so before walking back to the hotel. We walked back 
		through the Fatimid Cemetery which was not quite as interesting.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We stayed in our room until check-out time and spent the rest of the 
		afternoon lying by the pool. We did not go out for lunch as Roz had an 
		upset stomach and did not want to risk eating anything other than 
		biscuits before our train journey.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		&nbsp;We had tickets for the 6pm train to Cairo. We left the pool at 5, 
		got a taxi to the station and got a take-away pizza for the journey 
		(Roz's stomach getting better!). The train left about 15 minutes late. 
		The first class seats were infinitely more comfortable than the bus 
		seats had been on our previous overnight journey and we were both able 
		to get a reasonable nights sleep.</p>
