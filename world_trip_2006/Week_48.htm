		until 3pm when we went diving again. Roz was keen on a night dive at the 
		Liberty so and we chose to do a late afternoon dive at nearby Paradise 
		reef. Probably not the two most spectacular dives of the trip but there 
		was enough to see to make the dive interesting. Bump-head parrot fish 
		featured on both dives. We saw a couple on the first dive as well as a 
		black-tip reef shark and a few ribbon eels. On the second we had an 
		excellent close-up view of one on the wreck as well as seeing at lest 
		three others. Back at Amed by about 8:30. We stopped to eat at Diver's 
		Cafe and were back in the room by 9:30.</p>

		Two more local dives on our own. We did them both from a fishing boat, 
		the second starting and ending just in front of our bungalow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a few beers in the evening, before and during our meal at Warung 
		Mekar and then finished our duty free on the balcony while talking to 
		the couple from the only other bungalow here.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Our final days diving with Eco Divers. We returned to Tulamben and 
		repeated the dives at the Liberty and the Tulamben Wall. Both very 
		enjoyable again. Eco Divers have been an excellent dive centre - very 
		efficient and very friendly staff. Another evening with a few drinks. We 
		had a couple on our balcony and were joined by Martin and Caroline from the other 
		bungalow again. We ate with them in a warung across the road and then 
		Roz and I returned to our balcony for more beer and a bottle of Balinese 
		wine.</p>

		Did not do a lot all day again. Not too hung-over but quite tired from a 
		combination of the diving and last nights alcohol. Spent quite a bit of 
		time in the afternoon and evening looking back at the photos from the 
		earlier parts of the trip. We ate at the warung over the road again and 
		had a few beers but had a relatively early night</p>

		Spent a final few hours on our balcony before leaving Amed just before 
		11. We had arranged for a car and driver to take us to Sanur and Nyoman 
		from Juking Bungalows came along as well. It was an enjoyable journey 
		with plenty of photo stops as we drove through the scenic rice fields. 
		We arrived in Sanur at 1ish and took a room in the second hotel that we 
		looked at.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out almost immediately and walked to &quot;DiveMasters&quot;, the dive 
		shop that had been recommended to us by Eco Divers. We looked at the 
		BCD's and regulators that they had and got all the prices before going 
		away to think about it. We looked at reviews and UK prices on the 
		internet and it definitely does not make sense for us to buy the gear at 
		home. It is a lot cheaper here and it will save us the cost of equipment 
		hire in Sulawesi. Due to the amount of diving we did with Eco Divers we 
		are able to get the trade discount on everything we buy which turns out 
		to be quite a large saving. We just about decided that we would go for 
		it here and now just need to decide exactly what BCD to buy - the main 
		decision being whether or not to buy a BCD with integrated weight 
		pockets.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the room for showers and a beer before going out to eat. 
		After eating, we were planning on an early night but bumped into Torsten 
		and Silke while shopping in Circle K. They are working in the Gili 
		Islands and are in Sanur for a few days en-route to KL. We went to a 
		restaurant with them and spent the rest of the night there with a few 
		more beers while discussing our experiences at Lumba Lumba. Got back to 
		the room round about midnight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Saturday, 12th May 2007</font> </b>We headed back to 
		DiveMasters just after it opened at 10:30. After talking to Torsten and 
		Silke last night we had both decided against integrated weights and made 
		up our minds about what we wanted to buy.&nbsp; We both changed our 
		minds about the exact BCD's we wanted while still in the shop, but ended 
		up with complete sets and a bag to carry everything in for US$1229.&nbsp; 
		We reckon that we will save at least half of that in equipment hire 
		charges in the next few weeks so are fairly convinced that it was a good 
		thing to do.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Buying everything took almost two hours including the walk to the ATM 
		and the ten transactions it took to extract the Rp11,000,000 that was 
		required. We walked back to the hotel with our purchases and spent an 
		hour or so by the pool before going out shopping again at 4. We booked 
		ourselves on a dive trip for tomorrow so we can test our new equipment. 
		We had an unsuccessful trip to a chemist and a more productive visit to 
		a supermarket with another 45 minutes on the internet in between. By the 
		time we were back in the room, we had just enough time for showers 
		before going out to meet Torsten and Silke again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We met in the same place that we had all been in yesterday and had a 
		meal before they headed off to meet friends in Kuta. We had another 
		couple of drinks on our balcony but a relatively early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We were picked up by Blue Season Bali at 7:30 and were on the boat for 
		Nusa Penida by just after 8. We did three dives - Manta Point, Crystal 
		Bay and SD - all of which were very different to each other.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Manta Point was not the best of dives. We spent about 40 minutes hanging 
		around in poor visibility hoping for a manta sighting but there were 
		none around. Crystal Bay was a lot better with clear water, loads of 
		fish, really nice soft coral and even a turtle! The third dive at SD was 
		a drift dive in a current comparable to some of the strongest we ever 
		had at Pulau Weh. For most of the dive we were speeding past the reef 
		which was all pretty nice again. Saw loads of batfish and some of the 
		biggest travellies we have ever seen. It was a good days diving and all 
		our new equipment had worked without any problems. We were back at our 
		room by about 4:30</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We started drinking again at 7ish. We had a few drinks before going out 
		and another couple of beers with tea. At 10, we found a bar showing the 
		two games that would decide who got relegated from the Premiership. We 
		stayed in there until the games finished and returned to the room where 
		we finished the night off with a few glasses of Bacardi.</p>
