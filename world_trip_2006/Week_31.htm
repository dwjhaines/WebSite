		Had a later start than yesterday and did not get up until about 9. After 
		breakfast, we cycled to the Diethelm Travel office and booked our ferry 
		tickets to Bagan on Thursday. We also booked the Traders Hotel in Yangon 
		for our last two nights in Myanmar. We returned to the hotel and went to 
		the pool until 1ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0538.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		went out on our bikes again at about 1:30. Outside our hotel, we found a 
		taxi driver and arranged a trip round a couple of the ancient cities in 
		the area for tomorrow. We then went to book tickets 
		for a traditional marionette puppet show tonight. We bought bananas for 
		lunch as neither of us is that impressed with the food here so decided 
		we may as well go for a cheaper healthier option. We ate the 
		bananas sat by the moat of the royal palace and fort, the first place we 
		were to visit on our afternoons sight-seeing.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The royal palace was OK but nowhere near as spectacular as what we saw 
		yesterday. We went from there to the two sights at the foot of Mandalay 
		Hill that we had missed yesterday. Shwenandaw Kyaung is a traditional 
		Burmese wooden monastery which was good as it was a bit different to some of the 
		pagodas we have visited. It was also very touristy with young monks asking for money for 
		photographs. Kyauktawgyi Paya complete with 8m, 900 tonne Buddha was 
		also worth visiting and 
		completed our tour of this part of Mandalay. We cycled back to the 
		centre of Mandalay, returned our bikes to Mr Htoo and were back in the 
		hotel by 5:15.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went for an early tea (at the chapatti stand again) and walked to the 
		Mandalay Marionette Theatre for the 8:30 performance. It was a bit of a 
		strange show, ranging from totally crap in parts to mildly amusing in 
		others. Overall it was just about entertaining but we would not of 
		wanted it to have gone on for more than an hour!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We were picked up from our hotel at 7:15 for our tour of two of the 
		ancient cities near to Mandalay. We had chosen the budget taxi option 
		which meant that the taxi was a sort of miniature songthaew and looked 
		not much bigger than a toy car. It was however comfortable enough for 
		the two of us particularly as the cities were only about 30km away.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We arrived at Sagaing about an hour after leaving the hotel and were 
		dropped at the base of Sagaing Hill. It took about 30 minutes to walk to 
		the top passing stupas, monasteries and nunneries along the way. The 
		views from the top were excellent with plenty of temples dotted around 
		the surrounding countryside. It was quite misty as we climbed but 
		getting there early meant that there were no other tourists around. We 
		spent about 30 minutes looking around the pagoda at the top before 
		walking down and went to Tilawkaguru, a mural filled cave temple near 
		the base of the hill. It took a few minutes for our driver to find a 
		monk with a key to let us into the cave but we were then given candles 
		to wander around the inside with.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0622.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		drove from Sagaing to Inwa stopping at Hsinmyashin Paya (or Pagoda of 
		Many Elephants) for about 10 minutes on the way. Inwa is on an island 
		formed by rivers and a canal so we needed a short ferry ride to get to 
		the start of our tour there. Once on the island, we hired a horse and 
		cart for a couple of hours as this is the only way of getting around. We 
		visited the three main sites here, two monasteries and a 27m high 
		watchtower. Both monasteries were pretty good. The first was made 
		entirely from teak and was still in use as a school. The second was 
		probably more spectacular from the outside - made from stone and with a 
		paya next to it. The walk up the tower gave good views of the whole 
		area and of Sagaing Hill where we had been previously. The two hour trip round Inwa cost K3000, again excellent value. We 
		got the boat back across to the mainland and were returned to our hotel 
		in Mandalay by 1:45. It had been another very enjoyable days 
		sight-seeing. We paid $15 for the taxi for the day and arranged for the 
		same driver to come and pick us up to take us to the ferry pier in two 
		days time.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back at the hotel, we had more bananas for lunch and went to the pool 
		until 3:30 when it becomes almost totally shaded. We did not do a lot 
		for the rest of the day until going out to the chapatti stand for tea at 
		7ish. We ate with the same American bloke we met two nights ago as well 
		as an Indian who is staying in the same hotel as him. Were back in the 
		room just before 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 10th January 2007</font> </b>
		Had a quiet day of not doing much today. We have seen a lot in the last 
		few days. There are only so many temples that we can visit before we get 
		fed up of them and thought it was a good idea to try and avoid this 
		before getting to Bagan! We had a late breakfast and spent the rest of 
		the morning by the pool. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0302.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We had decided that we would hire bikes for a 
		few hours in the afternoon and visit the one sight that we were 
		interested in that we had not visited yet. However, when we got to Mr Htoo's the place was all locked up. We were not overly disappointed and 
		went for lunch instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The walking tour in the book did not sound wonderful but we spent an 
		hour or so wondering round the street markets near our hotel which were 
		all quite interesting. We 
		returned to the hotel by 5 and with nothing else that we really wanted 
		to do, watched Happy Feet on the laptop.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We returned to the chapatti stand for the fifth and final time for tea. 
		It has been an excellent place to eat. Not only has the food been good 
		and very cheap, but watching the chapattis being made and cooked every 
		evening has been entertaining as well. Definitely one of my favourite 
		eating places of the trip so far!</p>

		Another early start as we had to catch the 7am ferry to Bagan. We were 
		up at 5:30 for breakfast and were picked up by our taxi driver from two 
		days ago at 6. We were on the boat by about 6:20 and chose a couple of 
		seats out on the deck at the back of the boat for the 10<font face="Times New Roman">½ 
		hour journey down the Ayeyarwady River.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">The journey was quite enjoyable and the 
		time went pretty quickly although we had probably both had enough by the 
		time we arrived in Bagan at exactly 5:30. Arriving in Bagan was quite 
		spectacular due to the number of temples visible from the river. Once 
		off the boat, we paid our $10 entrance fee for the Bagan area and got a 
		taxi to a guesthouse recommended in our book. We paid for two nights 
		accommodation using Kyat as the pile of money that we changed in Yangon 
		does not seem to be going down too quickly.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Times New Roman">We had done the boat journey on a couple of 
		bananas and a small packet of biscuits so went out early for a pizza. 
		The bill seemed very expensive after five nights at the chapatti stand 
		but was still just over £4 for two pizzas and our first Myanmar Beer 
		since getting here. The food was very good again.</font></p>

		We were up at 6:45 for our first day of touring Bagan's temples. We had 
		breakfast at 7 and then departed on bikes that we had hired from the 
		guest house. We spent a total of about 6 - 7 hours cycling round the 
		temples, mainly the ones in the Old Bagan area and on the North Plain. 
		There are literally thousands of temples in the area. Roz had 
		highlighted the ones that we wanted to visit and we managed to find most 
		of these as well as a few more. A lot of the temples were very 
		spectacular but the views of the whole area from some places were 
		equally impressive. We ticked off 12 from the book and also found others 
		that were not mentioned that were just as good.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in Nyaung U, the area we are staying in for lunch and back 
		in the room by about 2:30. I had not been feeling 100% all day and by 
		this time I was totally worn out and just wanted to sleep. I stayed in 
		bed until about 4:30 while Roz read on our balcony.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0357.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		went out again to see the sunset at the Shwezigon Paya in Nyaung U. This 
		was not the ideal place to see the sunset but was one of the best 
		pagodas we have seen here. We spent an hour or so there as it got dark 
		and the place became lit up.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out at Aroma 2, one of Lonely Planets top 5 restaurants in 
		Myanmar. The place served excellent Indian food on banana leaves and it probably was the 
		best meal we have had since getting to Myanmar.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 13th January 2007</font> </b>
		We had decided to spend three days and four nights in Bagan - one day 
		longer than planned. this meant that we could do a half day trip to Mt 
		Popa. The staff at our hotel had found another couple who wanted to do 
		this trip today so we joined them in a share-taxi and headed off at 8 
		o'clock (I had fully recovered from whatever I was suffering from 
		yesterday by this morning). It was an hours drive to the base of the 
		mountain and then a half hour walk up steps to the temples and 
		monasteries at the top. The views from the top were pretty good but it 
		was probably not the highlight of our visit to Bagan. We were back in 
		Bagan by midday giving us the afternoon to continue visiting temples.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0804.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We 
		left our hotel again at about 2:30 and continued working our way through 
		the temples. We got away from the main roads and visited some of the 
		harder to reach places ending up at Pyathada Paya to watch the sun set. 
		This was a much better spot than yesterday as we could climb onto a 
		terrace that gave excellent views of the area with the sun setting 
		behind the silhouettes of several other temples. The temple was 
		relatively crowded compared to yesterdays but it was still easy enough 
		to find a spot away from the crowds. As soon as the sun went down, we 
		started heading back as we needed to get back to the main road before 
		complete darkness. The views of the sky changing colour behind the 
		temples as we cycled back were also excellent.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out at Aroma 2 again and also had a couple of bottles of beer 
		with our meal. We bought a couple more beers to take back to the room 
		and drank them while watching Man United v Villa and listening to World 
		Service (Bradford 2, Swansea 2)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 14th January 2007</font> </b>
		We were still enthusiastic about seeing more temples despite the amount 
		we have seen in the last few days.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0455.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		left the hotel before 8 and cycled to a few that we had missed in the 
		Old Bagan/North Plain area. By 10, Roz was finding it hard work cycling 
		on some of the sandy paths but as most of the others that we wanted to 
		see were closer to the roads, this did not seem too big a problem. We 
		stopped at a few smaller temples and then cycled through New Bagan and 
		out to Dhammayazika Paya. This was the last of the main temples that we 
		had wanted to visit and was definitely one of the best. Not only was the 
		temple itself excellent, but it was possible to climb up to a terrace 
		for the best views that we have had since getting here. With the sun 
		behind us, it was possible to view the whole Bagan area and see nearly 
		all the temples we had been to in the last few days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		By the time we left here, Roz was feeling ill and we had to stop after 
		about 20 minutes as she was feeling faint. When she eventually got back 
		on her bike, it was a very slow journey back to our hotel, not helped by 
		a problem with her bike that we were not aware of at the time. Back at 
		the hotel, she went straight to sleep. After I had eaten, it was my turn 
		to read on the balcony while she appeared to be suffering from whatever 
		I had two days ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0459.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Roz 
		had recovered sufficiently by 5'clock to cycle out to another temple for 
		sunset. We went out to Shwesandaw Paya, one that we had visited two days 
		ago. It is one of the most famous sunset temples in the area and was 
		therefore crowded with loads of buses and taxis filling the car park. We 
		managed to find a decent space to sit and once again had superb views of 
		the setting sun. We were about the last people on the temple as everyone 
		else seemed to disappear as soon the the sun went and we cycled back to 
		Nyaung U in darkness again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate out at Aroma 2 for the third night in a row and were back in the 
		room by about 9.</p>
