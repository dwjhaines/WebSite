		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Monday, 23rd April 2007</font> </b>Up at 6:15 for 
		breakfast before walking with our luggage to the Komtar bus station. Our 
		bus was supposed to leave there at 7:30 but it did not leave until 8 
		meaning that we were 30 minutes late leaving the main Penang bus station 
		at 8:30. The journey was not too bad and we were dropped in the centre 
		of KL at about 1:15. We were about 1km away from the BB Plaza, a 
		shopping centre that we hoped may have somewhere selling camera 
		housings. Roz waited in a restaurant near where the bus station while I 
		walked to have a look.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		I visited about 8 - 10 shops. None of them had the exact housing I 
		wanted but I was able to get an Ixus800 and housing for roughly the 
		price we wanted to pay. I had decided that I wanted a camera for the 
		trip to Sipidan so purchased the camera and walked back to where Roz was 
		waiting. We got a taxi out to the Sentral Bus Terminal from where we got 
		the airport bus to the &quot;Low Cost Carrier Terminal&quot; at KLIA. This took just over 
		an hour and at about 4:45 we checked in for the Air Asia flight to Tawau. 
		We had a late lunch at McDonalds and went to wait for the 5:50 flight.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At about the expected departure time they announced that our flight was 
		going to be delayed. It turned out that an incoming flight was unable to 
		land at KL due to the bad weather (it had been raining very heavily) and 
		had been diverted to Penang. We had to wait for this plane to fly back 
		from Penang before we could depart. We eventually took off just after 
		8:30 - almost three hours late - meaning that we did not land in Tawau 
		until about 11:20. We collected our luggage fairly quickly and were 
		relieved to see that a driver from Borneo Divers was still at the 
		airport to meet us. We were driven to the centre of Tawau where we checked 
		into the hotel that we had booked by phone. Checked in a few minutes 
		before midnight.</p>

		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 24th April 2007</font> </b>
		Checked out of the hotel just before 7:00, almost exactly seven hours 
		after checking in. We were picked up by Borneo Divers again and driven 
		back to the airport where we picked up three Japanese divers, also 
		heading to Mabul. We then had another hours drive to get to Semporna where 
		we were dropped at the Borneo Divers office.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was a 45 minute boat trip to the resort where we arrived at about 
		10:30. We were dropped on the beach in front of the resort and were 
		taken up to the main reception area. We filled in all the paperwork and 
		were given a briefing on dive times, meal times, dos and don'ts, etc, 
		etc before being shown to our room. Another very nice place to stay and 
		close enough to the main building to be able to use the free wi-fi!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had lunch at midday and went for our first dive at 1. We were diving 
		with the three Japanese that we travelled here with and Jojo our DM. The 
		first dive was supposed to be a check dive although not too much 
		actually got checked. It was an easy site, five minutes away from the 
		resort by boat, with good vis and no currents and lots of nudibranchs.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_2918.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">The 
		second dive was at 3:20 and was even closer. The dive site - Paradise II 
		- is the one that we are allowed to go off and dive on our own each 
		evening now that we have been checked! It was an incredible dive. We saw 
		three different types of frogfish including a couple of giant frogfish 
		and once again, loads of nudibranchs. Roz managed to get photos of 12 
		different varieties today! Also saw the first turtle of our stay here.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Both dives were very enjoyable. I enjoyed the diving at Pulau Weh but it 
		was nice to be able to dive with no current, good vis and not have to 
		worry about guiding, mapping or anything else again. The dives are a bit 
		short here - 45 minutes seems to be normal - but apart from that it 
		looks as if it is going to be a good few days diving.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 25th April 2007</font> </b>
		First dive of the day at 8:30 and our group from yesterday was joined&nbsp; 
		by John and Leslie from Australia. The dive was all a bit messy to start 
		with. John and Lesley had problems with their weights and one of the 
		Japanese broke his mask strap. We were told to go down to 5m and wait 
		but only two of the Japanese ever appeared together with Jojo. After a 
		few minutes one of the Japanese had problems with his BCD and 
		disappeared with Jojo leaving three of us to continue the dive on our 
		own. Another very good dive and it did mean that we could go at our own 
		pace and stop to look at things.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The 
		second dive, our first at Sipidan, was one of the best we have ever 
		done. We had been told that we were not guaranteed to see turtles but 
		saw three as soon as we were in the water. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_3002.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Roz counted 13 or 14 in total 
		as well as 3 or 4 white tip reef sharks. We had the classic shot of a 
		turtle being followed by a bat fish which all made for some excellent 
		photos. Both the sharks and the turtles came very close to us and the 
		vis was the best we have seen here so far.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The third, also at Sipidan was not as good. We still saw turtles and 
		sharks and it was another excellent dive but could not match the 
		previous one. We returned to the resort where we did our fourth dive of 
		the day with an American called Walter. A similar dive to the one here last night with lots 
		of nudibranchs, pipe fish and a sea moth. All in all an excellent days 
		diving!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After our evening meal, I sent an e-mail to my previous manager at 
		Ericsson asking about the possibility of getting my old job back in 
		July. Within an hour or so, had a reasonably encouraging reply that 
		could be very good news.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We sat on our balcony and had a couple of Bacardi's before going to bed.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Up at 7 to open my birthday presents - new camera and underwater housing 
		as well as a bottle of wine for celebrating tonight. We departed for 
		Sipidan at 9 for another two dives there. Both dives were excellent 
		again. Roz counted 32 turtles on the two dives. We lost count of the 
		number of sharks that we saw and both dives in general were very 
		spectacular. We are already starting to think about Sipidan as a 
		destination for a two week holiday in the near future. It was also very 
		good to be diving with a camera again!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Did two more dives in the afternoon including our daily sunset dive at 
		Paradise II. The diving at Mabul is not as spectacular as at Sipidan but 
		there is still a lot to see and they were once again very good dives.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the last dive we started celebrating my birthday as well as our 
		10th wedding anniversary. We finished off our duty free Bacardi before 
		going to the poolside for a bar-b-q meal with &quot;entertainment&quot;. We had a 
		few beers with the meal and then returned to the balcony to drink the 
		bottle of wine. We had another beer before all the bar closed and were 
		quite pissed by the time we went to bed. A very turtley terrific 
		birthday!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0256.JPG" width="204" height="272" align="left">Friday, 27th April 2007</font> </b>Another very good 
		days diving despite feeling slightly rough when we woke up. We only did 
		one dive in the morning, a local dive at Mabul. We did two more dives at 
		Sipidan in the afternoon. Both were excellent again although Roz was not 
		happy about only seeing one turtle on the first of the two dives. Twelve 
		on the second dive seemed to make up for this however! We had another 
		good sunset dive at Paradise II to complete the day. Had an early night 
		due to having arranged to go to Sipidan at 5:30 tomorrow morning.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 28th April 2007</font> </b>
		Up at 5 for a 5:30 departure. We were at Sipidan and in the water by 6. 
		The dive was very nice again. Plenty of sharks and barracuda, five 
		turtles and plenty of other fish. We also saw a couple of bump head 
		parrot fish. They are one of the main reasons for getting here early 
		although they were not too spectacular. We had our one hour surface 
		interval on the island before the second dive. The second dive was as 
		good as any we have done here. Plenty more sharks and Roz counted 22 
		turtles bringing the total to 100 so far. The end of the dive in the 
		shallow part of the reef was excellent with turtles everywhere.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a few hours to kill back on Mabul before the third dive. We have 
		been looking into options for our month in Indonesia. We had made a few 
		enquiries into live-aboards in the Kimodo area but have not been able to 
		get anything booked. We have now knocked this idea on the head and are 
		instead planning on spending 10 days or so at Bunaken off Sulawesi. We 
		sent a few e-mails to a couple of the dive operators there and 
		eventually decided on a package with &quot;Two Fishes&quot;. We will spend a 
		couple of weeks in Bali before flying out there for about 10 days from 
		16th May.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The third dive at 1pm was 
		round the base of oil rig just off the beach from our resort. This, and 
		the sunset dive were both very good again.
		By the time we did the forth dive we were both starting to feel a bit 
		rough. We both had sore throats and were starting to get colds. The 
		weather here has not been wonderful and it has been quite cold after 
		diving. This and the fact that we have been doing four dives a day seems 
		to have finally taken its toll on our health. I was feeling worse in the 
		evening but we stayed up initially to watch the Everton v Man Utd. game 
		and then to listen to world service (Carlisle 1, Swansea 2).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia_2/IMG_0365.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 29th April 2007</font> </b>
		Had another relatively early start as we were doing a dive at 7:45 
		before our departure later this morning. It was another good dive - frog 
		fish, leaf scorpion fish, nudibranchs and a final turtle - although I 
		don't think either of us felt like getting out of bed so early. The 
		diving here really has been better than anything we have experienced 
		before. The Sipidan dives have been unbelievable and the muck diving 
		around Mabul has been far more enjoyable than I would have expected.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After the dive we packed up our stuff and checked out of our room by 
		10:00. We had an hour or so sitting around waiting for the boat back to 
		Semporna which left at about 11:30. We got the free transfer back to 
		Tawau where we checked into a nice hotel for the night. We had a quick 
		walk around the town to get Roz more medication for her skin infection 
		which seems to have returned and then spent the rest of the afternoon in 
		the room trying to recover from the last few days. I was still suffering 
		from my cold/sore throat and we were both totally worn out from not 
		getting enough sleep the last couple of days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out for Indian food in the evening but were back in the room by 
		8:30. Spent an hour or so waiting for texts to confirm that Sunderland 
		had been promoted to the Premiership while editing some of the 500 or so 
		photos we had taken between us in Sipidan. When the confirmation came 
		from both Mark and Cathy, there was not too much celebrating. We were 
		probably both asleep within 15 minutes of the final whistle!</p>
