		We did not get up until about 11:30. We packed and took our things to 
		Regan and Annette's room as they had booked a late check-out and we had 
		to check out at 12. We went to the MBK food centre for lunch, returned 
		to the hotel to collect our bags and got a taxi to the airport at about 
		2:30. Our second Nok Air flight was on time and we arrived in Krabi at 
		5:45.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Taxis from the airport into Krabi seemed overpriced so we walked out of 
		the airport to try and get a bus or cheaper taxi from the main road. 
		This was not looking a good idea and we were about to walk back into the 
		airport when an immigration officer stopped and gave us a lift. He was 
		going to drop us at the bus station but due to the lack of activity 
		there, he went out of his way to take us into the centre of town. We 
		checked into a cheap hotel and got a room for the night for B400.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		One of the reasons we had ended up in Krabi was that it is the 17th 
		anniversary of us going out together for the first time in Sydney. We 
		have tried to go for a pizza on the 22nd January ever since and Krabi 
		had what sounded like a good pizza restaurant. Before eating, we had a 
		walk around Krabi swapping books, booking a minibus for tomorrow and 
		stopping for a beer. The restaurant was very good with good starters and 
		excellent pizzas. We had a bottle of Sang Som with the meal and, despite 
		us both being tired, it was a very enjoyable evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 23rd January 2007</font> </b>
		We had booked a minibus for 10am and it turned up a few minutes before 
		this time. We were both half expecting to spend an hour or so driving 
		around Krabi before actually leaving but we had a couple of stops at 
		travel agents to pick people up and departed from the bus station by 
		10:15. The minibus was full but not too uncomfortable. The journey took 
		just over two hours including the two ferries and we were in Saladan by 
		about 12:30. We got a taxi to Kaw Kwang and checked in to room 205, 
		three along from where we had been at Christmas. We had lunch at the 
		restaurant and spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool. I went for a 
		run just after 4 which was hard work after the amount of alcohol 
		consumed after the last few days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_1063.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">We 
		walked into Saladan at 6ish. We went to Lanta Diver to book ourselves 
		onto two trips for Thursday and Friday. Then spent 40 minutes on the 
		internet before eating at Lanta Seafood and walking back to Kaw Kwang.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		During the evening we just about worked out what we will do for the next 
		4 - 5 weeks. We have paid for an extra three nights at Kaw Kwang meaning 
		we will stay here a total of nine nights until Feb 1st. We will then 
		move to Khao Lak for five nights before getting on the live-aboard to 
		the Similans. When we get back from the Similans, we will get dropped 
		back in Kata, probably staying at The Little Mermaid as it is a lot 
		cheaper than Pop Cottages. After three nights there, we will probably 
		return to Lanta or maybe Khao Lak if we prefer it there. We have the 
		option of trying Koh Lipe for a few days and will head for Indonesia via 
		Malaysia in the first week of March. We are now 
		fairly certain that we will go to Palau Weh for our dive master 
		training so will try and fly from Penang to .Medan round about 2nd - 3rd 
		March.</p>

		A quiet day of not doing much. We were up at 8ish and spent most of the 
		morning by the pool. We had lunch at Kaw Kwang. After eating, I walked 
		into Saladan and got a couple more birthday presents while Roz continued 
		to sunbathe. In Saladan, I met Anjali and found out that whale sharks 
		have been spotted at Koh Ha the last couple of days.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		At about 5:30, we both walked to the far end of the beach and walked 
		back while the sun was setting. We walked out to Sunset Restaurant for 
		tea but there were loads of people waiting for food so we gave up and 
		ate at Kaw Kwang again. We were back in the room just after 9.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 25th January 2007</font> </b>
		Were up at 7 for another days diving with Lanta Diving. We were 
		collected at 7:50 and on the boat about 15 minutes later. We were diving 
		with Anjali again as well as Tina, a German DMT and Charlotte from 
		Sweden. The first dive was at King Cruiser which we have not been to for 
		a couple of years.
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0738.jpg" width="272" height="204" align="left"></b></font>The 
		visibility was pretty poor and it was certainly not the best dive we 
		have had at this wreck. However, we did see a turtle and there was 
		plenty of other fish around. After about 30 minutes of the dive, Roz 
		started to feel ill. We continued the dive but after Charlotte and Tina 
		had left us due to being low on air, Roz indicated that she wanted to go 
		up as well and we cut short the dive by a few minutes.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Back on the boat, Roz spent half an hour or so lying down before 
		recovering and being OK for the second dive. The second dive was at Hin 
		Bida and was led by Tina. Once again the vis was poor but there was 
		enough to see to make the dive still interesting. On this dive I managed 
		to take what is probably my best ever nudibranch photograph.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were back in Saladan by 4:30 and after a beer with Anjali, we walked 
		back to Kaw Kwang. Sunset was again full when we tried to eat there so 
		we continued walking down the beach and had a pretty good meal at 
		another restaurant a bit further along. On our way back, we booked a 
		table at Sunset for tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 26th January 2007</font> </b>Another 6:45 
		start for a trip to Hin Muang and Hin Daeng. The first dive was hard 
		work and not that enjoyable due to very strong currents. The second dive 
		was much better but the visibility here is still no-where near as good 
		as it can be. The camera case sprung another leak in between dives but 
		the camera appears to have survived this time.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We did not get back to Kaw Kwang until about 6:30. After quick showers, 
		we had a couple of beers on our balcony before walking to Sunset 
		Restaurant. We had reserved a table this time so got to eat there at our 
		third attempt. We had a couple of bottles of Sang Som with the meal and 
		another in the bar next door which we do not remember too clearly.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 27th January 2007</font> </b>
		Not too badly hung-over but did not do much all day. We made it to 
		breakfast but then stayed in the room until midday. Most of the rest of 
		the day was spent reading at the pool or sat on the balcony. We walked 
		into Saladan in the evening. We spent an hour or so on the internet and 
		sent an e-mail to Lumba Lumba telling them that we want to begin DM 
		training at the beginning of March. We also wrote to a couple of travel 
		agents about flights for getting to Palau Weh. I got my hair cut and we 
		ate at Saladan Seafood before walking back to Kaw Kwang. Watched 
		Birmingham v Reading live while listening to World Service (Ipswich 1, 
		Swansea 0).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 28th January 2007</font> </b>
		Another trip to Hin Muang and Hin Daeng the diving was better today than 
		it had been two days ago. We dived with Peter, a retired German who is 
		staying in the bungalow next door to us as well as Robyn, a South 
		African woman. On the first dive, we just missed out on seeing a whale 
		shark. Peter lost his weight belt getting into the water and we had to 
		wait for him to get another. The other groups who got in at the same 
		time as us and went straight down all saw the whale shark but it was 
		no-where to be seen by the time we got in the water. On the second, 
		Robyn got sent back to the buoy line due to being low on air despite 
		her concerns that she may have to cut short her dives due to diving with 
		less experienced divers.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Once again, we were not back at Kaw Kwang until 6:30 and we had a 
		similar evening to the one on Friday. We had a couple of bottles of Sang 
		Som with our meal at Sunset and then returned to the bungalow where we 
		watched Arsenal v Bolton while drinking another half bottle.</p>
