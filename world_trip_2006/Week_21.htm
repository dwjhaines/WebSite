		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/IMG_7777.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Monday, 
		30th October 2006</font> </b>Our first days diving with Sensation 
		Divers. We were at the centre before 9, got our gear sorted out and had 
		a short walk down to the boat with all equipment being transported by 
		ox-drawn cart.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We dived at two local dive sites with a local dive guide and no other 
		divers. Both dives were excellent with loads of fish, a few things we 
		had never seen before and a turtle towards the end of the second dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Due to the short boat trip and the short surface interval time, we were 
		back at the hotel not long after midday so could have lunch on our 
		balcony again and spend the afternoon on the beach (Before going to the 
		beach, we asked the hotel's travel agent to book us on a flight from 
		Zanzibar to Tanga for 9 days time).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Ate out at a restaurant on the beach where we had spent the afternoon.</p>

		31st October 2006</font> </b>Had a two dive trip out to Nmemba Island 
		about 1<font face="Times New Roman">½ hours away by boat. Two very good 
		dives again including two turtles on the second.</font></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 1st November 2006</font> </b>
		Did three dives today including a night dive. On the boat for the first 
		two dives was a group of about 8 South Africans of varying levels of 
		experience. They seemed just as gormless as the English group in Dahab 
		had been and proved quite entertaining. We all dived in one big group 
		led by Peter, the owner of Sensation Divers. All three dives were 
		excellent again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 2nd November 2006</font> </b>
		An interesting days diving! It was a two dive trip to Leven Bank, about 
		45 minutes away by boat. We arrived at the dive centre at 8:30 and were 
		told that things had been delayed for an hour. We waited until after 10 
		for everyone to appear (about half the South Africans from yesterday) 
		and to sort out their equipment. Both the dives were deep and again, 
		there were a few inexperienced divers on the trip which caused one or 
		two problems. On the second dive, after only a 1 hour surface interval 
		time, half the 
		divers must of gone below 35m before being told to come up. The second 
		dive seemed particularly disorganised and mostly involved swimming out 
		into the blue at about 10m to keep within decompression limits. However, 
		those of us still in the water at the end of the dive did get to see a 
		manta swim round a couple of times. Everyone was cold and wet on the way 
		home due to heavy rain blowing through the boat.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		A day off diving tomorrow so we had a few beers in the evening. We 
		started with a few beers at a beach bar with happy hour during sunset, 
		had a can each on our balcony and continued drinking during tea. I only 
		vaguely remember walking back to the room.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Friday, 3rd November 2006</font> </b>We had decided to stay in Nungwi an 
		extra 4 nights instead of going back to stay in Stonetown. This meant we 
		would have to go into Stonetown for money and to sort out our transport 
		away from Zanzibar for next Wednesday. We had been told by the hotel 
		travel agent that she had been unable to book our flights to Tanga as 
		the plane was full. However, at the Coastal Aviation office we managed 
		to buy two tickets with no problems. This was very good news as it means 
		we do not need to go back to Dar and our bus journey to Moshi gets 
		shortened by about three hours.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We took out another Tshs1.2 million for flights, hotel and additional 
		diving. We also bought presents/souvenirs from one of the shops.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We travelled in both directions by dalla-dalla the local public bus 
		(Tshs1500 each way). Not too bad going into Stonetown but totally packed 
		on the return journey - not good with a hangover.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		<img border="2" src="Photos/Africa/IMG_0101.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		4th November 2006</font> </b>Another good days diving! Shane's Reef is 
		becoming one of my favourite dive sites. There is so much to see there 
		that we have not seen anywhere else particularly frog fish and leaf 
		scorpion fish. We saw the last of the South Africans on the first dive 
		and things all seemed a bit more organised on the second.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Apart from the diving, Roz had a pretty bad day all round. Before the 
		first dive, she trod on a sea urchin while walking out to the boat, 
		ending up with five spines stuck in her foot. In between dives, she 
		almost knocked herself out by walking into an ornamental boat in the 
		grounds of the hotel. Her favourite skirt got lost somehow after the 
		second dive. Sunderland lost 1 - 0 at Norwich. The sea urchin was 
		potentially the most serious but people who had seen such injuries 
		before did not seem too concerned. They put papaya juice on it at the 
		dive centre which should sort it out apparently.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We listened to the football on World Service (I found out that Swansea 
		won 4 - 2 last night) and went to our usual restaurant on the beach for 
		tea and a couple of beers.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		Sunday, 5th November 2006</font> </b>Another enjoyable, if slightly 
		strange days diving. We went to Leven Bank again with a group of four 
		&quot;Swedes&quot;, Chelsea, us and Peter and Bret. On the first dive, we failed 
		to find the reef but did see two &quot;devil&quot; rays (our manta from 3 days ago 
		was also a devil ray apparently). We finished the dive after 29 minutes 
		and then got straight back in again with the same tanks. Both times we 
		went down to about 30m but did not see a lot on the second dive.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were on our way back to Nungwi when the captain found the reef so the 
		third dive was in the right place. This was a fast drift dive over the 
		top of the reef.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		On our return to the room, I found a problem with my camera that makes 
		it unusable. A search on the internet revealed that this is quite a 
		common problem with Canon cameras - the &quot;E18 error&quot;. Knowing what the 
		problem is does not help much unless we can find a camera shop between 
		now and Saturday when we go on safari again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Roz's foot seems to be recovering from the sea urchin incident.</p>
