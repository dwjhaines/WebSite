		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_1063.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Monday, 
		19th February 2007</font> </b>We were picked up by Lanta Diver at 6:50 
		for another trip to Hin Muang and Hin Daeng. We left our luggage in the 
		dive shop as we would be returning to Time for Lime when we got back.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We dived with Anjali again and Lars and Peter from Sweden. Both dives 
		were good with better visibility than on previous trips to the same 
		sites previously. We saw an unexpected turtle on the first dive as we 
		battled with the current and there was a leopard shark at both sites 
		(although I missed it at the first one as I was photographing the 
		turtle!)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were dropped at Time for Lime by about 7. The bungalow was nicer than 
		we had thought it was yesterday and will be fine for a couple of nights. 
		We tried to eat in the Time for Lime restaurant but it is closed on 
		Mondays so we walked to Mr Wee's for another pizza instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		20th February 2007</font> </b>
		Two dives back at Koh Bida Nok and Koh Bida Nai. Visibility was poor 
		again but the dives were still OK. We were back at our room by about 
		4:30 and did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Spent an hour or so 
		trying to connect to the free wi-fi that Time for Lime is supposed to 
		have - without success. We had a couple of beers on our balcony and ate 
		in the Time for Lime restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 21st February 
		2007</font> </b>
		We checked out of Time for Lime and walked back to Golden Bay Resort 
		where we had booked an air-con room for three nights. The room was not 
		ready when we arrived so we spent an hour using the internet before 
		checking in. Not a bad room for the price (B1300) apart from the lack of 
		fridge!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spent the rest of the day on the beach. We had a session again in the 
		evening. The usual sort of thing - drinks on our balcony, a couple of 
		bottles of Sang Som with our meal at Sunset and half of a third bottle 
		that we do not remember anything about!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thursday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 22nd February 
		2007</font> </b>
		Did not really do a lot all day. Apart from getting up for breakfast, we 
		did not leave the room until 12:30 due to the effects of last nights 
		Sang Som. When we did get up, we walked into Saladan spending about 40 
		minutes on the internet before having lunch at Lanta Seafood. We booked 
		our minibus tickets to Pak Bara (from where we get the ferry to Koh Lipe) 
		for two days time, and then walked back to Golden Bay. Roz went to the 
		beach for a couple of hours while I watched the Barcelona v Liverpool 
		game on tele.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Ate at Sunset which is now only a couple of minutes walk from our 
		bungalow and had an early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0760.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left"><font size="4"><b>Friday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		23rd February 2007</font> </b>Our final days diving before we leave 
		Lanta - almost certainly for the last time on this trip. We had chosen 
		to go to Koh Ha as it is a shorter day and had two very good dives 
		again. We were diving on our own with Anjali although we did have one of 
		the recently qualified DMs following us. Also on the boat was Jan, who 
		we had dived with when on holiday here last year, and his daughter - 
		both now dive master trainees..</p>
		<p align="justify">
		On the first dive we managed to find the rhinopia (leaf scorpion fish 
		type thing) that we have been looking for unsuccessfully twice 
		previously. The visibility was very good for the rest of the dive which 
		was quite shallow due to the rhinopia being down at about 29m. The 
		second dive was also enjoyable at a part of Koh Ha #4 that we had not 
		dived previously. We had a bit of a wait for transport back to the 
		resort but were still there by 5ish.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had not planned to drink too much tonight but as it was our last 
		night and our last meal at Sunset, we still somehow managed to get 
		through almost three bottles of Sang Som.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Saturday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 24th February 
		2007</font> </b>We were picked up by a taxi at 7:45 and driven to our 
		first minibus which left roughly on time just after 8. Not too upset to 
		be leaving Lanta this time although seeing the Lanta Diver pick-up leave 
		without us was a sad moment. We have stayed here 34 nights in total so 
		it is probably time for moving on and doing something different. The 
		journey continued to run smoothly at Trang where we transferred to 
		another minibus with only about a 10 - 15 minuted wait. This minibus 
		also left roughly on time and we were in Pak Bara by 12:45. We bought 
		tickets for the 1:30 speed boat and had lunch before walking to the 
		pier.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Here things started to go wrong. The boat, which was only supposed to 
		take an hour did not leave until gone 2 and than seemed to do a tour of 
		the islands en route to Lipe giving people time to get off the boat for 
		pictures etc along the way. We got transferred to a long-tail boat at 
		Lipe at about 4:30 and got onto the island about 15 minutes later.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The next problem was that the room that we had booked through a dive 
		centre here was not available. The hotel had no record of the booking 
		and neither the resort or the dive operator seemed overly bothered about 
		doing anything about the problem. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_0767.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="right">We left our luggage there while we 
		walked along the beach trying to find an available room. We got 
		something eventually, but at B1100 for a fan room, it seems very over 
		priced. By this time we were both knackered and had to take the first 
		room we found but will probably do something about moving tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the evening we went round a couple of other resorts - all cheaper 
		than where we are staying but also all full. We will try again tomorrow 
		as people are checking out for the early ferry. We asked at a dive 
		centre (not the one that had cocked up our accommodation!) about diving 
		in the area and will probably dive again on Monday. We ate at a 
		restaurant on the beach and returned to our room to listen to the 
		football on World Service (Yeovil 1, Swansea 0)</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 25th February 
		2007</font> </b>After breakfast, we found a couple of rooms available a 
		bit further along the same beach from where we were staying. We took the 
		second room we saw at Daya Resort. It was the better of the two and 
		slightly cheaper. At B400, it was a lot better value than last night.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Did not do a lot for the rest of the day. Spent most of the time reading 
		either on the beach or on the balcony. We went for a walk round the 
		island to see the other beaches which did not appear as nice as the one 
		we are at. Booked ourselves on a three dive day trip for tomorrow. Ate 
		at our resort's restaurant.</p>
