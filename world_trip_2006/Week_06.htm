		Monday,
		17th July 2006</font> </b>After a few days of visiting friends and 
		relatives, we left Nottingham to begin the second leg of our World trip. 
		We had an uneventful drive down to Gatwick stopping for a pub lunch in 
		Reigate just before we got there. After a bit of confusion, the car was 
		collected from outside South terminal and we went off to try flying 
		EasyJet for the first time. There was more confusion when we arrived in 
		the terminal due to the luggage belt being broken, but this was soon 
		fixed and check-in was a lot quicker than expected. We killed a couple 
		of hours in the departure lounge before another uneventful journey, 
		arriving in Venice at about 21:30, only 40 minutes later than expected. 
		All in all, not a bad flight for £26 each.</p>
		<p align="justify">We got the public bus into Venice for
		<font face="Times New Roman">€2 each </font>and had about a 20 minute 
		walk to our hotel. Checked in, had showers and went straight to sleep.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Europe_0006.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="left">Tuesday,
		18th July 2006</font></b> After breakfast, we had a quick trip to bus 
		and train stations to get information for leaving Venice in two days 
		time. We then began our sight-seeing. We started with a journey along 
		the Grand Canal on a Vaporetto, a water bus type thing which took us 
		from the bus station area all the way to Piazza S. Marco. It was a very 
		enjoyable 40 minute journey, taking in all the sights along the canal. 
		St Marks Square itself was too crowded with tourists to be described as 
		enjoyable and we did not bother joining the queues to get into the 
		cathedral or the tower. We went from there to the Bridge of Sighs and 
		onto the Rialto Bridge which were also very crowded. However, away from 
		the main attractions, it was all quite pleasant wandering around the 
		streets and canals with far fewer people.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Europe_0035.JPG" width="205" height="154" align="right">After 
		a pizza slice for lunch, we headed back to the area where our hotel is, 
		Cannaregio, found an excellent wine shop and somehow ended up buying 1.5 
		litres of draught white wine for <font face="Times New Roman">€3. We 
		also found a few nice looking places for eating and drinking later on.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We started on the wine 
		at about 6ish, drinking 1 litre of it before leaving the hotel. We then 
		went to some of the &quot;Osterias&quot; we had seen earlier. These were similar 
		to tapas bars in Spain and all served half litres of reasonable white 
		wine for €4 - 5. After visiting 5 of these, we made it back to the hotel 
		by about 11:30.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Wednesday</b></font><b><font size="4">,
		19th July 2006</font></b> Roz was quite hung-over today so while she 
		slept, I went to the station to buy train tickets for tomorrow and also 
		went for a walk around the area we had been drinking in last night. She 
		had recovered by midday and we spent a few more hours wandering around 
		the sights. We walked a different route to St Mark's Square and then 
		crossed the Grand Canal on the only bridge we had yet to use. We went to 
		the church on the opposite side of the canal to St Mark's and then made 
		our way back to the hotel stopping in the same place as yesterday for a 
		late lunch. In the evening we found a restaurant in the streets behind 
		our hotel and had a pizza and an early night. 1st alcohol free day since 
		18th June!</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>
		<img border="0" src="Photos/Europe_0062.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="left">Thursday</b></font><b><font size="4">,
		20th July 2006</font></b> Spent the day travelling to Rovinj on the 
		Croatian coast. We got the 9:10 train from Venice station which got us 
		into Trieste at about midday. The next bus for Rovinj was not until 3pm. 
		We did not want to pay the daily rate to leave our rucksacks in left 
		luggage so had lunch (bought from a supermarket) in the park opposite 
		the bus station and then waited in the bus station for the last hour. 
		The bus took us through Slovenia and into Croatia, arriving in Rovinj at 
		17:15. It was a fairly enjoyable way of spending the day as both train 
		and bus were no-where near full.</p>
		<p align="justify">We found the room that Roz had booked in 
		advance, only a short walk from the bus station. The room was ideal - 
		air-con, a fridge and a decent size balcony that just about overlooked 
		the sea (The room also came with free wireless broadband through 
		someone's un-secure connection which was a bit of a bonus!). We spent an hour sunbathing on the balcony before heading off 
		for a look around Rovinj. We were not too impressed initially but once 
		we had found our way to the old town, it seemed a pretty nice little 
		place. We went back to the room for a beer on our balcony and then went 
		out for a pizza. The plan of cutting down on food by ordering one pizza 
		between us failed to work but we had a very enjoyable evening anyway 
		getting through one and a half litres of wine with the meal.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Friday</b></font><b><font size="4">,
		21st July 2006</font></b> We had breakfast on our balcony and then went 
		for a wander through the streets of the old town which was all quite 
		pleasant without being too spectacular. We returned to the balcony at 
		lunchtime to finish last nights pizza.</p>
		<p align="justify">Our plans for the next 7 days are a bit vague but we 
		managed to contact Croatia Divers on Korcula and they arranged for us to 
		do two days diving with them and sorted out our accommodation from next 
		Thursday. We were also not sure how long we would stay in Rovinj. We had 
		planned to leave on Sunday but decided that Monday may be a better day 
		to be travelling. We decided to check how good the beach was before 
		finalising our plans and at 2ish, we headed off to the beach. It was 
		about a 25 minute walk to get to the beach but once there it was 
		very nice. Still no sand, as with a lot of Croatia's beaches but&nbsp; 
		it was comfortable to lie on and easy to get in and out of the water 
		compared to some places. Spent a couple of hours sunbathing before 
		returning to our room. Our room was not available for Sunday night but 
		we managed to book another room at the same place instead.</p>
		<p align="justify">Spent the evening with another &quot;Jumbo&quot; pizza and a 
		couple of litres of wine.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Saturday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		22nd July 2006</font></b> A similar day to yesterday - walked around old 
		town, leftover pizza on the balcony for lunch, a couple of hours trying 
		to get information for the next month's travel (making the most of the 
		free internet access) and a couple of hours on the same beach as 
		yesterday. Had a couple of litres of wine on the balcony with a takeaway 
		pizza in the evening.</p>
		<p align="justify">Decided today that a few alcohol free, healthy eating 
		days were required as I was feeling decidedly unhealthy following Germany 
		and the drinking that has taken place in the last couple of weeks. I 
		also still have the sore throat that I have had on and off since before 
		the world cup. Will start tomorrow!</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		23rd July 2006</font></b> We changed rooms to another just over the 
		corridor by 11 (almost identical room but no balcony) and shortly after, 
		we went out and hired bikes for a few hours. We did not cycle very far 
		but went a few km around the coast, stopping for picnic lunch along the 
		way and spending a couple of hours at another beach before cycling home.</p>
		<p align="justify">We went back to the same pizza place as we went to on 
		our first two nights here and had another jumbo pizza before an 
		alcohol-free early night.</p>
