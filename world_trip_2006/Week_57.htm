		Left Kingsclere just before 7 and had a pretty good journey down to 
		Dover. We were at Western Docks by 9:30 and had a wait of just over an 
		hour for the ferry. The ferry left on time and by 1 we had arrived in 
		Boulogne. We stopped at a couple of hyper-markets to stock up on wine 
		and some French beer before continuing on to Ghent. We arrived in Ghent 
		at 5ish and after a few problems finding our way into the centre and 
		then parking the car, we checked into the same Ibis that we had been in 
		exactly a year ago.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We headed out to Het Waterhuis where we had a couple of drinks before 
		moving on to t Galgenhuisje. We&nbsp; then went out to The 
		Trappistenhuis where we stayed for the remainder of the evening. A 
		remarkably similar night out to the 10th July last year!</p>

		We had breakfast and a walk around the city centre buying chocolates on 
		the way back. After showers back at the hotel we headed off to start the 
		days drinking at 2ish. We went off in the direction of the Hop Duvel 
		stopping for a couple on the way. Spent most of the afternoon in the Hop 
		Duvel before walking back to the centre. Spent the evening in a 
		selection of bars in the centre and vaguely remember being in Het Waterhuis 
		sometime around midnight.</p>

		Checked out of the hotel at 11 and after managing to get out of the car 
		park without too many problems, we drove to the Hop Duvel shop where we 
		spent over €100 on beer. We added to the selection by stocking up on 
		some of the less rare beers at a supermarket and then headed North to 
		Ostend where we were to spend the last night of our world trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We went out for a walk around Ostend at 4ish - it was a bit like 
		visiting a English sea-side resort in winter! We did however find an 
		excellent bar with a range of about 280 beers so settled in there for 
		the final session of the trip. We spent 3 - 4 hours in the same place 
		drinking mainly stronger beers. We were both pissed by the time we left 
		here and only managed one other bar before returning to the room by 
		about 9. A very enjoyable way of spending our last night abroad.</p>

		were back in Dover by 2</p>
