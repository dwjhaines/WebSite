		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe/IMG_5721.JPG" width="272" height="204" align="left">Monday, 2nd July 2007</font> </b>Got to the dive centre and were told 
		that we would be diving down South again. We had already decided that we 
		would not bother with another trip down South so we said we would have a 
		day off instead. However, we were then given the option of joining a 
		group of 18 divers from a club in Manchester who were heading for the 
		Canyon and Bells - Blue Hole. This seemed a far better choice of sites 
		and also meant that we could return to bed for an hour or so to sleep 
		off our hangovers before diving. Once again, it was two good dives and a 
		good day out.</p>

		Could not be bothered to walk into Dahab to eat so had a chicken balti at the 
		Bedouin Moon and an early night.</p>

		Dived at Eel Garden and Islands returning to the hotel in between. We 
		dived with Mohammed (Big Mo as opposed to Little Mo who we dived with 
		yesterday) and Jane who we dived with a couple of days ago. Eel Garden 
		was a nice enough dive and Islands was very good as usual. The location 
		of the dives gave us a bit more time for lying by the pool for a few 
		hours during the day, something we have not been able to do much since 
		we have been here. </p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a few beers and a takeaway in the evening but managed to avoid 
		getting as pissed as we did a couple of nights ago.</p>

		Not a good start to the day as Roz received an e-mail from Divetours 
		stating that our liveaboard left on the Sunday as it was supposed to and 
		we would not be able to get a refund. Decided not to worry about it 
		until we get home!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Our last two dives of the World Trip. We dived with Mark and were the 
		only two customers so we had the choice of where to go. We chose to do 
		the two dives at the Blue Hole again, the first from Bells and the 
		second to the right of the Blue Hole. Both very nice dives again and a 
		good way to finish. We ended the dive with over 480 logged dives meaning 
		that I have logged 280 in the last year (Roz has 283 due to three more 
		in Pulah Weh). Back at the hotel by 2 so plenty of time to wash our gear 
		and spend a couple of hours by the pool.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a few beers again in the evening. Usual sort of thing - a few on the 
		balcony, a few in Adam's Bar, three more with the meal at El Fanar and 
		back to Adam's Bar before getting a taxi back to the hotel. Ended the 
		night by finishing the end of the duty free on our balcony.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 5th July 2007</font> </b>
		A lazy morning spent mainly lying around in bed. We paid our bill at the 
		dive centre and collected up all our dive gear and made it up to the 
		pool by about midday. Picked up by minibus at 3 and driven to Sharm 
		airport. Plane departed about an hour late at 7 and we were back in 
		Gatwick by 11. Made it back to Kingsclere just after 1am.</p>
