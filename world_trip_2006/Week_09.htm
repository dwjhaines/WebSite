		<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
		Monday, 
		7th August 2006</font> </b>Spent most of the day travelling from Kotor 
		to Tirana in Albania. The first direct bus to the town nearest the 
		border was at 10:50 but we&nbsp; decided to get to the bus station 
		early, keep on getting local buses in the direction that we wanted to go 
		and see how far we got. This worked quite smoothly at first. We got the 
		7:00 bus to Bar and almost immediately got on another bus, the 9:10 to Ulcinj where we arrived at about 10:00. We needed to get a bus from 
		there across the border but after a lot of asking around, found that 
		there was nothing going in that direction until 1pm. We spent an hour 
		wandering around trying to find other options but eventually went back 
		to the bus station and got a taxi to take us for €30. The transport 
		system in Albania apparently grinds to a halt after 2pm and we did not 
		want to risk arriving after this time and being unable to reach Tirana.</p>
		<p align="justify">Lonely Planet described the journey from Ulcinj to 
		Shkodra as being 17km and 40 minutes. It turned out to be a lot longer 
		than this both in terms of distance and time. It took us about 25 
		minutes to reach the border and then about 90 minutes to get through 
		it, the main delay being the Albanian border guards who took over an 
		hour to process about 20 - 25 cars. We eventually got our passports 
		stamped and were driven, fairly quickly to Shkodra, 13km the other side 
		of the border. Shkodra did not look the sort of place that you would 
		choose to spend the night, or any time at all really, and we were 
		pleased to be dropped at the minibus station for minibuses (or furgons) 
		to Tirana. We did not have to wait long for the minibus to fill up and 
		we were on our way by 1:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0298.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">The journey to Tirana was shorter than expected and 
		we arrived near the centre at about 3. The bus conductor found one of 
		the passengers who was walking into the centre and he escorted us the 
		1km or so into the main square. Tirana did not look a wonderful city at 
		first sight and after the journey that we had just had, we were not keen 
		on having to spend too much time looking for a room so we relieved to 
		get a room in the fist place we tried (recommended by LP). Another nice 
		room with air-con and free internet access for €40 a night including 
		breakfast.</p>
		<p align="justify">Sight-seeing did not take too long as there does not 
		seem to be anything too spectacular here to see. The main square is 
		quite interesting with clock tower and mosque, but still very communist 
		looking and a lot of the city still looks in need of some renovation. I 
		got my hair cut for just over £1 and we bought our souvenir bunker 
		ashtray but we were back in the room after just over an hour.</p>
		<p align="justify">We made the most out of the free wireless internet 
		that we could access from our room and then went out to sample our first 
		traditional Albanian meal. We could not understand the menu but the 
		waiter bought us a series of traditional dishes. We did not really know 
		what most of it was but it was all reasonably tasty and made a change 
		from pizza.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Tues</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		8th August 2006</font> </b>The place we were staying in was American 
		owned and did an excellent breakfast - Mexican omelette and our first 
		cup of tea in ages. We checked out of the room and the manager of the 
		hotel got a taxi for us to take us to the bus station for minibuses to 
		Berati. This led to some confusion as the taxi driver took us to a car 
		park behind a petrol station with one or two buses but no signs of 
		customers or ticket offices etc. After a bit of a disagreement, the taxi 
		driver took us to the minibus stop where we immediately got into a 
		furgon. 
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0303.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">The furgons are quite comfortable so it was a reasonably 
		enjoyable three hour drive to Berati. On arrival there, we went to the 
		hotel described by Lonely Planet as &quot;the best budget B&amp;B in Albania and 
		got our cheapest room of trip so far (€25 including breakfast).</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We 
		went straight out to see the sights of Berati which seemed a much nicer 
		place than Tirana. We wandered down to the centre of the town checked 
		bus times for tomorrow and had lunch. We then headed up to the citadel 
		above the city. This was all quite interesting in itself and gave 
		excellent views looking back over the town. Berati was also reasonably 
		interesting with plenty of different styles of buildings as well as the 
		communist concrete blocks. There was nothing there that was too 
		spectacular but it was a very good place to stopover on our way South.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had our evening meal in the restaurant on the ground floor of our 
		hotel. Excellent meal and I had my fist taste of Albanian raki.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0321.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Wednes</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		9th August 2006</font> </b>We had another really good breakfast, 
		slightly more traditional than yesterdays, and walked back down to the 
		bus station for the 8am bus to Saranda. This turned out to a very 
		enjoyable journey of just over six hours. The bus was probably the 
		oldest one in the bus station but was reasonably comfortable. Being 
		older also meant it did not have air-con so we were sat by an open 
		window. There was plenty to look at out of the window for most of the 
		journey. Initially we went through a few small towns with plenty going 
		on. Then the scenery became very spectacular with large mountain ranges 
		on either side of the road. Towards the end of the journey we had to 
		climb up to a high pass through one of the ranges to get through to the 
		coast. Along the way there were plenty of the concrete bunkers of which 
		there are about 700,000 dotted around the country.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0325.JPG" width="269" height="202" align="right">We 
		arrived at the seaside resort of Saranda just after 2 and walked down to 
		the hotel we had booked on the sea front. Once again it was an excellent 
		room - the accommodation has been one of the highlights of Albania. The 
		beach here is nothing special (stones again) but the place is nice 
		enough and is ideal for a couple of nights before we head to Corfu. We 
		had lunch and wandered along to the port to find out details of ferry 
		times for Friday and did not do a lot else for the rest of the day.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Had a couple of beers on our balcony, which just about overlooks the 
		sea, in the evening and ate out in the restaurant of the hotel next 
		door.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 
		10th August 2006</font> </b>I was woken up at about 2 by another 
		spectacular thunder storm. However this one did not clear quickly like 
		some of the others we have seen on this trip and it was wet windy and 
		surprisingly cold when we got up at about 8. It showed no sign of 
		clearing by the time we had breakfast so we decided that it may be a 
		good idea to leave for Corfu today instead of tomorrow. We spent half an 
		hour at an internet cafe and got the number of the hotel we had booked 
		in Corfu so we could let them know we were arriving a day early and 
		checked out of our hotel by 11:15. The weather appeared to brighten up 
		briefly but it was raining heavily again as we departed on the 1pm boat 
		so it looked as if we had made the right decision.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The journey across to Corfu Town only took about 40 minutes but with the 
		clocks going forward an hour, it was gone three by the time we had 
		cleared Greek customs. We had a mile or so walk to get to the local bus 
		station (moved since we were last here) and we got the 4:00 bus to 
		Pelekas. We had another short walk on arrival at Pelekas to get to our 
		room. Pelekas is a really nice small village high up on a hill with 
		great views of the sea and a few really nice looking restaurants. It is 
		a long way back up from the beach but there is a free bus shuttle 
		service so this should not be a problem. I really liked the place 
		although Roz was not so impressed!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We eventually got a room with a balcony overlooking the sea - not as 
		good value as our Albanian rooms have been but an excellent location 
		nonetheless. We spent an hour or so in the sun on the balcony and then 
		went out to buy beer and wine for a few drinks before eating. We ate in 
		Alexandros's restaurant, part of the hotel we are in. The food was 
		excellent, far better than I remember Greek food and the souvlaki were 
		nothing like the ones we used to eat 20 years ago! Also got through a 
		litre of wine and half a litre of retsina during the meal followed by 
		another drink on the balcony so it was quite late by the time we got to 
		bed.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The temperature here is excellent and for the first time in ages it was 
		cool enough to wear long trousers in the evening. Far cooler than it has 
		been in either Croatia or Germany.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0337.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="left">Friday, 
		11th August 2006</font> </b>Had a relatively late breakfast and at 11ish we walked 
		out of Pelekas towards Vatos to visit some of the places that we knew 20 
		years ago. Vatos village is only about 3 or 4 km from Pelakas, mainly 
		downhill so it was a fairly easy walk. Surprisingly Pam Pam's was still 
		there. It did not look any different to when we were here last time. We 
		walked down to Camping Vatos which apart from the addition of a swimming 
		pool, was also remarkably similar to how it was 20 years ago. It was 
		strange seeing the place where we alw<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0341.JPG" width="266" height="200" align="right">ays 
		used to camp as well as the bar and restaurant in exactly the same 
		places. Even the shower blocks were in the same place and had not been 
		modernised! A few other places had either changed beyond recognition, 
		closed down or disappeared but after a bit of effort, we managed to 
		locate Spyro's Taverna again. This had been modernised slightly but was 
		basically still the same.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		As we were in the area we decided we would go to Myrtiotissa beach. We 
		walked as far as the point where you could see the beach for the first 
		time and saw how much smaller the beach was than it had once been. It 
		was also totally packed with a steady flow of people heading down to it. 
		We decided not to bother and walked back up the hill to the road and on 
		to Glyfadda. By the time we got there, we had been walking for over 
		three and a half hours and were totally knackered. Glyfadda also was far 
		more crowded than I remember it but it had the advantage of the free 
		shuttle bus back to Pelekas at 5:15 so we did not have to walk back up 
		the hill.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/Europe_0361.JPG" width="200" height="266" align="left">When 
		we got back to the room, Roz checked her mobile for messages and 
		discovered that her mum had had an accident and was in hospital with a 
		broken arm. This was to have quite an effect on our plans for the next 
		week!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a similar evening to yesterday apart from eating in a different 
		restaurant.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Saturday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		12th August 2006</font> </b>We got the 10:30 bus into Corfu Town. We had 
		planned to find out options for travelling to Athens but due to Roz's 
		mum's accident, Roz had decided that she should fly home or a couple of 
		days. The flight prices were cheaper than expected (about €330 return) 
		and we discovered that it was possible to include the England v Greece 
		game in the trip so I decided that I may as well go back as well. We 
		spent a while in an internet cafe checking the options and then went 
		back to the travel agent and booked tickets. We are flying to Birmingham 
		(on different flights) on Monday afternoon and flying back to Athens 
		from Heathrow on 
		Thursday. We returned to the internet cafe and ordered our England 
		tickets and also booked a hire car for the trip.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was gone 2 by the time we had our flights sorted out and tickets 
		printed. We headed off for a walk around the old town and visited 
		McDonalds for lunch. We failed to find &quot;the milk bar&quot; but the old town 
		was all quite nice for walking around. By 4 we went for our first beer 
		of the day and then got the 5 o'clock bus back to Pelekas.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We could just about pick up World Service from our balcony so had a 
		couple of hours listening to the football again (Oldham 1 Swansea 0, 
		Sunderland also lost). We had a few drinks on our balcony before 
		going down to eat in Alexandros' restaurant again. Had a few more to 
		drink than on previous nights and got to bed at about 1am.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sunday</b></font><b><font size="4">, 
		13th August 2006</font> </b>Had a late breakfast again and walked down 
		to Pelekas beach at mid-day. Spent 4 hours on the beach getting burnt 
		and then got the 4:45 shuttle bus back to Pelekas village. While having 
		drinks on our balcony, we watched another spectacular storm pass by a 
		couple of miles out to sea. By the time we went to eat it was quite cold 
		again. Had a final evening meal in Alexandros' restaurant.</p>
