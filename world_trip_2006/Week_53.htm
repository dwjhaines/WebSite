		Checked out of the hotel at 7:45 and caught the 8:11 train into Riga. We 
		were in Riga by 9:30 and walked to the hotel we had booked in the old 
		town. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we left our luggage at 
		the hotel and went off to see the sights. We started doing the Lonely 
		Planet walking tour as the first part of this took in most of what we 
		wanted to see.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We walked round a few churches and other old buildings which were all 
		quite impressive. Also went to the Freedom Monument and managed to time 
		our visit with a visit from the Estonian president. We sampled the local 
		pancakes before returning to the hotel and checking into our room. We 
		went out and started drinking at 3ish. We had planned to have a couple 
		of drinks and return to the hotel for showers but the discovery of a 
		happy hour with 90p a pint Franziskaner put an end to that! Ended the 
		evening in a Belgium Beer Cafe across the road from our hotel and 
		inevitably do not remember getting home.</p>

		Apart from getting up for breakfast, we did not leave the room until 
		1ish. We continued our sightseeing starting off with a trip to the top 
		of a church tower for good views of the city. Apart from that, we spent 
		a couple of hours just wandering around the old city again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had a few more drinks again in the evening. Started off at the happy 
		hour again and continued drinking until about 11 before heading back to 
		the hotel.</p>

		Checked out of the hotel and got a local bus out to the airport. Plane 
		left just about on time at 11:10 and got into Stanstead at 11:40 local 
		time. We picked up a hire car and joined the traffic jams on the M25 
		again.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Got back to Kingsclere at 3ish and spent most of the rest of the day 
		trying to get our phone reconnected!</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Thurs</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 14th June 2007</font> </b>Got up 
		and drove down to Swansea. Dropped the car off at Forrestfach where we 
		met Mum before driving down to Llansteffan. We were joined by Jane and 
		Ayla for tea and ended up getting through five bottles of wine between 
		us. Got to bed by about 1am.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 15th June 2007</font> </b>Had to get back to 
		Kingsclere by 1 to wait for a BT engineer to come and look at our phone 
		socket. When he did turn up, he could not fix the problem but said 
		someone else would have to come out and reconnect us. Still no phone 
		line so no internet.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Spoke to Christina in the afternoon and found out that I have a job at 
		Ericsson to go back to. This could not have worked out a lot better for 
		me as I do not even have to go to an interview. Very good news. Started 
		preparing for redecorating the house - took all office furniture to the 
		tip and bought paint, etc but did not actually start doing any painting.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Went out for a couple of pints at Aldermaston after all the thought 
		about decorating. Had a couple more in the house with tea and a couple 
		more down The Swan. It did not seem to have changed a lot - same people, 
		same beer - quite an enjoyable evening.</p>

		Drove down to Bognor to go for lunch with Dad and Doris. Dad not up to 
		going out due to COPD so had pizza in the bungalow instead. As cheerful 
		a visit as ever but we were away by 3 and back in Kingsclere by 4:30. 
		Went out on our bikes for an hour or so but the weather was still not 
		really hot enough for beer gardens so we just cycled 11 - 12 miles. Had 
		our second meal in a row from Domino's while watching tele and had an 
		early night.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		Up at 6:30 to drive to Gatwick for the 10:45 flight to Sharm. We parked 
		very close to the airport and checked in after about 45 minutes of 
		queuing. Flight left just about on time and arrived in Sharm at 6ish 
		local time. We sorted out our visas and got our luggage without any 
		problems but then things started to go wrong!</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were supposed to be collected at the airport and be transferred to 
		the MV Orchid for a six night live-aboard. There was no-one there to 
		meet us which was slightly concerning. Sharm airport has free wifi so we 
		went onto the internet to try and find contact details of someone we 
		could talk to and found that the MV Orchid now departs every Saturday 
		and left yesterday. We tried to contact Dive Tours who we had booked the 
		whole trip with but were unable to get through to them. We had no real 
		option but to get a taxi into Sharm and try and find a room for the 
		night. Once in Sharm, we managed to get through to Graham from Dive 
		Tours but he was out of the office and could not do a lot. We checked 
		into The Camel Hotel for the night and started to look for other 
		possible liveaboards.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We were both knackered by this time and could not be bothered to go out 
		to eat. Finished off our sandwiches with a couple of bottles of beer and 
		our duty free Bacardi in the room instead.</p>
