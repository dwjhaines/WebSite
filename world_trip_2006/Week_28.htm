		Monday, 18th December 2006</font> </b>We had breakfast, spent an hour or 
		so by the pool and checked out of the hotel just before 11. We carried 
		all our stuff down to the pier and got on the 11:30 boat to Lanta. We 
		arrived in Lanta just over an hour later and got a taxi to Kaw Kwang 
		Resort. We checked into the bungalow that we had booked when we were 
		here in March, just behind where the bungalow was that we checked out of 
		exactly six years ago today. It was really good to be back and it meant 
		that we could finally unpack the Christmas things that we have been 
		carrying for the last few weeks. Hopefully this will be the last time 
		that we will have to travel with so much luggage. We are booked in to 
		Kaw Kwang for 15 nights - the longest we will have stayed in the same 
		place since leaving home in June.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		After unpacking everything, we walked into Saladan for lunch and also 
		called into Lanta Divers to sort out our diving for the next couple of 
		weeks. Again everything seemed to be very efficiently organised. We are 
		booked to dive three days this week, again on Christmas day and three 
		days the following week when Regan and Annette do their advanced course. 
		We walked back to Kaw Kwang and spent what was left of the afternoon by 
		the pool although it was not particularly sunny. I ran the length of the 
		beach and back just after 5 while Roz sorted out the Christmas lights 
		that we had bought in Chiang Mai.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We ate on the beach in the German run restaurant that we had eaten in 
		several times when we were here in March. Another excellent meal and a 
		few bottles of Chang (Leo does not seem to have made it to this part of 
		Thailand).</p>
		<p align="justify">

		We were collected from Kaw Kwang at 7:40 by Lanta Divers. We met Anjali, 
		who we have dived with before at the dive centre and found that we were 
		diving with her again as requested. We were also diving with a Dutch 
		couple, Rose and Vincent, who are both dive masters.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was a good days diving. We went to two dive sites just South of Phi 
		Phi, Koh Bida Nok and Koh Bida Nai. Two good dives with a turtle being 
		spotted fairly soon after the start of the first. I managed to stub my 
		toe on the boat in between dives but other than that it was a very 
		enjoyable start to our diving here. We were back in Lanta just after 
		three so had time for an hour by the pool before the sun set.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		My toe was quite bruised and swollen by the time we were back and it 
		made walking difficult, so no running for a few days! We ate in the Kaw 
		Kwang restaurant - excellent and very spicy food. We had a a couple of 
		beers on our balcony before and after the meal as well as a couple of 
		bottles of Chang while we ate. Quite light-headed by the time we went to 
		bed.</p>

		20th December 2006</font> </b>
		We were supposed to be diving at Hin Daeng and Hin Muang today so were 
		picked up from Kaw Kwang at 6:40. After an hour or so of the boat trip, 
		there was a change of plan due to the strong winds and choppy sea and we 
		diverted to Koh Ha instead. This did not turn out too badly as we had 
		two pretty good dives at Koh Ha. The first dive featured a 
		few caves, one of which you could surface inside of. It was a dive that 
		we had done with Dive Zone six years ago. During this dive there 
		were strong thermoclines that were not only very cold but also produced 
		strong up currents. The second dive was easier and better with plenty to 
		see. Dived with Anjali again and two English blokes. Due to the early 
		start and the shorter than anticipated boat journey, we were back in 
		Lanta soon after3.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had an hour or so by the pool and started drinking at 6. Usual sort 
		of Thailand session - a couple of beers on the balcony, a couple of 
		bottles of Sang Som in a restaurant on the beach and another half bottle 
		on the balcony that neither of us remember! My toe was still quite 
		painful today. It was not too bad for diving but was not really up to 
		walking into Saladan as we had planned. Still very bruised and swollen.</p>
		<p align="justify">

		21st December 2006</font> </b>
		We got up for breakfast but then returned to bed until after midday. Not 
		too hung-over once we did get up. I walked into Saladan to get another 
		couple of Christmas things leaving Roz to sort out the Christmas lights 
		for our balcony. My toe was still bad but walking did not seem to make 
		it any worse.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		It was gone three by the time I was back. We had lunch in the hotel 
		restaurant and stayed by the pool for the what was left of the 
		afternoon. We both went into Saladan in the evening. We had a look round 
		some of the shops and spent half an hour or so looking at the internet. 
		Found out that there is a problem with fog in England at the moment 
		causing flight cancellations. Regan and Annette have already had their 
		flights changed and could have problems leaving England. Also looked at 
		the web site of Lumba Lumba dive centre in Pulau Weh, Indonesia.
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/IMG_2280.JPG" width="194" height="259" align="right">We 
		are considering doing DM training in February and Anjali has recommended 
		this place to us. It all looked pretty good and this is probably the 
		place we are most likely to go for.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We had planned to eat in one of the sea food restaurants in Saladan but 
		ended up going for a pizza instead. After eating, we stocked up on beer 
		and got a taxi back to Kaw Kwang.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<b><font size="4">Friday, 22nd December 2006</font> </b>Our second 
		aborted trip to Hin Daeng and Hin Muang. This time we got closer to the 
		dive sites than two days ago and were only about 45 minutes away before 
		the weather changed and we had to turn around. We dived the two sites at 
		Koh Ha again. Both were good dives and it was another enjoyable day 
		despite not getting to the better sites. We were back in Saladan by 
		about 4:30 and we stayed for a couple of beers with some of the Lanta 
		Diver staff and the two other divers that we had dived with.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		We got a taxi back to Kaw Kwang at 6ish and continued drinking. We had a few 
		more beers on the balcony and a half bottle of Sang Som with tea in Kaw 
		Kwang restaurant. Ended up drinking more than we had planned! We discovered during the evening that Regan 
		has made it successfully to Thailand and should be with us tomorrow.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Satur</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 23rd December 2006</font> </b>
		We were woken at 7 by someone from Lanta Diver who thought that we 
		should be diving today. We returned to sleep but were up and in 
		breakfast reasonably early anyway. We walked into Saladan to use the 
		internet and stock up with more alcohol for the next few sessions. Had a 
		few hours by the pool either side of lunch.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img border="2" src="Photos/SE_Asia/Asia_0203.JPG" width="259" height="194" align="left">Regan and Annette arrived in Lanta at about 4:30 and called to let us 
		know they were here. We walked down to Summer House, where they are 
		staying but only saw Regan due to Annette being in bed with a cold! We 
		returned to Kaw Kwang for showers and then walked back to Summer House 
		for a few beers on their balcony. We ate at the place on the beach that 
		we had been to on Wednesday - good food and cheaper than the German 
		place. We started on the Sang Som with the meal and got through a total 
		of six bottles between us. Do not remember walking back at about 1:30.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font size="4"><b>Sun</b></font><b><font size="4">day, 24th December 2006</font> </b>
		Apart from breakfast, I did not make it out of bed until midday again. 
		We walked into Saladan to meet Regan and Annette for lunch at Lanta 
		Seafood. We left them sorting out their diving with Lanta Diver and 
		walked back for an hour or so by the pool. Regan and Annette made it to 
		Kaw Kwang in the evening. We ate in our restaurant and had a couple of 
		beers but no-one was really drinking and we were in bed before 10.</p>
