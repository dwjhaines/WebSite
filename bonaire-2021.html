            This was a trip to Bonaire that had been booked in December 2019. It was initially booked for September last year and has had to be moved at least twice. It has been a long wait and we have now gone almost two years without diving but it looked as if we were finally able to go. The UK is still on Bonaire's "Red List" so as well as all the pre-departure paperwork and certificates that we needed to complete, we were required to get a PCR test in the 48 hours before departure. We just about had to get this done at Heathrow so left home a day early and booked a night at the Heathrow Ibis.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left Kingsclere at 2pm and were at the Ibis by 3. Straight after checking in, we walked out to the Radison Blu Hotel about half a mile back along the A4 where there is a Randox testing centre in the car park. It took about 5 minutes to get tested and we were told that we would have the results by midnight. We both needed to test negative to be able to fly tomorrow morning. We walked back to the Ibis, had our free drink in the bar and headed out for the evening.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided to go out in Richmond. This involved getting a bus to Feltham and then a ten minute train journey to Richmond. We had five Cask Marque pubs that we wanted to visit. The first, One Kew Street, only had Doombar so we did not stay. The Railway was a Nicholson's Pub which was better. We had one in there before walking to The Duke's Head, probably the best pub of the evening. While we were in here, we both received an e-mail saying that we had tested negative. The e-mail contained our test certificate, the final piece of paperwork that we required to be allowed to fly and meant in theory that there was nothing now that could stop us getting to Bonaire. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had one in The Victoria before stopping for a free cocktail at The Pitcher and Piano. We had one in The Cricketers to complete our Cask Marque pub crawl and then stopped for another in The Tap Tavern. This had sounded quite a good pub and was alright but did not have a great selection of beers. We walked back to the station and got the train back to Feltham where we had one in the Wetherspoons before getting the bus to the hotel. We had sandwiches and a glass of wine in the room before getting to bed by about 10:30
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 26th October</span>
            We were both awake by 4:15 so had time for quick showers before checking out and driving the short distance to Terminal 3. We left the car with the Meet and Greet service in the Short Stay car park and walked into the terminal to check in. Check-in took slightly longer than usual as all our paperwork had to be checked but there were no queues and it all went relatively smoothly. Getting through security was very quick and by about 5:45 we were at the gate with our breakfast. The flight left slightly before the scheduled 6:30 departure time and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a wait of about three hours before our 11:50 flight to Bonaire. We resisted the temptation to go directly to the bar and sat around for an hour or so taking it in turns to go and look around the airport. At 10, we did return to our usual bar (Taste of the Lowlands) for the traditional pre-flight beer. The beer from the t'IJ brewery that we usually have had been removed from the menu but it had been replaced with beers from a couple of other Dutch breweries so not the end of the world. We just had the one drink before making our way to the gate about an hour before departure.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The flight was almost totally full so took a while to load meaning that we took off slightly late but other than that, once again, everything went reasonably smoothly. Apart from having to wear masks all the time it was not really any different to any other flight. The service was a bit slow to start but once we had eaten and everything had been cleared away, things improved and we were able to get a few bottles of wine. We had to stop drinking earlier than usual as the flight was going directly to Bonaire instead of going via Aruba but it was an enjoyable few hours anyway.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We landed in Bonaire slightly early at 3:25pm. Before going through immigration, we had all our paperwork checked again and had to book another PCR test for day 5 of our stay, again due to The UK being on the red list. We seemed to be the only ones from the flight who had to do this as people from most other countries do not need the test so getting through everything did not take much longer than usual. We had a bit of a wait for our luggage but within an hour of landing, we were at the PB car hire office where we collected a pick-up truck that we will have for the next ten days.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were at Sand Dollar before 5pm and checked into a one bedroom apartment, D09, which we think is the same one we stayed in in 2015. We put our luggage in the apartment and went out about half an hour later to the supermarkets to stock up on food for the next few days. After getting back again, we unpacked and then went to Captain Don's to get take-away pizzas which we ate in the apartment. We were both totally knackered by this time having been awake for over 22 hours and not getting much sleep last night. The build up to the trip had been quite stressful with all the paperwork and uncertainty about whether or not we would get here but it was a relief to finally be here and  to start getting ready for diving again tomorrow.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 27th October</span>
            We were both awake early again but had had a good nights sleep and were feeling a lot better than when we had arrived yesterday. We had a couple of hours to sort out all of our equipment, have breakfast and get to the dive centre by the time it opened at 8:00. The dive centre all seemed a bit chaotic compared to other years. They have changed their policy of allowing you to access tanks 24 hours a day meaning there was a lot of people there to collect their tanks for the day.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			In previous years, we had been allowed to fill out the paperwork and get straight into the water with a minimum of briefing. This time the woman who checked us in insisted that we have the full orientation and that we had to wait until 9:00 as she was giving the briefing to other customers as well. In the end, she started the briefing at about 8:30 for us and one other customer. It was a complete waste of time for us but it did not go on for too long and we were able to get in the water for our first dive at Bari Reef just after 9.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did not see anything too spectacular on the first dive but it was good to be back underwater. Our regs were brand new and the rest of our equipment had not been used for almost two years so it was good to find that everything still worked.... and that we still knew how to use it all! Bari Reef was the same as when we last dived it but no turtle sightings this time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As usual here, we did not go too far on our first day and stuck to the house reefs. We did the second dive at The Cliff. This was a very good dive. We had been told about a sea-horse by divers coming out as we were going in and more by luck than judgment, managed to spot it about 20 minutes into the dive. We spent a bit of time taking photos of it in both directions and then towards the end of the dive, Roz spotted the first turtle of the trip. This was quite a sleepy green turtle who was not that bothered by us and was a good way to end the dive.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Third dive of the day was at Something Special. Again a nice enough dive without anything too spectacular. It had started raining as we were getting into the water and by the time we came out it was torrential. We had left the truck windows open as usual so the inside of the car was soaked. We stopped to collect more tanks at Yellow Sub and returned to the apartment for cups of tea to warm up. When we had landed yesterday, the heat had felt horrendous and we had eaten our pizzas in the apartment as even at 8pm, it was too hot to eat outside the air-conditioning. The difference in 24 hours was unbelievable.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After just about getting warm again, we put our wet gear back on and walked down to the entry point for Bari Reef. Although the rain had stopped by this point it was still very dark and this was just about a night dive. Another enjoyable dive although it is still slightly sad diving here at this time and not seeing any turtles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear and returned to the apartment. We had decided to have a few days of not going out so cooked pasta for tea. Tonight it was cool enough to eat on our balcony!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 28th October</span>
            A good dive to start the day. We were up at 5:15 and in the water at Bari Reef by 6:00. Still no sign of any turtles but this morning we found two frog fish. I saw the first about 10 minutes into the dive. It was probably the biggest frog fish we have ever seen in Bonaire and was bright yellow so even in the dark was quite easy to spot. We spent about 10 minutes photographing it before moving on. The rest of the dive was also very good. It is always a nice time to dive as a lot of the reef is just waking up. We turned round after about 45 minutes and went to see the frog fish again on the way back. It had moved slightly and after a few minutes of looking at it, we both noticed a second, much smaller one about 30 - 40 cm away. Plenty more photos before returning to the pier.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast in the apartment we headed to Salt Pier, our favourite site here from the last couple of trips. Within less than a minute of going down, we saw a green turtle. For the previous few trips, there have been a lot of juvenile green turtles feeding in the shallows on the way out to the pier. It was good to know that they are all still there. Roz counted five on the way out and another three on the way back in. Not as many as on some dives here but we will spend plenty more time here in the next few weeks.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had to drive back to the Delfins Dive Friends shop to replace a tank with a faulty o-ring before dive three. This was not too far out of our way as we had planned to dive from Angel City which is not far from Delfins resort. This dive did not go quite to plan. I got the bearing slightly wrong and we were pushed further off route by the current meaning that we missed the mooring buoy and joined the outer reef further North than planned. We had not realised how much out we were until the anchor chains of the Hilma Hooker appeared about five minutes after we had joined the second reef. We still crossed at that point and after swimming the length of the wreck we continued North to The Lake before turning round. Still a very nice dive despite not spending as long on the second reef as planned.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to the apartment stopping for more tanks at Port Bonaire on the way. We had a quick visit to the Chinese Supermarket before lunch on the balcony and a couple of hours of not doing a lot before the fourth dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For dive 4, we had planned to dive from The Cliff back to Bari Reef. We went in at The Cliff and started heading South. We went for another look at the sea-horse first. We found it easily again as there were already divers there taking photos when we got to it. Although it was in the same place as yesterday, both of us thought it was a different sea-horse so there may be two there. The photos do not really clear it up one way or the other so we will have to go back and look again!
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Shortly after the sea-horse, I spotted our first hawksbill turtle of the trip. It was on the steep part of The Cliff and it abruptly halted our plan to continue back to Bari Reef. Apart from a couple of trips up for air, it did not move much along the reef and kept eating from roughly the same spot. We stayed with it for about 40 minutes before it had had enough and settled down under a ledge for the night. We headed back the way we came and got back out where we had come in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed all our gear and kept it in the apartment this time as there was not much point returning it to the equipment room. Although we had planned to eat in for a few nights, Roz had spotted that Breeze and Bites was having a $10 Burger Night so we went out and ate there instead. We went out at 8 after doing log books, photos, etc. Very good meals and back in the apartment not long after 9.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 29th October</span>
            I was up at 4 for the second morning in a row in an attempt to buy tickets to see The Stereophonics next month, a successful attempt this time. After that, we were back to our usual routine of three morning dives at the Southern Bonaire sites. We got up at 6:00, loaded the truck and drove directly to The Hilma Hooker. This as always was an excellent dive when you get it to yourself and once again, this morning we had the whole wreck to ourselves for the entire dive.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			When we got back to the truck we found that it had been broken into. This is a known problem in Bonaire but it was the first time it had happened to us in our eleven trips here. We know not to leave valuables in the car and to leave it unlocked with the windows down. What was stolen - my sun-glasses, my flip-flops, my hat and two pairs of swimming shorts - had no real value but it was still an annoyance as they are all things I need and will have to be replaced. They did not take any of Roz's things!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After this discovery, we ate our breakfast and headed further South to Margate Bay. This was another very nice dive site with the added bonus of seeing three turtles - one sleepy green turtle at the start of the dive, one hawksbill that swam past us and disappeared deeper than we were going to go and another green turtle in the shallows towards the end.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Third dive was another 107 minutes at Salt Pier. Plenty more turtle activity in the shallows in both directions again and an enjoyable hour on so on the pier itself. We were back at the apartment for lunch by 2ish. After eating I had a quite successful trip to the Chinese supermarket. I managed to buy replacement sun-glasses and flip-flops and a case of Amstel Bright. There seemed to have been an island-wide shortage of Bright since we arrived but thankfully that appears to have come to an end.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We decided to try and do The Cliff to Bari Reef again tonight. We did succeed this time but it was not the greatest of dives. We started by going to see the sea-horse again. It is quite superb to watch as it moves about quite a lot. It is probably trying to get away from the cameras but it does make it quite entertaining. We were with it for about 10 minutes before moving on and trying to look for yesterdays turtle. We could not find it and by the time we had given up and started heading to Bari, we had already spent quite a bit of time underwater and used quite a bit of air. We probably should have turned round again but kept going despite the fact that we were swimming into a slight current. The current meant that it was quite a hard swim and we did not really have time to stop and look at anything on the way. I got back to Bari on about 20 Bar.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We took all the gear back to the apartment again, had showers and then I walked back to get the truck. We did log books, etc and cooked pasta which we ate on the balcony. Another early night.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 30th October</span>
            A day of local diving today as we wanted to follow the football at 10 and join the weekly video call at some point this afternoon. We were up at 5:15 but instead of our usual early morning dive on Bari Reef, we drove to The Cliff in an attempt to look for the turtle again. We had seen where it went to sleep on Thursday and assumed it would be waking up somewhere in the same area.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were in the water by 5:50. We swam to where we had seen the turtle go to sleep on Thursday but it was no-where to be seen. We had decided not to spend too much time with the sea-horse but in the absence of the turtle went to have another look at it anyway. As we were looking at the seahorse, I spotted the turtle a few metres above us. As on Thursday, it did not travel far along the reef but was content to spend a lot of time eating in the same spot. We spent a whole hour watching it eat while moving slowly South along the reef. An excellent dive to start the day and reminiscent of some of early morning dives with Turtle 1.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had breakfast on the balcony and then it was straight back into the water at Bari Reef. This was another enjoyable dive. The two frog fish were both in the same place and the smaller one was quite active for a frog fish. Roz spotted another turtle but I was further ahead of her and did not see it.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in the apartment to follow the second half of the football (with slightly different levels of enjoyment!) before going out to Buddy's for dive 3. We went North as far as the sea-horse again before turning round and heading back. Nothing too spectacular on the dive but all very nice again with plenty of fish.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Sand Dollar for lunch and joined in the J-Team video call for an hour or so. We returned to The Cliff for the evening dive. No sign of the turtle this time but another enjoyable evening dive anyway. My strobe arm broke while photographing the sea-horse, something it was probably very pleased about, but luckily this was fixed more easily than expected when we returned to the apartment.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we decided not to out to eat but did go out and get take-aways from Donor Station just over the road. Had excellent meals sat on the balcony and another early night.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 31st October</span>
            We had to fit our diving today around our "Day 5 PCR Test" that we had to go for due to the UK being on Bonaire's red list. The tests were booked for just after 10. This meant we only had one dive before going so had a bit of a later start than usual. We were still up by 6:30 and in the water at Bari Reef just after 7:00. We had planned to head South from the pier this morning but as we were getting ready to go in, we were told about another frog fish just North of the ones we had already seen. We decided to go and have a look for this first.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We found the two yellow ones again and spent about 10 - 15 minutes looking for a grey one without success. We then did head South although did not get as far as if we head gone that way from the start. A very enjoyable dive to start the day and we did get a brief sighting of the first octopus of this trip.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed off to the covid test centre at 9:45. This all went pretty smoothly and we were both tested in about 10 minutes without having to get out of the truck. It did not seem quite as thorough a test as the ones we had at Heathrow but they seemed to know what they were doing. Just have to wait 48 hours now to get our results and find out if we are allowed to continue our diving! As the centre was just South of Kralendijk, we had taken tanks with us and headed straight down to do a couple of dives at the Southern sites. We went to Vista Blue first. This site was good for turtles last year. We did not see any this time but did briefly see a small eagle ray towards the end of the dive.
        </p>

			src="images/bonaire2021/bonaire_009.jpg">
        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We then had another 100 minute dive at Salt Pier - about an hour on the pier and the rest of the time with the turtles. Very enjoyable as always. We had decided that because of the later start we would only do the three dives today. We returned to the apartment stopping for tanks at Port Bonaire on the way. We had lunch on the balcony and then had a few hours without a lot to do for the first time since we got here. Roz went to sit in the sun while I sorted out photos and videos.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got take-away pizzas from Captain Don's again in the evening and had another quiet night in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday 1st November</span>
            We were up at 5:15 again for another early morning dive at The Cliff. We did not find the turtle this morning but did confirm that there are two sea-horses there. When we got down to the coral where they live, they were within a few inches of each other. They were not in ideal places for being photographed unfortunately but at least we now know that there are definitely two there. We spent most of the dive looking for the turtle. We did see a turtle towards the end of the dive. I thought it was a hawksbill but Roz who was closer to it thought it was a green turtle.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast, we headed up to a couple of the Northern sites for the first time on this trip. We went first to 1000 Steps which was as nice as ever but we did not see any turtles. Despite the number of times we have dived here, I had to surface to find the marker buoy on the way back. The vis was not great and we must have been just about at it when we decided that we must have missed it and turned round. Still a good dive. The number of people on the beach here was incredible when we came out. We were the second car in the car park and the beach was empty when we went in but by the time we were out of the water, the beach was packed (compared to normal) and there were cars everywhere. Unfortunately, the policy of trying to attract non-diving tourists to Bonaire seems to be working.

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For our third dive, we continued North to Karpata. This is a spectacular site but can be a very difficult entry/exit if the conditions are not right. We have had a few trips up there where we have decided not to risk it and had to drive back  the long way round due to the one-way system which can be frustrating. At the moment the sea is very calm so we decided to give it a go again. Today, the conditions could not have been better and getting in was easier than we have ever seen it. Another enjoyable dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Fourth dive of the day was Bari Reef. We saw the frog fish again before heading South. There was a school of jacks just off the reef which we had not seen here before. All  quite good in the rubbley bits in the Southern parts of the site that we do not go to that often. We saw another octopus on the way back, possibly the same one that we saw a few days ago.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After washing our gear and taking it back to the apartment (we have just about given up on the equipment room - it is easier to keep everything in the apartment) we had a few drinks on the balcony while doing log books, etc. Our first alcohol since arriving in Bonaire! We ate pasta again with our drinks but were still in bed not long after 9.

            Another three dives down South today. We were up at 6. We had a bad start as when setting up our gear, one of the tanks had a faulty o-ring. This meant two trips down to the pier (I did not take my glasses the first time so could not open the combination lock on the gate to the pier!) to get a replacement tank. We were still on our way by 6:30 and in the water at Angel City just after 7:00.
        </p>

			We went out to the second reef and headed South, a dive that had been recommended to us the last time we were in Bonaire. The second reef is shallower here meaning that we could still have quite a long dive. We stayed on the second reef for about 30 - 40 minutes before crossing back and finishing the dive on the inner reef. For the second dive, we went to Tori's Reef. This was another nice enough dive without seeing anything particularly notable.

			Dive three was back at Salt Pier. Longest dive of the trip so far - 111 minutes. It was similar to our other dives here i.e. 60 minutes on the pier and the rest of the time with the turtles. We spent about five minutes with a giant green moray on the pier, the closest we have ever been to one of these. Another very good dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Back at the apartment we were relieved to find that neither of us had been contacted by the Bonaire Health Department. We had been told on Sunday that we would only be contacted if we had tested positive and if we had not heard within 48 hours then the tests were negative. This means no more tests during our stay in Bonaire!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a late lunch on the balcony before heading off for the fourth dive of the day at The Cliff. We spent a bit more time at the Northern end of the site at the start of the dive and then went back to the sea-horses. They were both there tonight but no sign of the turtle again.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a similar evening to yesterday with a few drinks on the balcony. Instead of cooking, we had take-aways from Donor Station again.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 3rd November</span>
            Three dives today (and the first day since we got here that I have managed to not have a reverse profile!). We were up at 5:15 for our early morning dive, this morning at The Cliff. We dived it slightly differently to usual but still could not find the turtle. We did see the two sea-horses again and also an eagle ray at the top of the reef at the end of the dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to the apartment for breakfast and then went back to The Cliff to collect more tanks. One of the Dive Friends staff there told us that there are in fact three sea-horses there and also that they have three resident turtles including two hawksbills. I think we could be diving here a lot in the next week or two!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once we had our tanks, we headed North again and did two more dives - one at 1000 Steps and one at Oil Slick Leap. We went South at both sites. Both dives were good without us seeing anything too spectacular. Still no turtles at 1000 Steps so a turtle free day day. We washed our gear at The Cliff, collected another tank for Friday morning and returned to the apartment for lunch.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Tomorrow will be a day off diving so we could have a few more drinks tonight. We had a couple on the balcony while doing our log books and looking at photos and then walked into Kralendijk just after 5. We stopped for a few drinks at Kanti Awa on the way. This is a small locals bar with cheap beer and is a good spot for watching the sun set. We spent an hour or so in there talking to two couples from The Netherlands and Germany who have spent the last two and a half years sailing here from Europe.

		<p class="diary-text">
			After leaving there, we headed to the Bonaire Blond Brewery, now called La Cantina Cerveceria as it no long brews its own beer. Still an excellent bar with a good range of Dutch and Belgian beers and I managed to get the t'IJ Zatte that I missed out on at Schiphol. We had a few in there before walking back to Sand Dollar. We had planned to stop at a few of the Chinese bars along the road on the way back but only one was open so we were home by 10:30. We had a few more drinks in the apartment before falling asleep.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 4th November</span>
            A lazy day without too much to do. We got up late and had breakfast on the balcony. We went into Kralendijk just after 1. We stopped for a look round the Dive Friends retail shop and then went into town to look round the souvenir shops, buy Christmas decorations and have ice-creams at Gio's. We filled up the truck with petrol and stocked up on provisions for the next week or so at the supermarkets.

			We had lunch when we got back to the apartment. I walked back to the Dive Friends shop to buy something that will let us take money/credit cards, etc underwater and a new torch as Roz's old one broke this morning (this was going to be a Christmas present but we decided that it may as well be used straight away as it is a lot better than her back-up torch). We did not do a lot else until going to watch the sun set with the iguanas at 6ish. We returned to Breeze and Bites for their Thursday Burger Night and were back in the apartment just after 8.

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 5th November</span>
            Another early start. We were up at 5:15 and were going into the water at The Cliff half an hour later. As with the last few dives here, we saw two of the sea-horses but there was no sign of the turtle. For the second dive, we went to Yellow Submarine for the first time this trip. This is always a nice enough dive without us seeing anything too spectacular. The most notable thing on the dive were the tarpon which seemed to be huge and quite active.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Dive three was on Bari Reef. We have dived here a lot in the early morning and the evening but not usually at this sort of time. Another nice dive. We saw the two frog fish again and had the bonus of a large hawksbill towards the end of the dive. It was in about 8m of water just to the South of the entry point. I was already on less than 50 bar when we saw it so shared Roz's air so we could spend ten minutes or so with it before ending the dive.

			We had lunch on the balcony and then went to sort out our hire cars. We have always used PB Car Hire when on Bonaire but we had booked late this time and they did not have a truck available for the whole of our stay. We had booked one with Bonaire Rent A car for the remainder of our stay. We put all our dive gear in the truck we had and drove to the Bonaire Rent A Car Office. We transferred all our gear to the new truck and drove the old one back to the airport. Someone from Bonaire Rent A Car drove the new truck to pick us up and returned to the office to sort out all the paperwork. Although this was hassle we could have done without, the whole thing only took about 40 minutes and the new truck is better for us than the previous one. The first car was an "upgrade" on what we had actually ordered but not a very good upgrade for us. It was a bigger truck which meant that it was more difficult, particularly for Roz, to dive from. The new one is smaller and older with a missing tailgate but is ideal.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As we were already just South of Kralendijk, we went back to Salt Pier for our fourth dive. We have never dived it at this time of day but it was as enjoyable as ever. There were probably fewer turtles around in the shallows but we still had plenty of time with the ones that were there. Apart from a particularly gormless group of divers on the pier it was also as good as usual. We had the bonus of finding another frog fish under the centre structure. All in all a very good dive again.

            Just three dives today as we wanted to start drinking with the J-Team video call by 4pm. We already had our tanks so headed South again by 6:30. First dive was Angel City to Hilmer Hooker again. We got the navigation right today which meant that we had more time on the outer reef than we had when we did the dive last week. Our navigation was not so good on the second dive at Sweet Dreams! The current was stronger on the way back than I had realised and we went past the entry point without noticing. Not the best dive of the trip but we did see a green turtle at the start of it.

		 Third dive at Salt Pier was excellent again. There were a lot of turtles around, particularly on the way back. There seemed to be a lot going on at the pier with an octopus on the way out, lots of tarpon, barracuda and we saw the giant green moray again. The frog fish had moved and was harder to find than yesterday but we did find manage to find it. After the dive, we washed our gear at Port Bonaire and were back at Sand Dollar just before 3:00.

			We had lunch on the balcony and then joined the video call for an hour and a half. We headed into Kralendijk just after 5 and had a very similar evening to the one we had on Wednesday. We stopped at Kanti Awa for a few drinks while watching the sunset (just a cat to talk to tonight) and then walked to the brewery. We managed to get a table outside at the front this time and had a very enjoyable few hours drinking Gulpener Ur-Hop IPA which was very good and on special offer at $3.25 a bottle. We stopped at a couple of the Chinese bars on the way back. These are pretty crap really but they do break up the walk home a bit. We were back in the apartment just before 11 although getting back is a bit of a vague memory.

            Another day of not doing a lot. We had a late breakfast of scrambled eggs on the balcony. Roz spent an hour or so in the sun while I sorted out photos and videos from the last few days. We went out briefly to The Chinese supermarket but did not do anything else until 4pm when we walked to Captain Don's for pizzas.

            All our diving was fairly local today. We did the early morning dive at Bari Reef. We had been going in the  water before 6:00 as this use to mean that we would see Turtle 1 waking up. As we have not been seeing turtles at this time, we had a slightly later start this morning and went in at 6:15. We went South from the entry point this time. We got as  far as the small wreck before turning back. We did go back to have a look at the frog fish before the end of the dive but only the smaller one was there. No sign of the larger female.

			After breakfast on the balcony, we went to The Cliff for dive two. We saw two of the sea-horses and also a couple of turtles. We saw a large hawksbill at the start of the dive. Unfortunately, it went deeper before heading out into the blue so we could not spend too much time with it. We also saw another green turtle North of the entry point.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did Bari Reef again for our third dive, this time heading North. Roz managed to spot the missing frog fish a couple of minutes before we got to the place where we had seen it before. The other one was in its usual spot. We saw the school of jacks that we had seen last week again and it appeared to have increased in size. No sign of any turtles this time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to The Cliff for dive four. The current had been going South all day so we planned to dive all the way back to Bari Reef. As it was, what little current there was was going North and the plan got knocked on the head anyway when I spotted a green turtle just after the sea-horses. We had a few minutes in the shallows with the turtle and continued South for another 5 - 10 minutes before turning round. We kept going North of the entry point and saw another couple of green turtles swimming around together in the shallows. We watched them until they swam out into the blue and then ended the dive.

			We washed our gear at The Cliff and then returned to Sand Dollar for an evening in with a few beers and more pasta.

            Three dives down South again today. We were on our way by 6:30 and headed first for Angel City. As we arrived at the site, we noticed there was a ship docked at Salt Pier meaning that we would not be able to dive there. Ships come in fairly regularly to load up with salt and the pier is closed to divers for a few days while they are there. There was a reasonable chance it would happen sometime during our three week stay but a shame nevertheless.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			The dive at Angel City was very good again. We spent longer on the outer reef, going South and then coming back along the top of it before crossing back. It is an excellent time to be out there with a lot of fish, nice light as the sun comes up and, as usual, no other divers.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For dive two, we went to Red Beryl, a site we have only dived once before and not for a long time. This was another good dive with a very nice reef on our way North and three green turtle encounters on the way back. The green turtles seemed huge here after spending so much time with the juveniles at Salt Pier.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As we could not go in at Salt Pier, we went in at Jeannie's Glory, the next site up. We swam South in the shallows to see if there would be any turtles as it is not far from the area we always see them in. We did not see any initially but after we had turned round and gone a bit deeper, we did see another three. We continued out to the reef which was very nice and a lot more interesting than some of the Southern sites.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed back to Sand Dollar via Port Bonaire for more tanks and The Warehouse to buy things for lunch and another box of Amstel Bright. By the time we had had lunch, we only had an hour or so before heading out for our fourth dive of the day. We decided to try The Cliff to Bari Reef again and this time made it all the way.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We started off going for a look at the sea-horses. We probably shouldn't bother with this when we are planning to go all the way to Bari as they are at 16 - 18m and by the time we have found them and taken a few pictures, I have used quite a bit of my air. However, it is just about impossible to just swim past them so we went for another look. At the start of the dive we were going into slight current and had thought about changing the plan again but a few minutes after the sea-horses, the current changed direction and we decided to keep going.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The dive was fairly uneventful until we were back on Bari Reef. Around the spot where we used to see the turtles a lot at about 7m, I saw a yellow frog fish that looked a different size to the ones we had been seeing. Unfortunately it was moving and went under a rock fairly quickly so we could not get photos. I was getting fairly low on air by this time but we continued on to check that the other two frog fish were still there and that there were actually three around.

		<p class="diary-text">
			They were both still there but whereas in the last couple of weeks they have been about 1m or so apart, tonight they moved perfectly next to each other - an ideal photo opportunity! After spending a few minutes getting our photos it was a dash back to the pier where I arrived with about 20 bar.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After washing the gear and having showers, we had a few drinks on the balcony while doing log books and looking at the days photos. We went out to eat at Captain Don's. In the past, it used to be quite empty by 8:30ish. We are not sure why there are so many people there but at the moment, it is still very busy at that time. We had to wait about an hour to get our pizzas which were very good again when they arrived. One more drink when we got back and in bed by about 10:30.

            We were in the water at Bari Reef by 6:20. We wanted to go and see all the frog fish, particularly the one we had only seen briefly last night. We found the first two relatively easily. They were in the same area that we usually find them in and had returned to being about 1m apart again. The new one took a bit more finding but we did spot him eventually and were able to get pictures of him this time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast, as the ship is still at Salt Pier, we headed North and did two dives at 1000 Steps with our surface interval on the beach. Both dives were good again, particularly the second one when we did the Northern section of the site where the coral is more spectacular. Still no turtles. You used to be able to just about guarantee seeing them here but we did not see many here on our last trip to Bonaire and have now not seen any on four dives here this time.

			We returned to the apartment, had left-over pizza for lunch and then had an hour or so before heading off to The Cliff for the fourth dive of the day. We started off heading North in the shallows and found a green turtle there quite early in the dive. We then turned South and went down to the sea-horses. We could only find one this time but did not spend too much time looking for the other one. There were quite a few other divers trying to find them so we left them to it and continued South for another 10 minutes or so. We continued looking for more turtles for a while without success. We were both starting to get very cold by the end of this dive and ended it after 84 minutes.
        </p>

			We ate in again tonight so had a few drinks while doing log books and then cooked pasta. In bed by 9:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 11th November</span>
            We started the day with another excellent early morning dive on Bari Reef. We were in just after 6:00 and after dropping down to 20m, we headed directly to the frog fish area. The small one was in his usual place but we could not see the female. We found her a few metres along the reef and she was heading North at quite a rate (for a frog fish). We stayed with her for 20 minutes or so watching her "swim" along the reef. Once she had settled down on a piece of coral for a few minutes, we continued North to look for the third one. He was also relatively active so we had about 10 minutes watching him moving around the reef as well.

		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed back towards the pier and as we were getting close, Roz spotted the hawksbill that we have now seen here three times. Unfortunately, each time we have seen it, I have been on 40 bar so we could not stay with it for as long as we would have liked but we still had a few minutes with it before we ended the dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For the next two dives we headed South stopping at the Dive Friends retail shop on the way. We picked up tanks and I bought a Lavacore top as I had been cold on this mornings dive as well as on last nights. We did dive two at Aquarius which has easy entry/exit. We could not see the outer reef here so stayed on the inner reef for the whole dive. Nice enough without being too exciting. We were still not able to dive Salt Pier so did our third dive at Jeannie's Glory again. We spent quite a bit of time looking for the turtles but only found one this time. We spent about 20 minutes with it before heading out to the reef. We had about 50 minutes on the reef before heading back in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Sand Dollar for lunch collecting more tanks from Port Bonaire on the way. Just after 4pm, we were notified that Densa Seal had left Salt Pier. It had looked as if loading had been completed when we came out of the water at Jeannie's Glory but I received an email from marineshipping.com confirming that the ship had departed from the pier at 16:10. This means that we should be able to dive Salt Pier as often as we want for the rest of our stay.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were planning on doing Something Special for dive four but I could not really be bothered to go anywhere so we decided to do Bari Reef again. This turned out to be a good move as the dive was just about as good as the one here this morning. It was in fact very similar to this mornings dive. We found the smaller of the two frog fish in his usual spot. The female was on her way back and was only a few metres away. Frog fish 3 was quite active again making his way back to the spot where we first found him a few nights ago. By the time we were back at the pair of frog fish, they were within a few cm of each other again.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We then found the same hawksbill as this morning again. This time I had 70 bar left so we could spend a bit more time with it as she (?) tried to find somewhere to go to sleep for the night. A really good end to the dive. Bari Reef back to its best!

			We had booked a table at Breeze and Bites for 8pm as it is burger night again. We had been told that they were busy but could fit us in. When we got there we were given a good table but had not even been given drinks after about 15 minutes so we got up and left. We tried to book a table at Eddy's for tomorrow on our way back to the room, but they were full and seemed reluctant to let us have a table tonight despite being less than half full. We gave up and had pasta back in the apartment and then watched all our videos from the last few days.

            Another good days diving with turtles on every dive. We started with an early morning dive on Bari Reef. Having seen where the hawksbill was going to sleep last night, we headed straight for that area. We found here within a few minutes still asleep under a ledge with half of her shell sticking out. She woke within a few minutes of us getting to her just as it was starting to get light and we were able to spend 80 minutes watching her on the reef. She does not seem to move about as much as some turtles we have seen and stayed in the same area the whole time only going up for air a couple of times. It really was like the good old days of watching Turtle 1. We left her when I was low on air and we briefly saw a green turtle just as we were heading back to the pier.

		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast, we headed South again. We did the second dive from Angel City to Hilma Hooker. We went out to the second reef and went South for ten minutes before turning North and continuing all the way back to the anchor chains and crossing to the wreck. A boat had just dropped off as we were heading out which meant that there were quite a few other divers out there this time which is unusual for the outer reef. We were swimming into current which made it hard work but I still had enough air to swim the length of the wreck and get back to the mooring line before I was down to 50 bar.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Third dive was to be at Salt Pier. When we arrived there, although the ship had left there were signs up saying that maintenance work was taking place and we were still not allowed to dive there. We asked one of the workman when it was due to reopen for diving and were told 2pm. We decided that we would come back so went down and dived at Margate Bay while we waited. This was another nice dive with another two green turtles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had to go back to get more tanks from Delfins resort before heading back to the pier where we were in the water just before 2. The conditions were worse today than they have been and a lot of sand was being churned up making it harder to get in and out of the water and also making turtle spotting more difficult than usual. We still saw three on our way out to the pier and three more (or the same three?) on the way back. The pier was as good as ever and the frog fish was still in roughly the same place. There were more divers there than we have ever seen here before. A lot of other people will have been waiting all week to dive it and for anyone going home at the weekend, this could be their only chance. It was good to be back here anyway after six days!

			We rinsed our gear and collected more tanks at Port Bonaire and were back in the apartment by 4:30 in time for the second half of the England v Albania game. We watched it on my tablet although it struggled to hold our interest much as we were 5 - 0 up by half time. It was a normal sort of evening in. We had a few drinks with log books and photos on the balcony. As our planned meal at Eddy's had been knocked on the head, Roz went and got kebabs from Donor Station again. We ate on the balcony and then had one more drink while watching todays videos.

            Another excellent early morning dive on Bari Reef to start the day. We could not find the turtle initially so went to look at the frog fish. They were all in their usual places but were not quite as active this morning. After a few photos of all of them, we continued our search for the turtle and found her again near the entry point. Although we did not find her until about 80 minutes into the dive, she did not move much and stayed shallow so we were able to stay with her for about 35 - 40 minutes before having to end the dive. This ended up being our longest dive to date at 126 minutes.

			After breakfast, we headed South again. Dive two was at Angel City where again, we spent a lot of time on the outer reef. It was superb out there again with the spectacular coral, big schools of fish and no other divers this time. Third dive was at Salt Pier. Not so many turtles today - only one in each direction - and we could not find the frog fish but still an excellent dive. There is so much going on around the pier and we had the bonus of squid and an eagle ray for a few minutes as we were heading back into the shallows.

			We stopped at Port Bonaire for more tanks and had our final trip to The Warehouse for provisions on the way back. After lunch, we joined the video call for an hour before going back to Bari Reef for our fourth dive of the day. Another very good dive with all the frog fish in their usual places and another 20 minutes or so with the turtle. Towards the end of the dive, we were both getting cold and tired. Every time we come to Bonaire we say we are going to dive less as it wears us out. Once again on this trip we will have done more dives than ever with our longest ever average dive time.... and it is starting to take its toll, particularly as we are sticking to four dives a day. Almost seven hours underwater today.  Only two more days to go!
        </p>

			After washing our gear, instead of doing log books, we rejoined the video call for another hour or so, this time with a few drinks. We went to Captain Don's again to eat at 8:30ish. We had planned to order from their main menu but the place was very busy again and we were behind a few groups including one of 20 people. We realised it would take a while to get food so we quickly ordered pizzas, and had a couple of drinks in the bar while we waited for a table. We got shown to the table reasonably quickly and did not have to wait too long for the pizzas so it did not work out too badly.
        </p>

			We had one more drink when we got back and got to bed just before 11. A very late night!

            We were up at 5:30 for another early morning dive on Bari Reef. There was quite a strong current coming from the North this morning. We had a quick look for the turtle before going to look at the frog fish which were very close together again. We had planned to not go to the third frog fish and the current would have made it hard work to get there anyway. Instead we turned round and went to look at the area where we keep seeing the turtle. No sign of her this morning.

			We went down South for dive two at Salt Pier. The conditions are slowly getting better making turtle spotting a bit easier again. We found two as soon as we went down and stayed with them for 20 minutes before proceeding to the pier. Pier was as good as always but we still could not find the frog fish. He seems to have left the area. Six more turtles on the way back in so another very good dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For dive three, we went back to The Cliff for a last look at the sea-horses. There was only one there today and my camera battery was flat for some reason so I could not get any last pictures of it (I probably do have more than enough of them by now anyway!) We did see three green turtles, one of which we were with for about ten minutes and almost swam into my mask at one point so another very enjoyable dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had lunch on the balcony and then Roz booked our flights to come back here in March. We have thoroughly enjoyed the diving here. We want another diving holiday before too long and with S. E. Asia still looking a bit uncertain with covid restrictions, coming back here again seemed like a good idea. We still had credits with KLM from the canceling and re-booking of this trip so used those while the prices are still low.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			 Dive four was back at Bari Reef. Similar to this morning except we did make it to the third frog fish this time. We did not see the turtle again but it was another very good dive. The pair of frog fish were very close together again. There is a huge amount of activity on the reef at that time and tonight for the second night running there were large numbers of creole wrasse swimming along the reef - something we used to see every day in Bonaire but have not seen so much of recently.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a few drinks while doing log books and looking at photos on the balcony again but decided to have another night in after the late night yesterday. In bed by our more usual time of 9:30

            Our last day of diving for this trip so we were repeating our favourite dive sites. We started the day on Bari Reef in the hope that we would find the hawksbill again. There was quite strong current again and we had a very similar dive to the one yesterday morning. We saw the two frog fish and spent a while looking for the turtle without success. We did have a few minutes looking at an octopus towards the end of the dive. We have not seen many on this trip so far and this is the first one that we have seen that has not been hidden in a hole.

			After breakfast, we headed back to Angel City. We have really enjoyed diving here recently in both directions. Today we went South and spent about 40 - 50 minutes on the outer reef. All very nice again. Dive three was a final visit to Salt Pier. We found turtles as soon as we went in the water, three in total on the way out. We spent an hour or so on the pier and saw another two octopus including another that was out on the reef. We headed back in for a final look at the turtles and initially struggled to find any. We did eventually find one which swam away from us quite quickly and then Roz found another two octopus. Suddenly they are everywhere! We spent a few minutes chasing one of them with our cameras, and then found one last turtle to look at before exiting.

			The last dive of the trip was on Bari Reef again. We went in earlier than usual just before 3pm. The current had increased in strength from this morning and was probably stronger than we have seen it in over 100 dives at this site. We were able to have a last look at the two frog fish that have been here for our whole stay and did manage to get to the area where the third one lives but could not find it. The conditions made looking for anything just about impossible. We drifted back to South of the entry point looking for the turtle but could not go too far as it would have been hard work to get back. Gave up after 73 minutes and ended the dive. An enjoyable enough dive although probably not the one we would have chosen as our final dive!
        </p>

			We spent an hour or so washing all our gear and started drinking while watching the sunset at 6ish. We had a few more drinks while doing log books, etc and went out to Captain Don's. As we were drinking, we were prepared to wait for slow service but tonight, we were shown straight to a table, had drinks orders taken immediately and were served our pizzas within about 15 minutes. A few cocktails and a couple of drinks when we got back completed a very enjoyable last evening.

            We were both up by about 9 and after breakfast had a few things to sort out. We returned our weight belts and paid our bill at Dive Friends then went to try and book our accommodation here for March. We were hoping to book the same apartment again but it is not available and they had no one-bedroom apartments for most of the time we want to come. We could have booked a studio apartment but these are not as nice and certainly not as good value. We had a few options and eventually booked a one bedroom apartment for the first nine days of our stay and an apartment at Den Laman next door for the remainder of our stay.

			We filled out our passenger location forms for getting back into England. We were supposed to have booked a PCR test for two days after we get back but used the number from the ones we booked when we returned from Germany in September. This appeared to have worked and we were able to download the forms.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Apart from a walk to the souvenir shop at Captain Don's we did not do a lot for the rest of the day. We gradually packed all our gear as it dried, cooked the remainder of our food for lunch and generally lazed around the apartment and sat in the sun for the rest of the afternoon.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left the apartment at 6:30, filled up the truck with petrol and returned it to the hire car office. After sorting out the paperwork, we were driven to the airport. There were no queues at all at the KLM check-in desks when we arrived at 7, three hours before our flight was due to leave. We were asked for our proof vaccination but no-one was interested in the forms that we downloaded this morning.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a final beer in the bar before heading through immigration and waiting for an hour or so in the departure area. We boarded on time at about 9:30 but then had a delay as there was a problem loading the luggage. Eventually took off just after 11, an hour late. Had a few bottles of wine before getting a couple of hours sleep.

            We landed in Schiphol at about 1pm local time. After getting through security, we went to McDonalds for lunch and made our way to the gate for our connecting flight to LHR. Here we did get our passenger locator forms checked but got through without any problems.
