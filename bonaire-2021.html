            This was a trip to Bonaire that had been booked in December 2019. It was initially booked for September last year and has had to be moved at least twice. It has been a long wait and we have now gone almost two years without diving but it looked as if we were finally able to go. The UK is still on Bonaire's "Red List" so as well as all the pre-departure paperwork and certificates that we needed to complete, we were required to get a PCR test in the 48 hours before departure. We just about had to get this done at Heathrow so left home a day early and booked a night at the Heathrow Ibis.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left Kingsclere at 2pm and were at the Ibis by 3. Straight after checking in, we walked out to the Radison Blu Hotel about half a mile back along the A4 where there is a Randox testing centre in the car park. It took about 5 minutes to get tested and we were told that we would have the results by midnight. We both needed to test negative to be able to fly tomorrow morning. We walked back to the Ibis, had our free drink in the bar and headed out for the evening.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided to go out in Richmond. This involved getting a bus to Feltham and then a ten minute train journey to Richmond. We had five Cask Marque pubs that we wanted to visit. The first, One Kew Street, only had Doombar so we did not stay. The Railway was a Nicholson's Pub which was better. We had one in there before walking to The Duke's Head, probably the best pub of the evening. While we were in here, we both received an e-mail saying that we had tested negative. The e-mail contained our test certificate, the final piece of paperwork that we required to be allowed to fly and meant in theory that there was nothing now that could stop us getting to Bonaire. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had one in the Victoria before stopping for a free cocktail at The Pitcher and Piano. We had one in The Cricketers to complete our Cask Marque pub crawl and then stopped for another in The Tap Tavern. This had sounded quite a good pub and was alright but did not have a great selection of beers. We walked back to the station and got the train back to Feltham where we had one in the Wetherspoons before getting the bus to the hotel. We had sandwiches and a glass of wine in the room before getting to bed by about 10:30
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 26th October</span>
            We were both awake by 4:15 so had time for quick showers before checking out and driving the short distance to Terminal 3. We left the car with the Meet and Greet service in the Short Stay car park and walked into the terminal to check in. Check-in took slightly longer than usual as all our paperwork had to be checked but there were no queues and it all went relatively smoothly. Getting through security was very quick and by about 5:45 we were at the gate with our breakfast. The flight left slightly before the scheduled 6:30 departure time and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a wait of about three hours before our 11:50 flight to Bonaire. We resisted the temptation to go directly to the bar and sat around for an hour or so taking it in turns to go and look around the airport. At 10, we did return to our usual bar (Taste of the Lowlands) for the traditional pre-flight beer. The beer from the t'IJ brewery that we usually have had been removed from the menu but it had been replaced with beers from a couple of other Dutch breweries so not the end of the world. We just had the one drink before making our way to the gate about an hour before departure.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			The flight was almost totally full so took a while to load meaning that we took off slightly late but other than that, once again, everything went reasonably smoothly. Apart from having to wear masks all the time it was not really any different to any other flight. The service was a bit slow to start but once we had eaten and everything had been cleared away, things improved and we were able to get a few bottles of wine. We had to stop drinking earlier than usual as the flight was going directly to Bonaire instead of going via Aruba but it was an enjoyable few hours anyway.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We landed in Bonaire slightly early at 3:25pm. Before going through immigration, we had all our paperwork checked again and had to book another PCR test for day 5 of our stay, again due to The UK being on the red list. We seemed to be the only ones from the flight who had to do this as people from most other countries do not need the test so getting through everything did not take much longer than usual. We had a bit of a wait for our luggage but within an hour of landing, we were at the PB car hire office where we collected a pick-up truck that we will have for the next ten days.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were at Sand Dollar before 5pm and checked into a one bedroom apartment, D09, which we think is the same one we stayed in in 2015. We put our luggage in the apartment and went out about half an hour later to the supermarkets to stock up on food for the next few days. After getting back again, we unpacked and then went to Captain Don's to get take-away pizzas which we ate in the apartment. We were both totally knackered by this time having been awake for over 22 hours and not getting much sleep last night. The build up to the trip had been quite stressful with all the paperwork and uncertainty about whether or not we would get here but it was a relief to finally be here and  to start getting ready for diving again tomorrow.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 27th October</span>
            We were both awake early again but had had a good nights sleep and were feeling a lot better than when we had arrived yesterday. We had a couple of hours to sort out all of our equipment, have breakfast and get to the dive centre by the time it opened at 8:00. The dive centre all seemed a bit chaotic compared to other years. They have changed their policy of allowing you to access tanks 24 hours a day meaning there was a lot of people there to collect their tanks for the day.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			In previous years, we had been allowed to fill out the paperwork and get straight into the water with a minimum of briefing. This time the woman who checked us in insisted that we have the full orientation and that we had to wait until 9:00 as she was giving the briefing to other customers as well. In the end, she started the briefing at about 8:30 for us and one other customer. It was a complete waste of time for us but it did not go on for too long and we were able to get in the water for our first dive at Bari Reef just after 9.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did not see anything too spectacular on the first dive but it was good to be back underwater. Our regs were brand new and the rest of our equipment had not been used for almost two years so it was good to find that everything still worked.... and that we still knew how to use it! Bari Reef was the same as when we last dived it but no turtle sightings this time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As usual here, we did not go too far on our first day and stuck to the house reefs. We did the second dive at The Cliff. This was a very good dive. We had been told about a sea-horse by divers coming out as we were going in and more by luck than judgment, managed to spot it about 20 minutes into the dive. We spent a bit of time taking photos of it in both directions and then towards the end of the dive, Roz spotted the first turtle of the trip. This was quite a sleepy green turtle who was not that bothered by us and was a good way to end the dive.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Third dive of the day was at Something Special. Again a nice enough dive without anything too spectacular. It had started raining as we were getting into the water and by the time we came out it was torrential. We had left the truck windows open as usual so the inside of the car was soaked. We stopped to collect more tanks at Yellow Sub and returned to the apartment for cups of tea to warm up. When we had landed yesterday, the heat had felt horrendous and we had eaten our pizzas in the apartment as even at 8pm, it was too hot to eat outside the air-conditioning. The difference in 24 hours was unbelievable.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After just about getting warm again, we put our wet gear back on and walked down to the entry point for Bari Reef. Although the rain had stopped by this point it was still very dark and this was just about a night dive. Another enjoyable dive although it is still slightly sad diving here at this time and not seeing any turtles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear and returned to the apartment. We had decided to have a few days of not going out so cooked pasta for tea. Tonight it was cool enough to eat on our balcony!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 28th October</span>
            A good dive to start the day. We were up at 5:15 and in the water at Bari Reef by 6:00. Still no sign of any turtles but this morning we found two frog fish. I saw the first about 10 minutes into the dive. It was probably the biggest frog fish we have ever seen in Bonaire and was bright yellow so even in the dark was quite easy to spot. We spent about 10 minutes photographing it before moving on. The rest of the dive was also very good. IT is always a nice time to dive as a lot of the reef is just waking up. We turned round after about 45 minutes and went to see the frog fish again on the way back. It had moved slightly and after a few minutes of looking at it, we both noticed a second, much smaller one about 30 - 40 cm away. Plenty more photos before returning to the pier.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After breakfast in the apartment we headed to Salt Pier, our favourite site here from the last couple of trips. Within less than a minute of going down, we saw a green turtle. For the previous few trips, there have been a lot of juvenile green turtles feeding in the shallows on the way out to the pier. It was good to know that they are all still there. Roz counted five on the way out and another three on the way back in. Not as many as on some dives here but we will spend plenty more time here in the next few weeks.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had to drive back to the Delfins Dive Friends shop to replace a tank with a faulty o-ring before dive three. This was not too far out of our way as we had planned to dive from Angel City which is not far from Delfins resort. This dive did not go quite to plan. I got the bearing slightly wrong and we were pushed further off route by the current meaning that we missed the mooring buoy and joined the outer reef further North than planned. We had not realised how much out we were until the anchor chains of the Hilma Hooker appeared about five minutes after we had joined the second reef. We still crossed at that point and after swimming the length of the wreck we continued North to The Lake before turning round. Still a very nice dive despite not spending as long on the second reef as planned.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to the apartment stopping for more tanks at Port Bonaire on the way. We had a quick visit to the Chinese Supermarket before lunch on the balcony and a couple of hours of not doing a lot before the fourth dive.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			For dive 4, we had planned to dive from The Cliff back to Bari Reef. We went in at The Cliff and started heading South. We went for another look at the sea-horse first. We found it easily again as there were already divers there taking photos when we got to it. Although it was in the same place as yesterday, both of us thought it was a different sea-horse so there may be two there. The photos do not really clear it up one way or the other so we will have to go back and look again!
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Shortly after the sea-horse, I spotted our first hawksbill turtle of the trip. It was on the steep part of The Cliff and it abruptly halted our plan to continue back to Bari Reef. Apart from a couple of trips up for air, it did not move much along the reef and kept eating from roughly the same spot. We stayed with it for about 40 minutes before it had had enough and settled down under a ledge for the night. We headed back the way we came and got back out where we had come in.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed all our gear and kept it in the apartment this time as there was not much point returning it to the equipment room. Although we had planned to eat in for a few nights, Roz had spotted that Breeze and Bites was having a $10 Burger Night so we went out and ate there instead. We went out at 8 after doing log books, photos, etc. Very good meals and back in the apartment not long after 9.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Friday 29th October</span>
            I was up at 4 for the second morning in a row in an attempt to buy tickets to see The Stereophonics next month, a successful attempt this time. After that, we were back to our usual routine of three morning dives at the Southern Bonaire sites. We got up at 6:00, loaded the truck and drove directly to The Hilma Hooker. This as always was an excellent dive when you get it to yourself and once again, this morning we had the whole wreck to ourselves for the entire dive.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			When we got back to the truck we found that it had been broken into. This is a known problem in Bonaire but it was the first time it had happened to us in our eleven trips here. We know not to leave valuables in the car and to leave it unlocked with the windows down. What was stolen - my sun-glasses, my flip-flops, my hat and two pairs of swimming shorts - had no real value but it was still an annoyance as they are all things I need and will have to be replaced. They did not take any of Roz's things!
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After this discovery, we ate our breakfast and headed further South to Margate Bay. This was another very nice dive site with the added bonus of seeing three turtles - one sleepy green turtle at the start of the dive, one hawksbill that swam past us and disappeared deeper than we were going to go and another green turtle in the shallows towards the end.
        </p>
		<div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Third dive was another 107 minutes at Salt Pier. Plenty more turtle activity in the shallows in both directions again and an enjoyable hour on so on the pier itself. We were back at the apartment for lunch by 2ish. After eating I had a quite successful trip to the Chinese supermarket. I managed to buy replacement sun-glasses and flip-flops and a case of Amstel Bright. There seemed to have been an island-wide shortage of Bright since we arrived but thankfully that appears to have come to an end.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We decided to try and do The Cliff to Bari Reef again tonight. We did succeed this time but it was not the greatest of dives. We started by going to see the sea-horse again. It is quite superb to watch as it moves about quite a lot. It is probably trying to get away from the cameras but it does make it quite entertaining. We were with it for about 10 minutes before moving on and trying to look for yesterdays turtle. We could not find it and by the time we had given up and started heading to Bari, we had already spent quite a bit of time underwater and used quite a bit of air. We probably should have turned round again but kept going despite the fact that we were swimming into a slight current. The current meant that it was quite a hard swim and we did not really have time to stop and look at anything on the way. I got back to Bari on about 20 Bar.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We took all the gear back to the apartment again, had showers and then I walked back to get the truck. We did log books, etc and cooked pasta which we ate on the balcony. Another early night.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 30th October</span>
            A day of local diving today as we wanted to follow the football at 10 and join the weekly video call at some point this afternoon. We were up at 5:15 but instead of our usual early morning dive on Bari Reef, we drove to The Cliff in an attempt to look for the turtle again. We had seen where it went to sleep on Thursday and assumed it would be waking up somewhere in the same area.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were in the water by 5:50. We swam to where we had seen the turtle go to sleep on Thursday but it was no-where to be seen. We had decided not to spend too much time with the sea-horse but in the absence of the turtle went to have another look at it anyway. As we were looking at the seahorse, I spotted the turtle a few metres above us. As on Thursday, it did not travel far along the reef but was content to spend a lot of time eating in the same spot. We spent a whole hour watching it eat while moving slowly South along the reef. An excellent dive to start the day and reminiscent of some of early morning dives with Turtle 1.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had breakfast on the balcony and then it was straight back into the water at Bari Reef. This was another enjoyable dive. The two frog fish were both in the same place and the smaller one was quite active for a frog fish. Roz spotted another turtle but I was further ahead of her and did not see it.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were back in the apartment to follow the second half of the football (with slightly different levels of enjoyment!) before going out to Buddy's for dive 3. We went North as far as the sea-horse again before turning round and heading back. Nothing too spectacular on the dive but all very nice again with plenty of fish.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We returned to Sand Dollar for lunch and joined in the J-Team video call for an hour or so. We returned to The Cliff for the evening dive. No sign of the turtle this time but another enjoyable evening dive anyway. My strobe arm broke while photographing the sea-horse, something it was probably very pleased about, but luckily this was fixed more easily than expected when we returned to the apartment.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Once again, we decided not to out to eat but did go out and get take-aways from Donor Station just over the road. Had excellent meals sat on the balcony and another early night.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 31st October</span>
            We had to fit our diving today around our "Day 5 PCR Test" that we had to go for due to the UK being on Bonaire's red list. The tests were booked for just after 10. This meant we only had one dive before going so had a bit of a later start than usual. We were still up by 6:30 and in the water at Bari Reef just after 7:00. We had planned to head So
			uth from the pier this morning but as we were getting ready to go in, we were told about another frog fish just North of the ones we had already seen. We decided to go and have a look for this first.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We found the two yellow ones again and spent about 10 - 15 minutes looking for a grey one without success. We then did head South although did not get as far as if we head gone that way from the start. A very enjoyable dive to start the day and we did get a brief sighting of the first octopus of this trip.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We headed off to the covid test centre at 9:45. This all went pretty smoothly and we were both tested in about 10 minutes without having to get out of the truck. It did not seem quite as thorough a test as the ones we had at Heathrow but they seemed to know what they were doing. Just have to wait 48 hours now to get our results and find out if we are allowed to continue our diving! As the centre was just South of Kralendijk, we had taken tanks with us and headed straight down to do a couple of dives at the Southern sites. We went to Vista Blue first. This site was good for turtles last year. We did not see any this time but did briefly see a small eagle ray towards the end of the dive.
        </p>

        </div>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We then had another 100 minute dive at Salt Pier - about an hour on the pier and the rest of the time with the turtles. Very enjoyable as always. We had decided that because of the later start we would only do the three dives today. We returned to the apartment stopping for tanks at Port Bonaire on the way. We had lunch on the balcony and then had a few hours without a lot to do for the first time since we got here. Roz went to sit in the sun while I sorted out photos and videos.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got take-away pizzas from Captain Don's again in the evening and had another quiet night in.
