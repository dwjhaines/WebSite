            This was a trip to Bonaire that had been booked in December 2019. It was initially booked for September last year and has had to be moved at least twice. It has been a long wait and we have now gone almost two years without diving but it looked as if we were finally able to go. The UK is still on Bonaire's "Red List" so as well as all the pre-departure paperwork and certificates that we needed to complete, we were required to get a PCR test in the 48 hours before departure. We just about had to get this done at Heathrow so left home a day early and booked a night at the Heathrow Ibis.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We left Kingsclere at 2pm and were at the Ibis by 3. Straight after checking in, we walked out to the Radison Blu Hotel about half a mile back along the A4 where there is a Randox testing centre in the car park. It took about 5 minutes to get tested and we were told that we would have the results by midnight. We both needed to test negative to be able to fly tomorrow morning. We walked back to the Ibis, had our free drink in the bar and headed out for the evening.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had decided to go out in Richmond. This involved getting a bus to Feltham and then a ten minute train journey to Richmond. We had five Cask Marque pubs that we wanted to visit. The first, One Kew Street, only had Doombar so we did not stay. The Railway was a Nicholson's Pub which was better. We had one in there before walking to The Duke's Head, probably the best pub of the evening. While we were in here, we both received an e-mail saying that we had tested negative. The e-mail contained our test certificate, the final piece of paperwork that we required to be allowed to fly and meant in theory that there was nothing now that could stop us getting to Bonaire. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had one in the Victoria before stopping for a free cocktail at The Pitcher and Piano. We had one in The Cricketers to complete our Cask Marque pub crawl and then stopped for another in The Tap Tavern. This had sounded quite a good pub and was alright but did not have a great selection of beers. We walked back to the station and got the train back to Feltham where we had one in the Wetherspoons before getting the bus to the hotel. We had sandwiches and a glass of wine in the room before getting to bed by about 10:30
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 26th October</span>
            We were both awake by 4:15 so had time for quick showers before checking out and driving the short distance to Terminal 3. We left the car with the Meet and Greet service in the Short Stay car park and walked into the terminal to check in. Check-in took slightly longer than usual as all our paperwork had to be checked but there were no queues and it all went relatively smoothly. Getting through security was very quick and by about 5:45 we were at the gate with our breakfast. The flight left slightly before the scheduled 6:30 departure time and we were in Schiphol just over an hour later.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We had a wait of about three hours before our 11:50 flight to Bonaire. We resisted the temptation to go directly to the bar and sat around for an hour or so taking it in turns to go and look around the airport. At 10, we did return to our usual bar (Taste of the Lowlands) for the traditional pre-flight beer. The beer from the t'IJ brewery that we usually have had been removed from the menu but it had been replaced with beers from a couple of other Dutch breweries so not the end of the world. We just had the one drink before making our way to the gate about an hour before departure.
        </p>

		<p class="diary-text">
			The flight was almost totally full so took a while to load meaning that we took off slightly late but other than that, once again, everything went reasonably smoothly. Apart from having to wear masks all the time it was not really any different to any other flight. The service was a bit slow to start but once we had eaten and everything had been cleared away, things improved and we were able to get a few bottles of wine. We had to stop drinking earlier than usual as the flight was going directly to Bonaire instead of going via Aruba but it was an enjoyable few hours anyway.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We landed in Bonaire slightly early at 3:25pm. Before going through immigration, we had all our paperwork checked again and had to book another PCR test for day 5 of our stay, again due to The UK being on the red list. We seemed to be the only ones from the flight who had to do this as people from most other countries do not need the test so getting through everything did not take much longer than usual. We had a bit of a wait for our luggage but within an hour of landing, we were at the PB car hire office where we collected a pick-up truck that we will have for the next ten days.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We were at Sand Dollar before 5pm and checked into a one bedroom apartment, D09, which we think is the same one we stayed in in 2015. We put our luggage in the apartment and went out about half an hour later to the supermarkets to stock up on food for the next few days. After getting back again, we unpacked and then went to Captain Don's to get take-away pizzas which we ate in the apartment. We were both totally knackered by this time having been awake for over 22 hours and not getting much sleep last night. The build up to the trip had been quite stressful with all the paperwork and uncertainty about whether or not we would get here but it was a relief to finally be here and  to start getting ready for diving again tomorrow.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 27th October</span>
            We were both awake early again but had had a good nights sleep and were feeling a lot better than when we had arrived yesterday. We had a couple of hours to sort out all of our equipment, have breakfast and get to the dive centre by the time it opened at 8:00. The dive centre all seemed a bit chaotic compared to other years. They have changed their policy of allowing you to access tanks 24 hours a day meaning there was a lot of people there to collect their tanks for the day.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			In previous years, we had been allowed to fill out the paperwork and get straight into the water with a minimum of briefing. This time the woman who checked us in insisted that we have the full orientation and that we had to wait until 9:00 as she was giving the briefing to other customers as well. In the end, she started the briefing at about 8:30 for us and one other customer. It was a complete waste of time for us but it did not go on for too long and we were able to get in the water for our first dive at Bari Reef just after 9.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We did not see anything too spectacular on the first dive but it was good to be back underwater. Our regs were brand new and the rest of our equipment had not been used for almost two years so it was good to find that everything still worked.... and that we still knew how to use it! Bari Reef was the same as when we last dived it but no turtle sightings this time.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As usual here, we did not go too far on our first day and stuck to the house reefs. We did the second dive at The Cliff. This was a very good dive. We had been told about a sea-horse by dive3rs coming out as we were going in and more by luck than judgment, managed to spot it about 20 minutes into the dive. We spent a bit of time taking photos of it in both directions and then towards the end of the dive, Roz spotted the first turtle of the trip. This was quite a sleepy green turtle who was not that bothered by us and was a good way to end the dive.
        </p>

			Third dive of the day was at Something Special. Again a nice enough dive without anything too spectacular. It had started raining as we were getting into the water and by the time we came out it was torrential. We had left the truck windows open as usual so the inside of the car was soaked. We stopped to collect more tanks at Yellow Sub and returned to the apartment for cups of tea to warm up. When we had landed yesterday, the heat had felt horrendous and we had eaten our pizzas in the apartment as even at 8pm, it was too hot to eat outside the air-conditioning. The difference in 24 hours was unbelievable.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After just about getting warm again, we put our wet gear back on and walked down to the entry point for Bari Reef. Although the rain had stopped by this point it was still very dark and this was just about a night dive. Another enjoyable dive although it is still slightly sad diving here at this time and not seeing any turtles.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We washed our gear and returned to the apartment. We had decided to have a few days of not going out so cooked pasta for tea. Tonight it was cool enough to eat on our balcony!
