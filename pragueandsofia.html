            We left Kingsclere at 6:30 and had a 90 minute drive to Heathrow Terminal 2. We left the car in the meet and great car park and went straight through security to wait for our 9:10 flight to Cologne. We arrived in Cologne on time just after 11:00 and had a three a half hour wait for our onward flight to Dresden.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/praguesofia/praguesofia001.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent most of this time in the Sion Bar drinking wheat beer and had one more in a bar by the gate when our flight was slightly delayed. We just missed an S-Bahn into the centre when we got through the airport so had another beer each while we waited for the next one. Already quite pissed when we arrived in Dresden!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was a ten minute walk from the Hautbahnhof to our hotel, The Star Inn Hotel on the edge of the Aldstadt. We dropped our bags in the room and went straight out to look around the old town. The town was spectacular and it was an enjoyable pace to wander around. Dresden has a few bars selling Munich beer and we stopped for drinks at Hofbrau and Paulaner bars on the way before walking out to a restaurant, Zum Schießhaus which was recommended by Lonely Planet. We had very good meals in there although I only vaguely remember eating mine. We were back in the hotel before 10 pm.
            </p>

            We were up by 8:00, left the hotel and walked back to the station stopping to buy breakfast on the way. We had tickets for the 9:10 train to Prague which departed on time. The train was not full so it was a very comfortable journey despite feeling slightly rough from yesterday's beer. We arrived in Prague on time at about 11:30 and after working out how to exit the station, walked to The White Lion Hotel where we had a reservation for tonight. We were  able to check in to our room straight away, spent half an hour or so in the room and headed out for the day just before 1:00.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/praguesofia/praguesofia002.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We were staying in the Žižkov area of Prague and had about a 25 minute walk to the old town where our first stop was the Hilton Hotel to pick up our tickets for tonight. We walked from there around a couple of the main squares taking photos of the astrological clock, etc. All quite good to look at but as with previous trips to Prague, too many tourists around to make us want to spend much time in the area. We did not bother with Wenceslas Square or Charles Bridge, instead deciding to go for our first beer of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We started walking out towards U Fleku, Prague's most famous bar but stopped at a couple of other places, U Dvou koček and U Medvídků on the way. We had food and a beer in the first of these places and a couple more beers in the second. Steve and Mick arrived in Prague while we were in U Medvídků and we arranged to meet them in Hospoda U Kruhu, a bar that had been recommended to us by Regan. We met them there along with a few others and stayed in there for a couple more drinks. At this point, we were 4.3km from the ground. Everyone was keen on going to the ground by tram but Roz and I wanted to walk so headed off on our own just after 18:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was about a 45 minute walk to the ground and with three stops on the way (Demínka, U Bulínů and U KLokone) we got there about 30 minutes before the 20:45 kick-off. Getting in was surprisingly straight-forward and we were in our seats with Steve again 20 minutes before the game started. The game itself was crap, the worst performance we have seen from England for a long time and a thoroughly deserved defeat. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">From the ground, it wa only a couple of miles back to our hotel so we said goodbye to the others and started walking back. We found another couple of bars on the way back - Vinohradský pivovar which had the best beer of the day and Restaurace & Club Osudová Přitažlivost which was also very good. We stopped for a kebab before getting back to the hotel to round off what had been a very enjoyable day despite the football.

            We had breakfast at the hotel, checked out at 11:00 and walked back to the station to wait for the 11:50 train to Bratislava. Once again, the train journey was very good. The train was no-where near full so we had plenty of space and it was another comfortable journey. We arrived in Bratislava about 30 minutes late at 16:20.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We were staying at The Tatra Hotel again. We had a list of the 10 best beer pubs in Bratislava and stopped at Fabrika on the way to the hotel for our first beer of the day. From there, it was only 500m to the hotel. We checked in, put our luggage in the room and went to the bar for our complimentary slivavich.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went straight out from there to Meštiansky pivovar a beer hall that we have been to a couple of times before. We had two drinks and something to eat in there before walking into the old town. Our favourite restaurant from previous visits had closed down but we went the bar that we first visited about 28 years ago was still there so as usual, we called in there for one. We then visited another couple of bars from the list - Čierny pes (Black Dog) and Žil Verne, both very good. We had another beer in "Unorthodox" and then a final couple back in Meštiansky pivovar. Don't really remember getting back to the hotel!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 13th October</span>
            We checked out of the hotel after breakfast, just after 11:00. We walked down through the old town to the bus stops by the bridge but there was not too much info there about the airport buses. We knew there were more options form the main bus station so after a bit of dithering walked out there instead. We booked tickets on-line for the 1:15 bus to Vienna Airport and had a wait of about 30 minutes before it left.
            </p>              
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/praguesofia/praguesofia004.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">While waiting for the bus, Roz tried to check-in for tomorrows flight from Vienna to Sofia. She was having problems finding the flight and then discovered that Adria Airlines, who we were supposed to be flying with had gone bust a couple of weeks ago and our booking had been canceled. At this point it was unclear whether or not we would get to Sofia for the football. There were a few options open to us including a 13 hour bus trip but none of them were that appealing. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had booked the flights through Austrian Airways so went straight to their desk when we arrived at the airport. They were very helpful and gave us a few choices of flights that would get us to Sofia tomorrow. We chose to fly via Frankfurt departing at about the same time as our direct flight would have left. Not an ideal route but at least we knew we would get there on time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once that panic was over, we walked to the hotel we had booked, dropped off our bags in the room and went back to the airport to get the S-Bahn into Vienna. We got the S-Bahn to Mitte and then a U-Bahn to near the 7 Stern Brewery, one of our favourite bars from previous trips to Vienna. We had lunch and a few drinks in there before crossing the road to "Centimeter", another very good bar for a few more. We had planned to go a bit further afield but the Kangeroo Bar that we wanted to visit was closed and there did not seem a lot of point in moving on. We had one more drink in another not so good bar before getting the train back to the airport again. We had a final couple of beers in the airport bar before walking back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Monday, 14th October</span>
            We were up before 6:00, had quick showers and walked back across to the airport. The flight left on time and we were in Frankfurt by about 8:30. We were both feeling a bit rough by this point so had a much needed McDonalds for breakfast. Our next flight was also on time and we made it into Sofia by 1:40 local time. (four hours later than if we had been on our direct flight!)
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">We got the metro into the centre of Sofia and were met outside the apartment we had booked by the owner/manager. After she had let us in and shown us around, we went straight out again. It was a 1.5 mile walk to the National Palace of Culture where the FA had their ticket collection point set up.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/praguesofia/praguesofia005.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
            Steve had told us that he was in a bar near the ticket collection point but he had moved on by the time we got there. The bar looked a bit crap anyway so we were happy to move on without having  a drink. We walked to a craft beer pub about ten minutes away but found it was closed so stopped for a beer at another place near-by. The beer here was not great so we decided to walk to The Ale House, a place we had been in on our last visit to Sofia and also near to where Steve had moved to. We did not make it as far as The Ale House as we found an excellent craft beer bar - Nosferatu - on the way. We initially stopped for one drink but it really was an excellent bar and we ended up being in there for four hours. Steve, Mick and Rob joined us in there and it was an excellent way to spend the afternoon/evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We left Nosferatu at about 8:45, an hour before kick-off. It was only a short walk to the ground but neither of us remember leaving the bar or getting into the ground. We had sobered up a bit by the time the game kicked off so were still able to enjoy the football. A much better performance than on Friday although the game will sadly be remembered more for the racism from the Bulgarian fans than for the actual match.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were held in the ground for about 20 minutes after the final whistle and then walked back to our apartment. There was nothing open on the way back so were unable to stop for kebabs or more beer. Back in the apartment by about 1am.
