          We were up at 4:30 and left Kingsclere at exactly 5:00. There were a few delays due to roadworks and the particularly unnecessary "Operation Stack" on the M20 but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at Dover before 7:30. The queues to get through French immigration were not too bad and we had checked in for the 8:25 P&O ferry to Calais by about 7:40. We had been told that there was a delay of about 20 minutes. We started boarding at 8:25 and did leave about 20 minutes later. We had breakfast on the ferry and arrived in Calais at about 11:30. By midday, we were on the motorway heading towards Belgium and Germany.

          We were heading for Aachen again. We had a couple of stops on the way. One to drop off our empties in Adinkerke and one at a service station after Brussels for lunch. There were a few holdups along the way but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor in Aachen at about 4:30.

          We dropped our stuff off in the room and went back down for our first beer of the trip in the hotel "beer garden". After that, we headed into town stopping for one in the Goldenes Schwein on the way. We called in for one at Poststübchen and ended up staying in there for a few. It is a nice pub type place with good music and cheap beer. We walked from there to Zum goldenen Einhorn where we had a couple more then one in each of the Ratskeller and the Domkeller. We had not eaten anything so were quite pissed and back in the hotel by 10pm.

          A slightly later start today as we did not get up until 10. We checked out of the hotel at 11, left the car in the car park and went for a walk around Aachen. We had breakfast in a bakery near the Novotel and then walked through the centre past the Rathaus and Cathedral. We were back at the hotel by about 12:10 and on our way again about five minutes later.

          We had a drive of just over 100 miles to get to Trier today. A lot of the journey as on single carriageway roads so it was a bit slower than some trips but we were still at the B&B in Trier by about 3:30. We put our stuff in the room and went straight out on our bikes for a few hours. We cycled through the centre and down to the Moselle where we joined the Moselle cycle path. We will be starting a five day trip along the river to Koblenz tomorrow so today headed up-river in the other direction. We cycled about 11 miles to Wasserbillig, just over the Luxembourg border. After looking round the town for about ten minutes trying unsuccessfully to find an ice-cream shop we gave up and cycled back to Trier.

          After showers, we walked back into the centre of Trier. We had a look at Porta Nigra which is the main sight in the city. From there we walked through the pedestrianised bit to the cathedral. We were getting hungry by this time. As we left the cathedral area, we found a burger place that quite appealed. We had excellent burgers with just the one beer and walked back to the hotel.

          <span class="diary-date">Saturday 3rd June - Trier to Trittenheim - 27.9 miles - 321 ft</span>
          We were up by 9ish and spent half an hour or so sorting out our stuff for the next five days. Everything we needed to take with us was put into the panniers and the rest in bags to be left in the car. After attaching everything to the bikes, we left the hotel at about 9:40. We cycled back into the centre and had breakfast on seats by Porta Nigra.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
          After eating, we followed the cycle route back to the river and the Moselradweg. We were heading for Trittenheim which is only about 13 miles away from Trier in a straight line. However, this section of the Moselle is quite windy so sticking to the river path makes it a journey of about 28 miles. It was a very pleasant ride. The route did have the odd section through industrial areas or along main roads but the vast majority of it was along the river or through the vineyards. The vineyards on the steep hills were quite spectacular in places and together with all the weinguts and wine gardens along the way, they made us quite keen to start drinking wine by the time we arrived in Trirrenheim!

          Unusually, the journey was slightly shorter than expected and we arrived in Trittenheim at about 1:20. We had a room booked at "Gästehaus Annette Hermes-Hoffmann" and were able to check in as soon as we arrived. We dropped off our luggage and went straight out to look for something for lunch. Trittenheim is a nice little town but  it does not have many shops and any that it does have were by now closed for the weekend. The Esso garage near our Gästehaus did have a small shop so we were able to buy food but there were not too many other options. We ate on our balcony which just about overlooks the river before having showers and an afternoon of not doing a lot.

          The F.A. Cup Final kicked off at 4pm but it took us until half way through the second half to find the WiFi password. We watched the end of the match and started on the wine at 6. Our fridge contained nine bottles of wine from the winery attached to the guest house. We took one of the cheaper ones and sat on the terrace that we share with the other room here. It was s very nice spot with great views of the river and vineyards on the other side. After finishing that we walked into the centre of Trittenheim.

          We had been told that we would need to reserve a table if we wanted to eat out tonight. This had confused us as there did not seem to be that many people around but once in the centre we found that all but a couple of the restaurants were closed meaning that the ones that were open were quite full. We had booked a table at Pizza Pinochio for 8pm but ended up getting there earlier as we gave up on our planned drink stop. We had good pizzas with more wine and then returned to the room for another bottle while joining the video chat.

          <span class="diary-date">Sunday 4th June - Trittenheim to Zeltingen-Rachtig - 23.5 miles - 437 ft</span>
          After eating the included breakfast, we loaded up the bikes and were on our way again by 10:00. We crossed the river and rejoined the Radweg. It was another enjoyable ride. There were a few more small towns to cycle through today and plenty of time along the river and through the vineyards again.

          We were not expecting to be able to get into our apartment until 2pm so stopped for an hour or so at Bernkastel. We found a bench with good views of the river and sat and had ice-creams. We then took it in turns to wander round what was a very picturesque little town. We headed off again at and arrived in Zeltingen-Rachtig at about 1:30. We were able to get straight into the apartment.
