          We were up at 4:30 and left Kingsclere at exactly 5:00. There were a few delays due to roadworks and the particularly unnecessary "Operation Stack" on the M20 but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at Dover before 7:30. The queues to get through French immigration were not too bad and we had checked in for the 8:25 P&O ferry to Calais by about 7:40. We had been told that there was a delay of about 20 minutes. We started boarding at 8:25 and did leave about 20 minutes later. We had breakfast on the ferry and arrived in Calais at about 11:30. By midday, we were on the motorway heading towards Belgium and Germany.

          We were heading for Aachen again. We had a couple of stops on the way. One to drop off our empties in Adinkerke and one at a service station after Brussels for lunch. There were a few holdups along the way but the journey was not too bad and we arrived at the Ibis Marschiertor in Aachen at about 4:30.

          We dropped our stuff off in the room and went back down for our first beer of the trip in the hotel "beer garden". After that, we headed into town stopping for one in the Goldenes Schwein on the way. We called in for one at Poststübchen and ended up staying in there for a few. It is a nice pub type place with good music and cheap beer. We walked from there to Zum goldenen Einhorn where we had a couple more then one in each of the Ratskeller and the Domkeller. We had not eaten anything so were quite pissed and back in the hotel by 10pm.

          A slightly later start today as we did not get up until 10. We checked out of the hotel at 11, left the car in the car park and went for a walk around Aachen. We had breakfast in a bakery near the Novotel and then walked through the centre past the Rathaus and Cathedral. We were back at the hotel by about 12:10 and on our way again about five minutes later.

          We had a drive of just over 100 miles to get to Trier today. A lot of the journey as on single carriageway roads so it was a bit slower than some trips but we were still at the B&B in Trier by about 3:30. We put our stuff in the room and went straight out on our bikes for a few hours. We cycled through the centre and down to the Moselle where we joined the Moselle cycle path. We will be starting a five day trip along the river to Koblenz tomorrow so today headed up-river in the other direction. We cycled about 11 miles to Wasserbillig, just over the Luxembourg border. After looking round the town for about ten minutes trying unsuccessfully to find an ice-cream shop we gave up and cycled back to Trier.

          After showers, we walked back into the centre of Trier. We had a look at Porta Nigra which is the main sight in the city. From there we walked through the pedestrianised bit to the cathedral. We were getting hungry by this time. As we left the cathedral area, we found a burger place that quite appealed. We had excellent burgers with just the one beer and walked back to the hotel.
