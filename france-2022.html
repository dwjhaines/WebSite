            As we were still not being allowed into Belgium, our trip to Ghent and Brussels by Eurostar had to be replaced with a four day car trip to France. We had planned to drive down to Dover early tomorrow but the Dover Travelodge was only £25 for tonight so we decided to head down today instead. We left Kingsclere just before 3 having just about recovered from "Rainbow Night".
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			It was an uneventful drive down to Dover. There were no problems with the traffic and we were in Dover and checked into the hotel just after 5. The Travelodge was still being built the last time we were in Dover so we have not stayed there before. It is in an ideal location near the port, has free parking and being new, is a lot better than some Travelodges. After an hour or so in the room we went out to eat. We looked at a couple of pizza places before settling on eating in the Wetherspoons. We had one drink with the meal but neither of us felt like drinking so we returned to the hotel straight after the meal. We managed to stay awake to watch the Bournemouth v Borehamwood FA Cup match but were asleep not long after it finished.
        </p>

            <span class="diary-date">Monday 7th February</span>
            We were awake by 7, had quick showers and checked out of the hotel by 7:30. We bought breakfast from Greggs near the hotel and then had a couple of minutes drive to the port. We had given ourselves plenty of time but the port was empty and we were straight through in a few minutes meaning that we had just over an hour to wait for the ferry. The ferry was also fairly empty so we had plenty of space for the 90 minute journey.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got to Calais at around midday and were one of the first vehicles off the ferry. Our first stop was Self2015, the beer shop just over the Belgian border that we had stopped at on the way home from Germany last year. We got rid of all our empties and filled up the boot with another nine cases of full bottles.

			We crossed back into France and had a drive of about 50 minutes to our hotel - The Royal Hainaut Spa in Valenciennes. We had chosen Valenciennes because of the hotel. The hotel is in a spectacular former hospital, built in 1750. The rooms all have large lounge areas and an upstairs bedroom. The spa is in underground with vaulted ceilings and is very spectacular itself and there is also a sauna and steam room.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We got to the hotel just before 3pm but were told that our room would not be ready until 4. Roz went out to buy bread pate and cheese for lunch which we ate as soon as we got the room. We then went down to the spa for half an hour or so - a few lengths of the pool and a couple of sessions in the steam room.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After showers, we had a couple of glasses of wine while Roz opened some of her birthday presents. We went out at 7ish and went to a couple of bars in the centre of Valenciennes. First stop was Boston Company. This was quite a big bar that had a few Belgian beers. We had a few Kwaks each in there before moving  to "Au Fût et à mesure". This was more of a craft beer type bar. Not as nice but it did have pints of Tripel Karmeliet for €7.50. We had planned on going back to Boston Company but after a couple of pints, realised this was probably not a good idea so returned to the hotel for a relatively early night. We had not drunk that much but had not eaten anything so neither of us clearly remember walking back to the hotel.

            We had breakfast included with the room so were up by about 9. Breakfast was excellent and worth getting up for but it was straight back to bed after we had eaten for a couple of hours. We were not too hungover due to not drinking that much last night but I seem to be tired quite a lot of the time at the moment and we were both in need of sleep.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			At midday, Roz went off to the spa. I stayed in the room for an hour and then went out for a walk around the town. Nothing too spectacular to see - the hotel really is the highlight, but a nice enough place to wander around for an hour or so. We were both back in the room by 2:30 and then went out again to get something to eat for lunch and to look at restaurant options for tonight. We walked out to the other side of the town and then stopped for a sandwich in a shopping centre on our way back to the hotel
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			I had planned to go back to the Spa after our walk but we seemed to manage to run out of time. Instead, we had a couple of glasses of wine and headed out again at 6ish. We stopped for a beer at Le Palais de la Biere. This place was closed yesterday but had looked to be one of the best beer bars in the town. It was not the nicest of bars but the staff were friendly enough and it had a good range of beers including an 8% Belgian Triple for €6 a pint. 
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We walked from there to the other side of the main square. We had narrowed our choice of restaurants down to two. One of them had closed for the day at 3pm leaving us with Auberge du Bon Fermier. This did not work out too badly. It was a nice restaurant and we both had very good two course meals for €15 each. We had a couple of beers before the meal and a bottle of wine with out food. After eating we went back to Boston Company for another couple of Kwaks each and then had a final beer at Le Palais de la Biere before getting back to the hotel just before 11.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 9th February</span>
            I seem to have picked up some sort of virus and was feeling quite rough again when we got up. We went for breakfast and then I did make it to the spa again although did not do a lot apart from a few minutes in the steam room. We returned to the room at midday for showers and checked out just before 1pm.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			As it was a nice day we decided that instead of driving straight to Arras, we would go via the Thiepval Memorial. We had seen it before but thought that going in the winter there would be less people there and it is quite spectacular sight. It turned out to be a waste of time. The whole monument was covered in scaffolding as it is undergoing renovation work and we were not able to walk through it. We left the memorial a few minutes after getting to it and continued onto Arras stopping for lunch at a supermarket on the way.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived in Arras at about 3:30 and parked the car in the underground car park that had been closed on our last visit. After sleeping for an hour or so (I seem to need to sleep after doing anything at the moment) we went out for a walk around the town. We walked round the two main squares. Lots of excellent looking little bars with decent ranges of beers but sadly, I did not really feel up to drinking so we did not stop in any of them. We returned to the hotel, where we did have a couple of glasses of wine before going to eat in a restaurant near the hotel - L’Élysée. This was a place that we had visited a couple of times in 2016.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			Although I did not feel like drinking, they had a very good triple on tap so we had a few beers with our meals. The food was excellent - one of the best burgers I have ever had. We left the restaurant after eating and went straight back to the hotel for a relatively sober and early night.
