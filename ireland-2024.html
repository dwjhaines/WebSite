              <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 3rd September</span>
              We were heading over to Ireland for six nights due to England playing in Dublin on Saturday. We had booked the trip using our Air Lingus credit from Euro2020 and had booked it all before finding out that we were unable to get tickets for the game. Too many missed games in the last couple of years mean that we are no longer high enough in the caps table to guarantee tickets when the allocation is small as it was for this game. We decided to go anyway and see a bit of a country that we have not seen that much of in the past.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The holiday did not get off to the best of starts. We left Kingsclere at 6:45, drove to Southampton airport, parked and got through into departures very smoothly. However, I had arranged a telephone consultation with a doctor regarding the biopsy I had done on my prostate a week or so ago. He phoned me while we were sat in departures and confirmed that I did have prostate cancer. We had been fairly aware of this since the biopsy but the diagnosis was worse than expected and will require more tests to see if it has spread outside the prostrate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We did not have too long to think about this before having to decide whether or not we should continue with the trip. I was close to going home but we decided to carry on as planned and if we have to cut it short and go home then so be it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We boarded the plane and departed on time at 9:40. Quite a good flight including unexpected views of The Liberty as we flew over Swansea. We landed in Dublin just after 11 and got through immigration quickly but then had to wait over an hour to collect our hire car. We were collecting it from Europcar who seemed to have more customers than all the other agencies put together and the whole process seemed very slow and inefficient. However, by 12:45 we had our car and were on our way out of the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were heading for Limerick and decided to visit Cashel on the way. This is a small town known for The Rock of Cashel, a "medieval complex" on a hill overlooking the town. We arrived in Cashel by about 12:30 and first went to the slightly out of town Tesco from where the car park had surprisingly good views of The Rock. We had lunch sat in the car park and then drove out to the base of the hill where the castle is. We parked at the bottom and walked up to it but decided not to go in as you had to pay.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We walked down into the centre, through the town and back to the car. We probably would have walked a bit further but the weather which had been poor for a lot of the drive was starting to get wet again so we gave up and continued our drive to Limerick. We found the Absolute Hotel and checked into the room we had booked.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went out for the evening at about 6:30. There seemed to be quite a few good pubs in Limerick so a pub crawl seemed a good idea. We started in the Treaty City Brewery about 10 minutes walk from the hotel in the medieval part of the town and then walked down to the river for our first pints of Guinness in The Locke Bar.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We then walked to another brewery - Crew Brewing Co - which had excellent beer. We had a couple in there and then headed to an area which had three pubs that I was keen on. We stopped for one in Flannery's, a typical small Irish pub before we got there and then made it to Mother Mac's, the first of the three. This  was an excellent place with a good range of beers (and whiskeys) and we did not get any further. We had seats at the bar and had three drinks here before walking back to the hotel. A very enjoyable end to the day!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 4th September</span>
              We had a very good breakfast included and after eating, we returned to the room until we had to check out. We checked out at midday, put our stuff in the car and then went for a walk around the sights of Limerick. This consisted mainly of a not too impressive castle and a couple of bridges. Nothing overly spectacular but all nice enough to wander around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              Tonight we were staying at Doolin, a base for exploring The Cliffs of Mohir. As we did not have too much else to do today, we decided on a slight detour to have a look round Galway. We stopped for lunch and a look at the castle in Oranmore and got into Galway by about 3pm. We did most of the Lonely Planet walking tour which again was all quite nice,  particularly The Latin Quarter.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              After we had managed to get out of the car park, we had a drive of about an hour and a half to get to Doolin. It was not that far away but there was a lot of traffic getting out of Galway and then a lot of narrow windy roads to get to Doolin. The scenery along the way was spectacular and it was quite an enjoyable drive.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had booked to stay for two nights at "Doolin Glamping", a campsite with five large luxurious tents. We were not really sure what to expect here but the "tent" we were shown to was excellent with plenty of space a comfortable bed and a powerful heater.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
              border="0"

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went out to eat at about 6:30. There is not a lot in Doolin apart from accommodation and pubs. We walked through the village and eventually settled on McDermott's. The food in here was excellent. After eating, we walked a mile or so to the other side of the village before returning to the tent. We booked tickets for a trip to the cliffs for tomorrow morning and had a relatively early, quiet night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Thursday 5th September</span>
              We were up quite early and left the camp site at about 7:40. The tent had been fine for sleeping in.... except for the walk to the toilet block at 3:30! We drove to the nearest shop, a mile away on the main road and bought sandwiches for breakfast and then drove another 5 or 6 miles to the Moher Cliffs visitors centre. Our tickets meant that we could park there between 8 and 11. It was the cheapest time of the day to park and also meant that we could visit the cliffs before all the bus tours arrived.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              A couple of sections of the path that goes along the cliffs is closed at the moment but we were able to walk about a mile North of the centre past O'Brian's tower and then half a mile back the other way. The views were excellent and getting there at the time meant that we did manage to avoid the crowds. We also had the best weather of the day. We spent about 20 minutes in the visitor centre and shop before driving back to the camp site.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went out again at about 11:30. The coast path goes through Doolin and we started walking from the camp site back towards the visitors centre. We got as far as the point where the path is closed before turning round and walking back. Again, the walk was very scenic and it has been worth spending two nights here to give us the chance to see more of the cliffs. We stopped for ice-creams on the way back to the camp site and were back for a lazy afternoon by about 3pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We went back to McDermott's again in the evening. It was a nice pub and we had both enjoyed the food there last night so there did not seem any point in trying anywhere different. I had the Irish Stew (which Roz had yesterday) and a couple of pints of Guinness and it was back to the camp site for another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              <span class="diary-date">Friday 6th September</span>
              Tuesday's news had started to have a bit more of an impact on us both in the last 24 hours. I was starting to get quite worried about it all, neither of us are sleeping well and Roz in particular is getting quite stressed about the lack of updates or news about what is happening next. I had been given a number to call if I had any questions and tried ringing at 9. I had to leave a message to get them to call me back but eventually did get to speak to one of the cancer nurses (Precious, who I have spoken to before).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              She was quite reassuring and explained that there was no urgency to get anything done and I should hear something within the next two or three weeks. She also told me that the chances of the cancer having spread outside the prostate is very low and this is unlikely to change while I wait for further tests (the next step is a PET scan). Three days of worrying about the diagnosis had probably made things seem a lot worse than they really are and we were both feeling a lot happier about things as a result of this phone call.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              I had driven back to the petrol station to buy breakfast before my phone calls but we did not have to check out of the camp site until 11:00. I went for a walk down to the ferry pier, about 2km away while Roz stayed at the site. After packing, we checked out, left the car at the camp site and walked to the craft shop just down the road. We eventually left the camp site at about 11:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were heading back to the East coast today but had a couple of stops on the way. First of all was the Hazel Mountain Chocolate Shop where they made very nice if slightly expensive chocolate. We then continued to the small town of Kinvarra. We parked the car, walked round the farmers market, bought sausage rolls for lunch and ate them sat looking at the harbour. All very pleasant!
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We left Kinvarra at 1pm and had a fairly uneventful drive of almost exactly three hours to Bray where we will stay for the next two nights. We had chosen Bray as it was cheaper than staying in Dublin but is on the Dublin DART public transport system. We are still unsure about whether or not we will go into Dublin without tickets tomorrow but we do have the option.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We found the Firefly Hotel and parked in a car park round the corner. After a few problems trying to pay for parking and getting our keys from the safe box, we able to get into our room by about 4:30.
