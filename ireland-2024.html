              We were heading over to Ireland for six nights due to England playing in Dublin on Saturday. We had booked the trip using our Air Lingus credit from Euro2020 and had booked it all before finding out that we were unable to get tickets for the game. Too many missed games in the last couple of years mean that we are no longer high enough in the caps table to guarantee tickets when the allocation is small as it was for this game. We decided to go anyway and see a bit of a country that we have not seen that much of in the past.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              The holiday did not get off to the best of starts. We left Kingsclere at 6:45, drove to Southampton airport, parked and got through into departures very smoothly. However, I had arranged a telephone consultation with a doctor regarding the biopsy I had done on my prostate a week or so ago. He phoned me while we were sat in departures and confirmed that I did have prostate cancer. We had been fairly aware of this since the biopsy but the diagnosis was worse than expected and will require more tests to see if it has spread outside the prostrate.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We did not have too long to think about this before having to decide whether or not we should continue with the trip. I was close to going home but we decided to carry on as planned and if we have to cut it short and go home then so be it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We boarded the plane and departed on time at 9:40. We landed in Dublin just after 11 and got through immigration quickly but then had to wait over an hour to collect our hire car. We were collecting it from Europcar who seemed to have more customers than all the other agencies put together and the whole process seemed very slow and inefficient. However, by 12:45 we had our car and were on our way out of the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We were heading for Limerick and decided to visit Cashel on the way. This is a small town known for The Rock of Cashel, a "medieval complex" on a hill overlooking the town. We arrived in Cashel by about 12:30 and first went to the slightly out of town Tesco from where the car park had surprisingly good views of The Rock. We had lunch sat in the car park and then drove out to the base of the hill where the castle is. We parked at the bottom and walked up to it but decided not to go in as you had to pay.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-centre"><img
              border="0"

            </div>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We walked down into the centre, through the town and back to the car. We probably would have walked a bit further but the weather which had been poor for a lot of the drive was starting to get wet again so we gave up and continued our drive to Limerick. We found the Absolute Hotel and checked into the room we had booked.
