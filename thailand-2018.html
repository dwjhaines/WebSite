                We left Kingsclere at 4:30ish and were leaving the car at Heathrow by about 5:45. We had already checked in so we just had to drop off our bags before going through security. A quick stop in the duty free shop and we were sat in the lounge by about 18:30, three hours before departure.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was the same lounge we have used before (Plaza Premium) but was free this time through Roz's Amex card. We had a couple of hours of drinking time before heading off to our gate just before 21:00. Boarding was fairly quick and the flight (Eva Air BR67) took off roughly on time at 21:23. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The plane was totally full but had plenty of legroom so reasonably comfortable. The service was not great but we managed to have a few glasses of wine before falling asleep not long after midnight.

                I was awake by about 5:00 - midday Thai time. We were served breakfast and arrived on time at 15:25. It took about an hour to get through immigration and take out money, etc and just over an hour in a taxi to Evergreen Place where we are staying for one night. We got upgraded to a one bedroom apartment which we were in just before 6:00. Definitely one of the nicest rooms we have had in Bangkok!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went down and stocked up on provisions from 7-11 before having showers, and had a couple of drinks in the room before heading out. We walked down to Siam Square and went to our usual restaurant, Ban Khun Mae, where the food was  excellent as usual. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and returned to the room to continue drinking. We got through quite a bit of our duty free Bacardi and do not remember a lot about going to bed.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th February</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at midday, left our bags in reception and walked down to MBK for a late breakfast. We bought a few things that we needed - plug adapters, a Thai SIM and a couple of courses of amoxicillin - before walking back to the hotel. We had an hour or so to kill so stayed by the pool until 3:00 before getting a taxi out to Don Mueang airport. 
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">The journey this time only took about 25 minutes due to not much traffic and a very fast taxi. We dropped our bags off without any problems despite them being heavier than our allowance and had lunch in McDonalds before going through to departures. We had been notified a couple of days ago about the flight time changing by 55 minutes but we left on time at the re-scheduled time of 17:55.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Flight time was 1hr 10 min. We collected our luggage and then joined all the other Westerners from the flight on the Nok Air bus into Ranong, 23km away. By about 9:00 we were checked into the B Hotel for the night. We dropped our stuff in the room and went out to eat and look for somewhere showing football. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found a restaurant that was showing football and had a pretty good meal and a few drinks. At 10:00, we asked if they would turn the tele over for the Swansea game but apparently, everyone wanted to watch Everton v Palace so we returned to the room and followed our games on the internet instead. We had a few more drinks in the room and got to bed just after midnight.
            </p>

                We were in Ranong to join up with a one week live-aboard into Burma. After breakfast, we walked to the Smiling Seahorse office to drop off our dive gear. We also completed all our paperwork and left them with our passports and $500 for visas and diving fees. We had done all this by about 10:30 which gave us a few hours to kill until the 15:00 pick-up. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed in our room until midday and then spent an hour or so at the small rooftop pool. At 1:30 we went for lunch at The Farmhouse, the restaurant we were due to be picked up from.
