                We left Kingsclere at 4:30ish and were leaving the car at Heathrow by about 5:45. We had already checked in so we just had to drop off our bags before going through security. A quick stop in the duty free shop and we were sat in the lounge by about 18:30, three hours before departure.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was the same lounge we have used before (Plaza Premium) but was free this time through Roz's Amex card. We had a couple of hours of drinking time before heading off to our gate just before 21:00. Boarding was fairly quick and the flight (Eva Air BR67) took off roughly on time at 21:23. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The plane was totally full but had plenty of legroom so reasonably comfortable. The service was not great but we managed to have a few glasses of wine before falling asleep not long after midnight.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday 9th February</span>
                I was awake by about 5:00 - midday Thai time. We were served breakfast and arrived on time at 15:25. It took about an hour to get through immigration and take out money, etc and just over an hour in a taxi to Evergreen Place where we are staying for one night. We got upgraded to a one bedroom apartment which we were in just before 6:00. Definitely one of the nicest rooms we have had in Bangkok!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">We went down and stocked up on provisions from 7-11 before having showers, and had a couple of drinks in the room before heading out. We walked down to Siam Square and went to our usual restaurant, Ban Khun Mae, where the food was  excellent as usual. We had a bottle of Sang Som with our meal and returned to the room to continue drinking. We got through quite a bit of our duty free Bacardi and do not remember a lot about going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday 10th February</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at midday, left our bags in reception and walked down to MBK for a late breakfast. We bought a few things that we needed - plug adapters, a Thai SIM and a couple of courses of amoxicillin - before walking back to the hotel. We had an hour or so to kill so stayed by the pool until 3:00 before getting a taxi out to Don Mueang airport. 
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-02.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The journey this time only took about 25 minutes due to not much traffic and a very fast taxi. We dropped our bags off without any problems despite them being heavier than our allowance and had lunch in McDonalds before going through to departures. We had been notified a couple of days ago about the flight time changing by 55 minutes but we left on time at the re-scheduled time of 17:55.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Flight time was 1hr 10 min. We collected our luggage and then joined all the other Westerners from the flight on the Nok Air bus into Ranong, 23km away. By about 9:00 we were checked into the B Hotel for the night. We dropped our stuff in the room and went out to eat and look for somewhere showing football. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We found a restaurant that was showing football and had a pretty good meal and a few drinks. At 10:00, we asked if they would turn the tele over for the Swansea game but apparently, everyone wanted to watch Everton v Palace so we returned to the room and followed our games on the internet instead. We had a few more drinks in the room and got to bed just after midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday 11th February</span>
                We were in Ranong to join up with a one week live-aboard into Burma. After breakfast, we walked to the Smiling Seahorse office to drop off our dive gear. We also completed all our paperwork and left them with our passports and $500 for visas and diving fees. We had done all this by about 10:30 which gave us a few hours to kill until the 15:00 pick-up. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We stayed in our room until midday and then spent an hour or so at the small rooftop pool. At 1:30 we went for lunch at The Farmhouse, the restaurant we were due to be picked up from. We were picked up on time at 15:00. Roz and I went in a car with NIcole and one of the owners of the dive centre while the other 11 customers went in a songthew type thing. The journey to the pier took about ten minutes.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-03.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We boarded the boat, MV ThaiSea and had a 30 minute boat briefing while we crossed the river to Kawthaung, the Myanmar border town. We had already had our passports stamped with Thai exit stamps and had a 30 minute wait while Myanmar immigration police cam aboard to complete their paperwork. We were not really sure what happened to the $500 we had parted company with or where our passports are currently but everything appeared to go smoothly enough! 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The boat that we will spend the next week on is pretty good considering it is quite a low budget option. We have a cabin at the front of the boat with bunk beds. It is not the most spacious cabin we have ever had but there is enough space for everything we have. The rest of the boat is well laid out with plenty of places to sit and the dive deck looks fine. The lack of air-con may be a problem but the rooms are cool enough with the door open.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Once we had finished with immigration, we started heading North to the location of our first dive site. The first dive will not be until tomorrow but we got all our gear put together not long after leaving Kawthaung. We are being guided by Sophie and have Nicole and Helene in our group. We ate an excellent meal at 8ish - it looks as if the food will be good on this boat. People started heading off to bed straight after the meal and it was not long before we went as well.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 12th February</span>
            Woke just after 6:00 having slept reasonably well despite the heat. First dive was supposed to be at 7:00 but with the extended briefing, and the fact that we were second in the water, meant that we did not jump until just before 8:00.               
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-04.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Four pretty good dives today. The first was basically a check dive. All very straight-forward and easy. A nice enough site with enough to see including a small bamboo shark and lots of tomato anemone fish. The second was a series of three tunnels back and fore through a rock. Loads of fish on this dive and a sea-horse.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dive number three was a bit more of a challenge. This dive started with a longish swim through a narrow cave while trying to negotiate the surge. The briefing put off Nicole and Helene and we were joined instead by one of the Belgian couples on the boat. Sophie was not that keen on going through here as she considered it to be too dangerous but it was not that bad and we all came out the other side without any problems... although I was quite keen on turning back at one point! At the end of the big cave was a smaller cave containing four huge nurse sharks.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did the night dive with a French couple (nowhere near knowing everyone's names yet). This dive was not too bad compared to some we have done. There was enough crabs and shrimps to keep the dive interesting as well as a couple of nudibranchs.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We did not eat until quite late due to the night dive and went to bed at about 10:30.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-05.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday 13th February</span>
            Once again, we were up just after 6:00 after a reasonable nights sleep. We were the first group in the water all day today so after a quick briefing, we jumped just after 7:00. The first two dives were at the same site - North Twin Pinnacle. This was a totally submerged site with the top at about 14m. There was a bit of current around so both dives started with a negative entry. Both dives were very enjoyable with plenty of fish and coral.</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The next two dives were in the same area - North Twin Reef and North Twin Bay. The dive at the Reef was probably my favorite of the day. Again, lots of coral and fish and a couple of sea-snakes. The final dive was a "sunset dive" so we were in the water a bit earlier than yesterday. This was also very good with a couple of octopus at the start and a cave full of lobsters near the end.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
            Another late evening meal and bed by about 11.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday 14th February</span>
            All the dives today were at the same site, Black Rock which is Myanmar's best and most famous site. It is also the Northernmost site that we will visit and is an eight hour overnight journey from where we were yesterday. The boat left at about the same time we went to bed last night and we arrived at about the same time that we were woken up. It was our turn to be the last group in the water today so a slightly later start at 7:34.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-06.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We did three day dives and a night dive here. It was a really nice site with big schools of fish everywhere. There were jacks, barracuda and huge numbers of smaller fish... as well as octopus, cuttle fish, etc, etc. However, the main reason for coming here was for the mantas. We saw one on the first dive (Roz saw two), three or four on the second. Both of these were very good dives but the third was one of the best we have ever done.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We saw the first manta after a couple of minutes and then had an hour of them swimming around us. Initially, all the other divers from the boat were there as well but we had jumped last so had the mantas to ourselves for about the last 30 minutes of the dive. In the brief periods when we could not see any manta, there were still the big schools of jacks and barracuda to look at. It was probably one of the worst dive profiles I have ever had due to the amount of going up and down but an excellent dive nonetheless. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was OK with lots of crabs but was never going to be the highlight of the day. We had a few drinks with the evening meal which was very good again.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-07.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday 15th February</span>
            Another very good days diving. Three dives in the same area - Shark Cave, Submarine and Square Rock, with Square Rock being repeated for the night dive. Both the first two dives were good with a lot of fish, a few juvenile box fish and angel fish and a pineapple fish on the second. Also saw a few peacock mantis shrimps which we had not seen many of previously.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The third dive was very good. Sophie found three sea horses and Roz managed to find a fourth. We had been told about these in the briefing but were not expecting to see them all. We also saw our first ornate ghost pipe fish of the trip. We used to see loads of these in Thailand but have not seen any for a few years. It was good to see that they still exist.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-08.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was done in reasonably strong current and ended in a bit of confusion but was still reasonably enjoyable. We saw our fifth seahorse of the day and Roz and I had a brief sighting of a swimming bamboo shark.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was "bar-b-q night" when we got back on the boat. There was a huge amount of food cooked on the bar-b-q in the seating area and once again it was an excellent meal. We were all given rum cocktails to start the evening and after eating, all played a game involving picking up a cardboard box with our teeth. We are probably getting a bit old for such things but after a few drinks, it was all quite entertaining and it turned out to be a very enjoyable evening. Got to bed sometime after 11:00.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 16th February</span> 
            Four more good dives. The first two were at Sea Fan Forest where as the name suggests there were a lot of huge sea fans particularly in the deeper part of the site. All quite spectacular. On the second dive we saw two more ghost pipe fish and there seemed to be peacock mantis shrimps everywhere.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-09.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">We then moved to an area with a few sites all reasonably close together. We dived first at Eagle Rock which was a superb site particularly in the shallows. An incredible number of fish in the area and it would have been enjoyable just getting in and staying at 5m for the whole dive. Also saw a couple of octopus.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The night dive was just me, Roz and Helene. We were led by Camille. The dive bore no resemblance to the one described in the briefing but involved another cave type tunnel and was all pretty good again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Back on the boat, it was a slightly quieter evening than last night but we finished the bottle of Sang Som we had bought with us before going to bed.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-10.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Saturday 17th February</span> 
            Four more dives today in the area we ended up at yesterday. A very fishy dive site to start with, about 20 minutes away from where we had spent the night. We then returned to the last two sites we did yesterday. We did the cave/tunnel again first and then returned to Eagle Rock where we finally saw our first turtle of the trip, a large hawksbill. I spotted it and we had a few minutes with it before the rest of the group came in for pictures. We stayed with it for about five minutes after everyone else had left and as with most hawksbills, it was eating so was totally un-bothered by us. The rest of the dive was very good but obviously, this was the highlight!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The diving here has been better than expected. We have been surprised by the amount of fish around at a lot of the sites although apparently this is partially due to the Burmese fisherman having time off for Chinese New Year. There has been enough macro stuff around and the manta dive was one of the best ever but the amount of fish generally has meant all the dives have been good. Now we have a turtle sighting as well
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Our final evening on the boat and a fairly similar evening to the others. We had a few drinks while looking at photos of the days diving and got to bed at around 11:00
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-11.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday 18th February</span> 
            The last dive of the trip this morning. We dived at Seahorse City which was probably one of the worst sites of the trip but did have plenty of seahorses. Everyone else seemed to see five or six of them while I only saw three but it was enjoyable enough nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were out of the water just after 9:00 and due back in Ranong between 5:00 and 6:00. Neither of us were really sure why it was going to take so long but the whole day was run at the "relaxed" pace that the rest of the trip had been run at. We had a photo stop at a bay with a nice beach. Lots of team photos, etc before continuing back to Kawthaung where we arrived at about 14:00. This time, we were able to get off the boat and spend an hour on land.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">This hour included as much beer as we wanted to drink, paid for by Frank. We went for a quick walk around the town with Nicole, bought a couple of bottles of Myanmar rum (50 baht each) and then joined everyone else from the trip in the Smile bar. We had an enjoyable 45 minutes in there before getting back on the boat by which time our passports had been collected and we were able to cross the river back into Thailand. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">There was more waiting around at the Thai side while our passports were taken to be stamped and a further wait for the taxi but by 18:00 we had said our goodbyes to everyone (this all took along time as well) and were back at The B Ranong.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We dropped all our stuff in the room and went straight out to buy drinks for tonight and pay for our transfer to Khao Lak for tomorrow. After much needed hot showers, we started on one of our bottles of Myanmar rum before going out to eat. We returned to The Farmhouse for a few wheat beers and an incredibly spicy meal before going back to the room and finishing the bottle of rum. Not really sure what time we got to bed!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 19th February</span> 
            After breakfast, we were picked up by a taxi for the three hour journey to Khao Lak. We had a few problems finding the hotel but by just after 1:00 we had checked into The Leaf on the Sands Hotel where we will stay for the next two days
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Did not do too much for the rest of the day. We wandered around the area near the hotel buying drinks,etc and also visited the Khao Lak Scuba Adventures office to check on a few things for our next live-aboard. Spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool until the weather turned and we saw our first rain of the holiday.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-12.JPG"></div>            
            <p class="diary-text">We had a few drinks on the balcony in the evening before going out to eat. The place we had eaten in before in Khao Lak had gone but we found somewhere else that had good food and let us drink our own Sang Som. We continued drinking when we got back to the room and got through most of another bottle.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday 20th February</span>
            Unusually for us, we had a day with nothing at all to do today. We were up by 9ish for breakfast and had a couple of hours by the pool before going out for lunch at around 2:00. We went back to the pool after lunch. I went out for a walk to the beach at 3:30 and then we both went out for another walk along the beach when I got back.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The evening was almost exactly the same as yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Wednesday 21st February</span>
            Both felt a bit rough today so went back to bed for an hour after breakfast. We got up at 11ish, sorted out our luggage and checked out by midday. We were not due to be picked up for our next live-aboard until 5:30 so had a few hours to kill. Yesterday while looking for things to photograph here, I discovered that Khao Lak has a turtle sanctuary about five or six miles from where we are staying. We walked along the main road until we found a taxi for the ten minute journey.

            <p class="diary-text">The sanctuary which is run by the Thai Navy was excellent with plenty of turtles of various sizes. Some were there because they are injured but most are just being protected until they are old enough to be released back in The Similans. We had a very enjoyable time wandering round them all and were able to feed cucumber to some of the bigger ones.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The same taxi had waited to take us back into Khao Lak. We had lunch in the same place as the last two days and spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were picked up by Khao Lak Scuba Adventures just before 6:00 and were driven to their offices about half a mile away. We had an hour or so being "checked in" and were then driven to Tab Lamu pier with the other 17 customers and six dive staff. By 20:00, we were on the boat
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">First impression of the boat was that it was a bit small for the number of divers. However, this only really affected the seating/dining area. There is plenty of space on the dive deck and the cabins are air-conditioned and reasonably comfortable.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had a fairly lengthy boat briefing before eating, set up our equipment ready for the first dive tomorrow morning and had a relatively early (and alcohol free) night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Thursday 22nd February</span>
            Everything happens a bit earlier on this boat than it did with Smiling Seahorse. We were woken at 6:00 for the big dive briefing at 6:30. First dive briefing was at 7:00 and we were in the water by 7:26. We were being guided by Rix, a Danish girl and had an American couple, David and Rebecca in our group.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-14.JPG"></div>    
            <p class="diary-text">The first dive was at Koh Bon Bay, a site we have only previously dived at night. David had a few problems getting down at the start of the dive and was low on air after about 40 minutes. By the time we had completed the safety stop the dive time was 48 minutes. Back on the boat, we asked if we could be allowed to stay down on our own at the end of dives. Rix was happy for us to do this but the boat leader would not allow it. Instead we swapped Rebecca and David for Ahmed. This worked out fine as the dive times were 61 and 60 minutes for the next two dives.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Dives 2 and 3 were also at Koh Bon. We did Western Ridge first followed by Northern Ridge. These were just about the same site as one continues from the other. Both were OK without being too spectacular. The area is famous for mantas and if they are not there, the most notable thing about the sites is the dead coral.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The final dive of the day as at Koh Tachai. This was the calmest we have ever seen Tachai. There was hardly any current at all and we could easily swim across to the second pinnacle. This was by far the best dive of the day. Not as many fish as last time we were here (they like the current) but a much nicer site than the ones at Koh Bon had been. For some reason, on this boat, the last dive of the day is only 40 minutes so despite the good conditions, we had to leave the site after 33 minutes with loads of air left. Decided at that point that we would never dive with Khao Lak Scuba Adventures again!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Due to everything happening earlier, we had all finished our evening meal by 7pm. Spent most of the rest of the evening in the cabin.

            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Friday 23rd February</span>
            An even earlier start today for three dives at Richelieu Rock. We had traveled to Richelieu straight after the fourth dive yesterday but there were already a few other boats around when we woke up and we wanted to avoid as many other divers as possible. We had a quick briefing and were in the water by 6:37 for the first dive just as the sun was coming up.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-15.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">Today's diving was incomparable to yesterday's. We did three dives at Richelieu and each one was brilliant. We are still not sure about the dive times and the five minute safety stops but we got a total of almost three hours on the dive site and the whole time down there was superb. We saw a sea-horse and a couple of ghost pipe fish but it was the sheer number of fish around that made the dives impressive. From the millions of glass fish and snapper to the hunting jacks and trevellies, there were fish everywhere you looked throughout the dives. We managed dive times of 61, 57 and 56 minutes which we were reasonably content with after yesterday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">The fourth dive of the day was back at Tachai Pinnacle. This was very similar to yesterday's dive here with the added bonus of a hawksbill turtle at the end of the dive. We had a few minutes with it before having to go up again after 31 minutes of the dive. Had another quiet and early evening when we got back onto the boat.
            </p>

            Another 5:50 wake up on our last day of diving for this trip. First dive was at Koh Bon Pinnacle. It was quite dark when we got in but as the sun came up, it turned into a very nice dive site. Back on the boat, we had our departure briefing after breakfast and started to sort our stuff out for getting back later. I discovered that my laptop screen had broken which was a bit sad..... but does mean that it is time for an upgrade!</p>
            <p class="diary-text">The second and third dives were at the two wrecks near Khao Lak, The Boonsong and the Premchai. Both of these were very good with huge numbers of fish again. The Premchai was the last dive of the day (and of this trip) so was only 40 minutes again but other than that, it was another good days diving.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We were back at Tap Lamu before 4:00 and back in Khao Lak about 30 minutes later. There was a lot of waiting about for our transfer but we were on our way before 5:00 and in Nai Yang just after 6:00. Overall, the trip had been pretty good. We were not happy with some of the dive times, probably because we are used to longer but the amount of diving we did have for the money we paid made it a very good value few days. The diving was not great on the first day but the three dives at Richelieu were superb and made the trip worthwhile. Whether or not we will ever use Khao Lak Scuba Adventures again remains to be seen but we can not have any real complaints. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We had booked a room at the Nai Yang Beach Resort for the last three nights of our holiday. We got an upgraded room unfortunately as they are not as good as the normal rooms but it was still good to be back here. We rewashed all our dive gear before starting on the alcohol again. It was a normal sort of Thai session - a few on the balcony before going to eat at the same restaurant on the beach that we had eaten in last year. We then tried to find somewhere showing the Swansea game. The only bar that would show it was ridiculously expensive so we gave up and found another bar that was showing Liverpool v West Ham. Left there after the football had finished and only vaguely remember getting back to the hotel.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Sunday 25th February</span>
            A couple of days without too much to do to end the holiday. We were quite late getting up due to the amount we had drunk last night. I went for a walk and got my hair cut while Roz went to the pool. We got fried rice and banana shake take-aways for lunch and ate them on our balcony and then both spent the rest of the afternoon at the pool. We had a walk along the beach as the sun was setting before starting to drink again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">It was quite a late start to the drinking but it was the usual routine of beers on the balcony before going out to eat. There did not seem much point moving from our restaurant after we had eaten so drank a second bottle of Sang Som before heading back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Monday 26th February</span>
            Another quiet day. Breakfast, an hour or so by the pool, lunch on the beach and then back to the pool was pretty much all we did all day.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img class="diary-photo" src="images/thailand/thailand-18.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">As we are flying  home tomorrow, we started drinking earlier tonight. We had drinks and nibbles on the balcony before going to eat at Sunset Point, the restaurant we have eaten at the last couple of nights. Excellent food again in a perfect location on the beach. It has become one of our favorite restaurants in Thailand. We returned to the room after eating and finished the end of our Myanmar rum. Probably should have called it a day there but I went out at about 10:30 for a final bottle of Sang Som which we drank most of before going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"><span class="diary-date">Tuesday 27th February</span>
            We were up at 7:00 feeling surprisingly good considering the amount of alcohol we had consumed last night. We had breakfast, checked out by 8:00 and got a transfer to the airport. We were checking in for the 10:20 Bangkok Airways flight to BKK but got put on to an earlier flight. This was delayed meaning that we took off roughly when we were supposed to anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">BKK was all a bit less of a panic than last year and we had about an hour to kill before boarding the 13:05 EVA flight back to Heathrow.
