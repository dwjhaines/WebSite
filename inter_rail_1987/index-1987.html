            Spent 3 hours, 10 minutes hitching from Carmarthen to Theale where I met Dave in a pub. We stayed in Theale until stop tap and then hitched down to Dover. We had to split up on the A2/M25 which meant I got to Dover at 7:10, 40 minutes before him. We met Hugh and Regan in the pub by the station and caught the 10:30 bus to a pub by the docks.

            We bought our tickets and got on the 1am boat to Ostende. The boat pulled out about half an hour late. We spent the journey in the bar - half the time drinking and the rest of the time asleep. We arrived in Ostende as our train to Holland was leaving and had an hour wait until the next one.

            We left Ostende at 7:50 and arrived in Amsterdam at 11:38. After getting rid of our rucksacks and looking for Andy and Roz, we went for lunch - Big Mac and chips. We spent most of the afternoon sitting in bars drinking and smoking the dope Regan had scored earlier. After we were all stoned (except Hugh) we went sight-seeing in the red-light district and then stocked up on food for the journey to Munich. We bought bread rolls, cheese, etc and four bottles of Grolsch each. We left Amsterdam at 18:05 and caught a train to Utrecht where we waited about an hour before getting the 20:00 train direct to Munich.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 26th July</span>
            We arrived in Munich at about 11:50 and spent about an hour trying to lose our rucksacks and to meet Andy and Roz. We walked to the Olympic swimming pool which was closed. We got the U-Bahn back to the station and swapped our swimming stuff for our session stuff.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked from the station to the Mathäser where we had our first steins of the day. After that, we tried to find a beer garden. We could not find one that was open so we went to the Hofbräuhaus. We had three more steins there and we also met Andy and Roz.

            I woke up on the train to Zagreb not really knowing how I had got there. We had two bottles of beer for breakfast. On arrival in Zagreb, we bought more beer and Regan took us all off to find the bus to Bihać (he has been to Plitvice many times and suuposedly knew what he was doing). After a while, we realised that there were trains going to Bihać and quickly boarded one that was about to leave for the three and a half hour journey. Some time later we realised that it was the same train we had just got off! By the time we arrived in Bihać I was out of my mind again.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We waited at a bar in Bihać for the bus to Plitvice. We ended up having to catch two buses and then went about six miles past the campsite we were supposed to be staying at. There was a lot of confusion - not helped by the amount of alcohol that had been consumed. We eventually started hitching and somehow all managed to get lifts to the campsite, except Regan and Hugh who got out of their lift at the wrong campsite and had to walk most of the way!
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            After pitching the tents and showering we bought bread and pate for tea. Everyone else carried on drinking wine until crashing out. I had a bottle of beer as I did not feel like drinking wine.

            <span class="diary-date">Tuesday 28th July</span>
            Spent the day in Plitvice National Park. Regan knew a way that we could all get into the park without paying but we had to pay £7 each when we were inevitably caught by security. Spent the day swimming, walking, looking at waterfalls, etc. We had carp for tea and then caught the bus back to the campsite where we got pissed on two bottles of wine each.

            In the evening we looked at train times for tomorrow. There are no trains from Bihać to Belgrade until 10pm meaning we have over 24 hours until the next train and have effectively wasted a day of the trip.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 29th July</span>
            Woke up with a slight hangover and went for a shower, After packing up and paying camp site fees, we walked the mile to the bus stop where we had a four hour wait for a bus back to Bihać. We arrived in Bihać at 2:30 and had a seven hour wait for a train to Belgrade. We spent the time shopping for food and sitting by a river. We went to a bar for a couple of drinks before catching the 21:56 train.

            The train was packed and for half the journey I tried to sleep in the corridor until I managed to get a seat in a compartment wihtout a window. I only managed to get about two hours sleep due to being cold.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Thursday 30th July</span>
            Arrived in Belgrade at about 6:30 and waited for the 9:35 to Athens. We boarded the train and found seats at about 8:30 but were removed from the seats by 9 because we had not reserved them. The train was packed again and I spent most of the first nine hours standing in the corridor. I eventually got a seat at about 6pm. I fell asleep at about 10 and slept for about 9 hours.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Friday 31st July</span>
            Arrived in Athens at 11 - 2½ hours late. The journey overall could have been worse. We went to a travel agent to buy tickets for the Patras - Brindisi ferry as we have decided to leave Athens straight away. The tickets cost £20 each.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            The train left Athens at 13:10 and was the most crowded one yet. I had to stand for four hours as there was no room to even sit on the floor. By the timme we reached Patras, we had been on trains practically non-stop for 43 hours. We would have been able to break up the journey a lot more if we hadn't cocked up the train times from Bihać. I spent most of the train journey reading whilst standing up.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We boarded the boat for Corfu at 8 and ended up sitting right under the funnel. On the boat, Regan and Hugh got pissed out of their minds on ouzo they had bought earlier. I hadn't bought anything and ended up regretting it. I had forgotten the effect that ouzo had.

             The boat left at 9:30 and Regan and Hugh were both asleep by 10:15. Huw got up again at 11:30 and was sick. At about 2am I moved away from the funnel, which was getting hot, and went to sleep.

            Arrived in Corfu at 8:30 and caught the free bus to Camping Vatos where we met Jeremy, Jason, Hoggy, Wordy and Nick. We went to the beach in the afternoon and then went to Spiros for tea.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked back from Spiros to the campsite bar where me and Jeremy went on rounds of treble ouzos. I don't remember leaving the bar baut apparently I went to Pam Pam's and fell unconscious.

            Woke up with some sort of illness/big hangover. I decided I needed a day off drinking. Paul arrived with Brian at 9. I spent most of the day sleeping in the shade while the others went to the beach.

        <p class="diary-text">
            I hadn't planned to go out in the evening but had my arm twisted and ended up going for tea at the "Rat Taverna". I had Greek salad and chips and about 5 - 6 pints. We played pool and bar football at the Acropolis Bar until 1:30 and then went to Pam Pam's even though I apparently received a life ban last night. We had one of the best nights of the holiday when we got there. We spent about an hour "break dancing" and then requested Bay City Rollers. We must have all looked total idiots but eventually we managed to get some of the other dancers to join in. We returned to the campsite when the disco shut and got drunk on the leftovers of the liqueurs.

            Spent most of the day at the beach. Regan left us for Agios Ionis. In the evening we found a new taverna which was quite solid. We then got pissed at Acropolis and campsite bars before going to Pam Pam's. Jo fell out of a tree.

        <p class="diary-text">
            In the evening we celebrated the start of Brian's birthday by buying him two "Blue Nasties". He headed one of them and sipped the second. Joe had to be carried back from Pam Pam's for the second night running.

        <p class="diary-text">
            <span class="diary-date">Saturday 8th August</span>
            Spent nearly all day at the Acropolis Taverna waiting for the Football League v Rest of the World game which was supposed to be shown on Greek T.V. The game was not on so we got drunk instead. For some reason, we all wore yogurt pots on our heads and after we had eaten, added souvlaki sticks and olives to them. We looked just about as stupid as it is possible to look. In the bar some German bloke bought me and Hoggy a bottle of ouzo. We took this and two others to Pam Pam's where I fell asleep in the shed again.

We picked up Linda, Jo, Paul, Brian and Nick and then took it back again. We spent about an hour by the hotel swimming pool and caught the bus back again. In the evening, I didn't feel like drinking so just had water.

            The last ten days were pretty similar to the previous ten with sessions nearly every day. Most days were exactly the same with the usual routine of beach, evening meal and then general drunkenness in the Acropolis bar, campsite bar and Pam Pam's. Nearly every night Linda or Jo (or both) had to be carried home from Pam Pam's and nearly every night someone was left in the donkey shed.
        </p>
        <p class="other-diary-text">
            The most notable session of the stay in Corfu came on Tuesday, our last night in Camping Vatos. On Monday, me and Dave accompanied Paul, Brian, Linda, Cathy and Jo into Corfu Town as it was their last day. We did not bother to get the last bus home and had to sleep with them in Corfu Town. At 5:30 on Tuesday morning we accompanied Linda, Cathy and Jo to Corfu airport by taxi and at about 6:30 we started on the Metaxa. We left the girls to get their plane at 7:30 and walked back to Corfu Town to get the free campsite bus.

            At about 9:30 we went for breakfast of an omelette and a beer and then bought a bottle of Metaxa between us. We drank this with a bottle of chocolate milk before midday. We had a couple of pints for lunch and then crashed out for about four hours in the afternoon.

            In the evening we were joined by Regan and as usual we had food and got wrecked in Acropolis bar before going back to the campsite bar. Once there, we started to drink tequila  (+ salt and lemon). I only vaguely remember this part of the evening but apparently I had about four of them. By midnight Dave was unconscious so me and Regan had to go to Pam Pam's on our own. I remember being at Pam Pam's and I remember leaving but I have not got a clue what happened there. Regan was back and unconscious before me. Dave woke up in the morning covered in sick after throwing up on himself during the night.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We arrived in Brindisi at about 4:30 and caught a train to Lecce which is where the Brindisi to Innsbruck train originates from. We are on that train at the moment and it is full of noisy little Italians. Dave and I have decided to spend the last four days of our ticket going up to and touring around Scandinavia, ending up in Denmark before hitching home from Copenhagen.

        <p class="diary-text">
            We then decided to go to a beer garden to have a beer each with our remaining German money. When we got there we met Paul and Brian who were on their way home via Munich. They gave us enough money to be able to afford a stein each and then bought us another. By the time we left them at about 8, they were both looking pissed.

            We waited about half an hour for our train, the 9:20 to Copenhagen and then discovered that we would have to change at Hamburg at 6:30 tomorrow morning. We boarded the train and drank the four pints of beer we had bought earlier. Our compartment was empty by midnight so we folded down the seats and had quite a good nights sleep.

We went straight to the Inter Rail Centre and had hot showers, shaves, etc. At about 2 we went out to buy food and beer for the next few days only to discover that all the shops had just closed for the day. This led to a big depression and eventually we decided not to go ahead with our planned tour of Scandinavia. Sweden and Norway are not the ideal places to go if you do not have much money!

            After walking back to the Inter Rail Centre and consulting the timetable we decided to return once again to Munich and Austria and then go home on Monday, the last day of our ticket. We had a mixed salad for tea and then got on the 17:45 for Munich. I slept for the first couple of hours until the boat train when we spent about £7 in the duty free shop. On the train to Hamburg, we drank a litre of wine each which put us nicely to sleep when we boarded the Hamburg - Munich train at about midnight.

            We arrived in Munich at about 9 and after buying food and beer, spent the day on different trains going around the German/Austrian Alps. It was an enjoyable day, admiring the scenery from the train while drinking our beers.

            In the evening when we got back to Munich, we bought two litres of wine each (which we didn't really need!) and boarded the 9:12 train to Ostende. We drank the wine on the train and I remember very little of the holiday after that!

            When we woke up, still drunk from the previous evening, we drank our bottles of beer and Metaxa which we had both planned on saving to take home. I don't remember getting off the train in Ostende or for that matter getting on the boat to Dover. I remember us buying a bottle of Vodka each on the ferry and drinking part of Dave's bottle mixed with orangeade. I don't remember getting off the boat (at about 3) but I woke up in Dover at midnight.

            I slept at the port until 5:30 and decided to start hitching. I spent two hours in the rain before my first lift and eventually got back to Carmarthen at 5pm after eight lifts.
