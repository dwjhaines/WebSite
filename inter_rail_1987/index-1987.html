            Spent 3 hours, 10 minutes hitching from Carmarthen to Theale where I met Dave in a pub. We stayed in Theale until stop tap and then hitched down to Dover. We had to split up on the A2/M25 which meant I got to Dover at 7:10 , 40 minutes before him. We met Hugh and Regan in the pub by the station and caught the 10:30 bus to a pub by the docks.

            We bought our tickets and got on the 1am boat to Ostende. The boat pulled out about half an hour late. We spent the journey in the bar - half the time drinking and the rest of the time asleep. We arrived in Ostende as our train to Holland was leaving and had an hour wait until the next one.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We left Ostende at 7:50 and arrived in Amsterdam at 11:38. After getting rid of our rucksacks and looking for Andy and Roz, we went for lunch - Big Mac and chips. We spent most of the afternoon sitting in bars drinking and smoking the dope Regan had scored earlier. After we were all stoned (except Hugh) we went sight-seeing in the red-light district and then stocked up on food for the journey to Munich. We bought bread rolls, cheese, etc and four bottles of Grolsch each. We left Amsterdam at 18:05 and caught a train to Utrecht where we waited about an hour before getting the 20:00 train direct to Munich.

            We arrived in Munich at about 11:50 and spent about an hour trying to lose our rucksacks and to meet Andy and Roz. We walked to the Olympic swimming pool which was closed. We got the U-Bahn back to the station and swapped our swimming stuff for our session stuff.
        </p>
        <p class="diary-text">
            We walked from the station to the Mathäser where we had our first steins of the day. After that, we tried to find a beer garden. We could notfind one that was open so we went to the Hofbräuhaus. We had three more steins there adn we also met Andy and Roz. We all walked back to the station and then returned to the Mathäser where I fell asleep on the floor after 2 or 3 more steins.
