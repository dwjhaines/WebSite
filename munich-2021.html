            Yet another trip that had been rescheduled many times! It was supposed to be a train journey to Munich via Brussels and Nuremberg in May 2020 with Dave, Hoggy and Ed but after multiple postponements was now a three day trip for just me and Roz.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
            We were awake just after 4am and left Kingsclere 30 minutes later. We left the car with the Meet and Greet at Heathrow and were in Terminal 5 before 6:00. We had breakfast, bought duty free tobacco and were at our gate half an hour before the 6:55 departure to Munich. Plane left on time and was half empty so we had three seats between us for the two hour flight.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We arrived in Munich on time and were on the S-Bahn by about 10:35. We arrived at the Hautbahnhof at 11:16 and had a ten minute walk to Adagio Apartments. We had booked a studio and a one bedroom apartment when there were supposed to be six of us staying here. With all the changes we seemed to have ended up with two one bedroom apartments. We took just one of them and were able to check in straight away. The apartment was very nice with plenty of space for the two of us although would have been  a bit cramped for the other four.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			We dropped off our bags and went straight out to Lidl to buy food for breakfast for the next couple of days. We had a couple of rolls for lunch before heading out for our first beers of the day. We went first to the Augustiner Keller. The beer garden had been changed for the winter with curling areas, shepherds huts, Christmas trees and a mulled wine cabin. All very scenic and festive!

			We went inside the main building. We were keen on visiting the Lagerkeller as I had seen pictures of it and we had not been in it before. Unfortunately it was closed but we got a table in the Bierstüberl and they did let us go down to the Lagerkeller to have a look round and take photos.
        </p>
		<p class="diary-text">
			After a few beers, we walked back to the hotel to collect my driving license and take photos of Roz's passport. The rules on getting into places has changed since we were here two months ago and id is now needed to get in anywhere as well as proof of vaccination. They let us in to the Augustiner Keller with photocopies of passports but we wanted to get something else in case these were not accepted everywhere.

			We went straight out again and went for a few in Augustiner Stammhaus before going to Nürnberger Bratwurst Glöckl am Dom for sausages and a few more beers. By 6:30, we were already quite pissed as we made our way to the Schneider Bräuhaus. We walked through Marienplatz which was a bit sad as it had the stalls set up ready for the Christmas market which was canceled due to the rise in covid cases earlier today. We had a couple of hours in the Schneider Bräuhaus before heading back to the apartment. No recollection of the journey home so don't know if we walked or went on the S-Bahn. Back in bed just after 9.

            After sleeping for about 12 hours, I got up at 9 and went out to get bread for breakfast which we ate in the apartment. We went out for a walk at about 11. We walked through the old town as far as the Hofbräuhaus stopping to buy another Christmas house on the way. We had a look round the Hofbräuhaus before walking back to the apartment via Marienplatz

			After showers, we went out again to start the days drinking. We had decided on a pub crawl that would involve visiting places belonging to each of the big six Munich breweries. First stop was the Paulaner Bräuhaus. We had planned to just have the one drink in there but as we were about to leave, we were offered a taste of their 7% Weissbierbock. We both really liked it so ordered one each so were already feeling light-headed by the time we left there.

			We had a walk of just over a mile to get back to the Augustiner Keller. This time we sat in the main Festaal, an excellent beer hall that we have only been in once before. We had schnitzels and a wheat beer each before moving to the Löwenbräukeller, another excellent beer hall that we have only been in once before. We had a litre and a half in here while watching Swansea v Blackpool on my phone.

			We then had another walk to get us back into the old town and the fourth brewery of the day - Bräustuben Spatenhaus. A few Franziskaners in here and then a short walk to Donisl (big dog pub). We are not usually big fans of this place but it was better than usual tonight and served Hacker-Pschorr beer.

			Our final brewery was Hofbräu so we headed to the Hofbräuhaus to end the night. However we failed to complete the pub crawl as Roz was not allowed in. This was the first place in Munich that had not accepted a photocopy of her passport - they reason. I had already got in with my driving license but no amount of arguing was going to get Roz in. We gave at this point and headed back to the Schneider Bräuhaus. We had good seats in here so stayed for three drinks. We stopped for one more in Augustiner Stammhaus on the way home and got back to the apartment at about 11:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Sunday 21st November</span>
            We left the apartment after a late breakfast just after 11. We walked to the station and bought a Bayern ticket for our trip to Nuremberg and after buying drinks for the journey, got on the 11:44 train.
