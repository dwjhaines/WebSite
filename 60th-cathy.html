              Cathy, Roz and I left Kingsclere at 9am and drove to Basingstoke. We met Dave at the station and all got the 9:44 train up to London. We were joined on the train by Aleks and Andi at Farnborough  and arrived in London just about on time at 10:45. Cathy, Andi & Aleks got the tube to St Pancras while Dave, Roz and myself walked. We were all at St Pancras about half an hour later and met Regan and Hoggy in the Wetherspoons.

              After a couple of drinks and a trip to Marks and Spencer for provisions, we headed into the Eurostar terminal to wait for the 13:01 train to Brussels. This also departed just about on time. It was quite an enjoyable train journey with a few beers and we arrived in Brussels at about 16:00. We had a bit of a dash across the station but managed to get on the 16:26 to Ghent. We arrived in a snowy Ghent by 17:00 and got the tram into the centre. All of us were staying at the B&B except Regan who had booked himself into the Ibis for some reason. We dropped our bags in the rooms and headed straight out to continue drinking.

            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We walked to 't Galgenhuis first but this was fairly full and certainly did not have enough room for eight of us. We continued instead to Het Waterhuis where we were able to get a big table for all of us in the new section. After an enjoyable couple of hours in there and four or five rounds, we headed into the Vridaj Markt stopping at the 't Dreupelkot for a couple of Jenevers on the way. The Dulle Griet was closed - it shuts at 7:30 on a Sunday apparently - so we went straight to the Trollekelder which was open this time. We got tables downstairs and stayed in there until round about midnight. A bit of confusion about how we all got back to the hotel but we all made it with only Hoggy falling over.

              <span class="diary-date">Monday 4th December</span>
              We all met up for breakfast at McDonalds (except Regan) and spent the rest of the morning wandering round Ghent in various groups. We started the days drinking at 1. Once again, there was not enough room for us in 't Galgenhuis so we returned to the same table as yesterday in Het Waterhuis.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We had a few in there before walking across town to the Gruut brewery. We had visited the brewery before but this was the first time we had been to its new location. The plan next was to go to Dulle Griet which was supposed to open at 4:30. We were told there that it was not opening until 6 so we returned to Trollekelder. We got the tables at the front near the windows and spent most of the rest of the day there. We did have another attempt to get into Dulle Griet but it was totally full by the time we got there so we gave up and stayed at the same tables in Trollekelder. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text-gs">
              We finally left Trollekelder at about 10:30 and headed back towards Het Waterhuis. We stopped again at 't Dreupelkot on the way. Things are getting a bit vague by this time. We were refused service in Het Waterhuis as Roz was considered to be too drunk. I took Roz home and did not bother going back out again while the others found somewhere that would serve them.
