              Cathy, Roz and I left Kingsclere at 9am and drove to Basingstoke. We met Dave at the station and all got the 9:44 train up to London. We were joined on the train by Aleks and Andi at Farnborough  and arrived in London just about on time at 10:45. Cathy, Andi & Aleks got the tube to St Pancras while Dave, Roz and myself walked. We were all at St Pancras about half an hour later and met Regan and Hoggy in the Wetherspoons.

              After a couple of drinks and a trip to Marks and Spencer for provisions, we headed into the Eurostar terminal to wait for the 13:01 train to Brussels. This also departed just about on time. It was quite an enjoyable train journey with a few beers and we arrived in Brussels at about 16:00. We had a bit of a dash across the station but managed to get on the 16:26 to Ghent. We arrived in a snowy Ghent by 17:00 and got the tram into the centre. All of us were staying at the B&B except Regan who had booked himself into the Ibis for some reason. We dropped our bags in the rooms and headed straight out to continue drinking.

              We walked to the Gagenhuis first but this was fairly full and certainly did not have enough room for eight of us. We continued instead to Het Waterhuis where we were able to get a big table for all of us in the new section. After an enjoyable couple of hours in there and four or five rounds, we headed into the Vridaj Markt. The Dulle Griet was closed - it shuts at 7:30 on a Sunday apparently - so we went straight to the Trollkelder which was open this time. We got tables downstairs and stayed in there until round about midnight. A bit of confusion about how we all got back to the hotel but we all made it with only Hoggy falling over.
