              Cathy, Roz and I left Kingsclere at 9am and drove to Basingstoke. We met Dave at the station and all got the 9:44 train up to London. We were joined on the train by Aleks and Andi at Farnborough  and arrived in London just about on time at 10:45. Cathy, Andi & Aleks got the tube to St Pancras while Dave, Roz and myself walked. We were all at St Pancras about half an hour later and met Regan and Hoggy in the Wetherspoons.

              After a couple of drinks and a trip to Marks and Spencer for provisions, we headed into the Eurostar terminal to wait for the 13:01 train to Brussels. This also departed just about on time. It was quite an enjoyable train journey with a few beers and we arrived in Brussels at about 16:00. We had a bit of a dash across the station but managed to get on the 16:26 to Ghent. We arrived in a snowy Ghent by 17:00 and got the tram into the centre. All of us were staying at the B&B except Regan who had booked himself into the Ibis for some reason. We dropped our bags in the rooms and headed straight out to continue drinking.

              We walked to 't Galgenhuis first but this was fairly full and certainly did not have enough room for eight of us. We continued instead to Het Waterhuis where we were able to get a big table for all of us in the new section. We were joined during the evening by Ed who had flown out from Manchester. After an enjoyable couple of hours in there and four or five rounds, we headed into the Vridaj Markt stopping at the 't Dreupelkot for a couple of Jenevers on the way. The Dulle Griet was closed - it shuts at 7:30 on a Sunday apparently - so we went straight to the Trollekelder which was open this time. We got tables downstairs and stayed in there until round about midnight. A bit of confusion about how we all got back to the hotel but we all made it with only Hoggy falling over.

              We all met up for breakfast at McDonalds (except Regan) and spent the rest of the morning wandering round Ghent in various groups. We all met up again just after 1pm to begin another days drinking. Once again, there was not enough room for us in 't Galgenhuis so we returned to the same table as yesterday in Het Waterhuis.

              We had a few in there before walking across town to the Gruut brewery. We had visited the brewery before but this was the first time we had been to its new location. This building was not as nice as the original in my opinion but it was OK and we were able to get a big table again. We ended up trying three of their beers, including the 9% Inferno, before moving on. The plan next was to go to Dulle Griet which was supposed to open at 4:30. We were told there that it was not opening until 6 so we returned to Trollekelder. We got the tables at the front near the windows and spent most of the rest of the day there. We did have another attempt to get into Dulle Griet after it had opened but it was totally full by the time we got there so we gave up and went back to Trollekelder.

              We finally left Trollekelder at about 10:30 and headed back towards Het Waterhuis. We stopped again at 't Dreupelkot on the way. Things are getting a bit vague by this time. We were refused service in Het Waterhuis as Roz was considered to be too drunk. I took Roz home and did not bother going back out again while the others found somewhere that would serve them and had one more drink.

              Cathy's 60th birthday! We all met up in reception at 10:00 before walking to Panos. Dave and Hoggy walked directly to the station and I walked after I had eaten. The others got the tram to the station where we all met up again and caught the 10:55 train back to Brussels (all except Regan who wanted to travel home on his own).

              We split up again in Brussels. Aleks, Andi and Dave got off the train at Gare de Midi as they were going home on the Eurostar at 1pm. We said goodbye to Ed at Gare Centrale as he was going off on a tour of Waterloo. The remaining four of us walked from the station to The Bourse. We had booked an apartment for tonight about 10m away. We were there just after midday so could not check in but were able to leave our bags in the bar downstairs and were told to come back in an hour.

              We had planned to go for a bit of a walk round the Christmas market but the weather was worse than it had been since we arrived in Belgium. It was not raining heavily but it was heavy enough to make wandering round in the cold unpleasant. In the absence of anything else we wanted to do, we started drinking again. Quite a few of our usual Brussels bars were closed today. À la Bécasse and Au Bon Vieux Temps were both shut so we went for a couple in A l'Imaige Nostre-Dame.

              We walked back to the where we had left our luggage just after 1 and were given the keys to a huge apartment overlooking The Bourse. We moved our bags into our rooms and went straight back out again. The Toone was also closed as was Au Brasseur so we went into Little Delirium for a couple. After two in there, we crossed the road to one of the Greek restaurants for kebabs (and a Duvel) and then walked down to Poechenellekelder where they had there Christmas beer menu again.

              After a few in there, we went to La Porte Noire for a couple and then visited GIST, a new craft beer place that we had not visited before. Inevitabley things were starting to go downhill a bit by this time. We decided to go back to Poechenellekelder again despite really being too drunk for drinking there. None of us can remember leaving there but we made all went back to the apartment by about 10:30. Roz and Hoggy went to buy four bottles of Delirium Red for some reason and we drank these back in the apartment before going to bed.

              <span class="diary-date">Wednesday 6th December</span>
              A fairly uneventful day spent getting home. We all walked to Gare de Midi after leaving the apartment and had about an hour to wait for the 12:56 train back to London. At St Pancras, Hoggy had an hour or so to wait for his train to Sheffield, Cathy was last seen heading for the underground station to get back to Paddington and Roz & I walked to Waterloo. Today was a strike day so there were no fast trains to Basingstoke, just one slow train an hour. We made the 15:15 train and were back in Basingstoke by 16:40.
