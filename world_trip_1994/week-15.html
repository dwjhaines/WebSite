                We got up at 6 and by 6:30 we were at the bus stop waiting for the 7 o'clock bus to San José. We had been told that the bus sometimes left at 6:30 but today it did not turn up until 7:45. We arrived in San José at about midday and got a taxi into the centre and then ended up checking into two different hotels. We collected our letters from Poste Restante (I got two and Roz got four) but decided to leave the Guatemalan visas until we are in Honduras where they should be easier to obtain.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I went to McDonalds for lunch and I almost had my bag (containing passports, travelers cheques, $200 and my camera) stolen while we ate. We didn't do a lot for the rest of the afternoon. San José did not seem to have a lot to offer.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went to see Dave and Gary, went out to tea together, bought breakfast for tomorrow and then returned to our hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 1st Nov</span>
                We met Dave and Gary at 7 at the bus station and all caught the 7:30 bus to Peñas Blancas at the Nicaraguan border. The border took longer to get through than any other so far. Our passports were seen by eight different officials, three of whom required some sort of payment. We also had to get a bus for the 4km between the two immigration offices. The whole operation took well over an hour and cost us about $4 each.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We finally entered Nicaragua at 1:45 and had a 34 minute wait for a bus to Rivas. At Rivas we got straight onto another bus to San Jorge , 15 minutes away on Lake Nicaragua. Here we had another 40 minutes wait for a boat out to Isla de Ometepe, the largest island on the lake. We arrived in Moyogalpa on the island at 5:30 and checked into a hotel, totally worn out after the days traveling.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out for what could be the first of many traditional Nicaraguan meals. The corrida corriente, the only meal available at most restaurants consists of some form of steak, rice, beans, salad and a bottle of coke.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 2nd Nov</span>
                We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant and then set off on a walk up one of the islands two volcanoes. The walk was quite good but the views were largely spoilt  by the amount of low cloud. Roz and I gave up after an hour or two and were back at the hotel by midday. Dave and Gary kept going to the top and were not seen again until after 5.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I spent the afternoon reading and sleeping in hammocks in the hotel's garden.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out for a comida corriente.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 3rd Nov</span>
                We got up at 6 and walked down to he port where we caught the 6:30 boat back to San Jorge. At San Jorge, there were no buses so we got a share taxi to Rivas.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were not sure where we were heading to when we arrived in Rivas but as the taxi entered the bus station, a Managua bus was just pulling out. We managed to get seats on the bus in positions where we could keep an eye on our rucksacks so got tickets all the way through to Managua. (If we had not been able to watch our luggage or if it was going to be put on the roof, we would have taken another bus even if this meant going to Granada, not Managua)
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the bus station in Managua at 10 and caught a local bus to the area with the cheap accommodation. Managua doesn't have a town centre as it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1972 and has never been rebuilt. This means that the cheap hotels are in a residential area miles away from anything else - not that there seems to be a lot to be miles away from!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking in, we went out for breakfast/lunch - a comida corriente.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the afternoon, we walked to a bank to change money and then went to visit the cathedral which seems to be the only interesting sight in the city. The roof fell off during the 1972 earthquake and has not been replaced although a lot of the building remains intact.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the hotel, we spent about an hour trying to decide what to do for the next few days. We are already ahead of schedule and do not want to get into Honduras until Saturday. We eventually decided to stay in Managua until Sunday and waste a day by getting pissed tomorrow. After all this had been decided, we went to the bank again to get money for the extra day in Nicaragua and for the session.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went out for our second comida corriente of the day.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 4th Nov</span>
                We were all up by 7:30 and set off to see the Masaya volcano. We got a bus to the bus station where we had breakfast - comida corrient with eggs instead of steak. We got a bus at about 8:40 heading for Masaya. Halfway to the volcano, we got off at the Guatemalan embassy to get our visas . On entering the embassy, we were told that British passport holders no longer need visas. This saved us $10 each but it would have been good to have the visas.
            </p>  
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_038.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got another bus to the entrance of the National Park containing the volcano and started on the 7km walk to the summit. Fortunately, after we had walked about 300m, we managed to hitch a lift all the way to the top, saving us quite a hard climb.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The volcano was a lot more spectacular at the top than it had looked from the bottom. It is an active volcano with plenty of smoke and by walking half way round it, we could actually see the lava at the bottom of the crater.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about an hour at the top  and then walked all the way back to the road and returned by bus to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We started drinking at about 4:30. We started with a couple of beers in the hotel and then moved onto the rum and local sugar cane spirit, both of which were very cheap when purchased from the supermarket near the hotel. At 8 we went out for a comida corriente and then went back to the hotel and continued drinking until everyone except Roz fell asleep at around 10:15.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 5th Nov</span>
                Woke at 8ish and listened to the football with hangovers (Crewe 1, Swansea 2). After the results we went out for a comida corriente for breakfast/lunch.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the rest of the day was spent trying to sleep off our hangovers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went to our usual restaurant for another comida corrinte - our eighth in five days. Although repetative, the food has been surprisingly good in Nicaragua.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 6th Nov</span>
                We got up at 4am and got a taxi to the bus station in time for the 5am bus to Ocotal. We got to Ocotal at 9 and had a 15 minute wait for a bus to Los Manos at the border with Honduras. This bus was totally packed with locals with their chickens, etc and took an hour and a half to go 25km.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the border shortly after 11 and spent an hour going around various offices getting our passports stamped, etc, having to pay a total of $8 to various people along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we finally got into Honduras, we got a minibus to El Paraiso, 12km from the border. We had lunch at the bus station and then caught the 1:15 bus to Tegucigalpa, our third capital city in six days. We got a taxi to the hotel recommended in the book and checked in just after 4, twelve hours afater leaving our hotel in Managua.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a couple of hours in the hotel we managed to find a restaurant that did not serve comida corriente and all had pretty good meals for under $2. So far it looks as if Honduras will be one of the cheapest countries we have been to. Bus fares, hotel prices and food have all been less than in other Central American countries.
            </p>
