                We got up at 8ish and after breakfast, we moved to another hotel. The place where we had been staying was OK but the room was very small and did not have a lot of privacy. For Rp2000 a night more we got a much nicer place 200m away.

                We both decided that we would do a one day batik course and at 9 o'clock, we headed off to the Bamboo Workshop. It turned out to be an excellent (and cheap) days entertainment and we were both pleasantly surprised at the standard of work we were able to achieve given our complete lack of artistic talent. We spent most of the day working on our pictures and left them with the paint drying at about 5pm.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we celebrated Roz's birthday a day early by drinking the bottle of brandy that we had bought in Bali. We drank the whole bottle before going out to tea nad do not remember much about the meal.

                After Roz had opened her presents, we went to McDonalds for breakfast. We both had slight hangovers but were sufficiently recovered by about 10 to go and complete the finishing touches to our pictures. We went back to the hotel with the finished product by 11 and went back to sleep for a couple of hours. We didn't do a lot for the rest of the day. We got totally soaked going out to lunch, spent the afternoon in our room and then had a couple of beers before going out to tea. We had another beer with our meal and then had quite an early night.

                We were both awake early and went to breakfast just after 7. We had planned to go and spend a couple of days at a hotel with a swimming pool but after much indecision, we chose to return to the Bamboo Woekshop for a second attempt at batik painting. We had both really enjoyed our first go and will probably never get the chance again so it seemed like a good idea. Once again,, it was a very enjoyable day. We spent the whole day there and will have to return tomorrow to finish the pictures off.

                We booked tickets today to leave Yogya on Friday. We have to reach Jakarta by next Wednesday or Thursday to book tickets for the Pelni ship which leaves for Medan the following Saturday.

                We spent most of the day working on our paintings which took a lot longer to do than our first attempts. We finished at 5pm and once again left with surprisingly good pictures having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves for two days.

                We got up at 6, ate breakfast in our hotel and then waited across the road for our bus. We were heading for Pangandaran and had booked a bus as far as Cilicap. We arrived in Cilicap at 11:45 and were dropped off at the departure point for the backwater boat to Pangandaran. We boarded a boat immediately but sat waiting for it to leave for an hour and a quarter. The journey was similar to the one we made in Kerala. It was not so interesting or spectacular a journey but nevertheless, it was quite an enjoyable way of spending the afternoon.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The journey lastedd four hours and took us to within 17km of Pangandaran. While the other 15 - 20 Western tourists boarded the tourist bus, we set off walking up the road and eventually caught a bemo. We completed the journey by becek and finally arrived at about 5:30. We spent about an hour looking for accommodation. The first place we saw was excellent but at Rp22,500 was more than we usually pay for a room. We looked at several other rooms which were not much cheaper but which were no-where near as nice so after a lot of walking we ended up back where we started.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After much needed showers, we walked back into town for tea.

                At 9am, we set off for the white sand beach in the national park about 2km from where we are staying. The walk was quite pleasant along the beach from our hotel and then through the jungle of the national park with its monkeys and other wildlife. The beach was not as good as expected and the water was not deep enough of swimming but we spent a couple of hours sun-bathing anyway. The monkeys from the jungle came right up to us on the beach which was OK until one of them scratched Roz in an attempt to steal our water bottle.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                After leaving the beach, we tried to find the swimming pool and waterfall but failed due to the lack of detail on our map. We gave up and walked back to our hotel where we ate pot noodles (Pop Mie) for lunch. Our room had a colour TV and we were able to spend half the afternoon watching highlights of the European Championship games from December. We then walked into town to find out the prices of bus tickets for when we continue our journey towards Jakarta sometime next week. After tea, we watched Man City v Man United back in our room

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 12th Feb</span>
                We spent a couple of hours on the beach in the morning. The beach which is opposite our hotel is quite nice but the "No Swimming" sign is a bit off-putting. We decided that there was not enough to keep us here another day so after lunch, we booked ourselves onto tomorrow's bus to Bogor on the outskirts of Jakarta.
