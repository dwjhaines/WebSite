                The morning was spent lying around in the hammocks not doing a lot. We had booked tickets for the 1:00 La Paz bus though we intended stopping at Caranavi where we would stay before continuing to Coroico in the morning.
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus journey was pretty uneventful and we arrived in Caranavi at 10:00 and checked into a hotel right by the bus station.

                We had expected to get a bus and be in Coroico within a couple of hours. After breakfast at 7:30 we were directed to the "Tranca" at the edge of town and told to wait for a lift with a lorry. We waited for a couple of hours by which time, Roz was starting to feel the symptoms of the bug that I had just had. (by now I was almost fully recovered). Eventually the 10:30 bus came along, totally packed and after an argument with the driver we pushed our way on and stood in the corridor for the whole trip. The journey took about 3.5 hours including the lunch stop. The bus took us to Yolasa from where we got a lift in a pick-up truck up to Coroico and we finally managed to get ourselves into the Hotel Esmereldas which had been widely recommended at about 3:15. The hotel was the best we have stayed in so far and was pretty good value at about 25Bs each. Definitely the best showers in Bolivia.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went for a short walk around town and then ate at a superb restaurant. Just as we were getting bored of the dry Bolivian food, this place produced excellent spaghetti bolognese and huge prtions of milenesa de neopolitana with chips (breaded meat in spicy tomato sauce). Roz by now had totally got my bug and was sick during and after the meal.

                Another day spent not doing a lot. Dave, Ed, Gary and I went for a 7 - 8 mile walk in the morning. Roz was still not well though was showing signs of recovery by the afternoon.

                We got up just after 7 and after a final hot shower, we headed down the hill to the main plaza, stopping for breakfast along the way. We had booked seats in a mini-bus going back to La Paz which left at 10:30. The journey took just less than four hours and did not seem as frightening as it had done in the bus going the other way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 3pm we were back in the Hostal Republica where we had stayed on our last stay in La Paz. We had a picnic lunch and spent the rest of the  afternoon sorting out travelers cheques, bus tickets, etc and I bought a much needed pair of trousers. In the evening we returned to the chicken restaurant we had eaten in last time we were here and then had an early night.

                We woke at 6:30, packed and checked out of the hotel and at 7:15 we were picked up by the tour company that was taking us to Copacobana and eventually Puno in Peru. We were taken to the tour company office where we changed buses - thankfully to a full size bus, not the mini-bus I had expected. The bus journey was quite enjoyable and included a ferry journey. We arrived in Copacobana at 12:00 and checked into a hotel - the cheapest yet at 7B each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a walk around the town and visited the cathedral before returning to the hotel. Spent the rest of the afternoon sitting in the sun or lying on the beds when it got cold. We went out for a meal of Lake Titicaca trout in the evening and were all in bed by 9 due to the cold weather.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 27th Aug</span>
                We caught a boat at 8am which took us out to Isla Del Sol which is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the area. We arrived at the island at 9:30 and after a quick look round, we decided to head back to the mainland. We agreed a price with the owner of another boat and he took us to Yampupata, about 10 miles from Copacabana.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about five hours walking back stopping for the football results along the way (Swansea 0, Birmingham 2)
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We were totally knackered by the time we got back so, after a lunch of corned beef and sardine sandwiches we all slept for the rest of the afternoon. We ate at the same place as yesterday and had another early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 28th Aug</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at 10:30 and went to sit in the restaurant where we had eaten the last two nights. We had three hours to kill before we had to get on the bus to Puno and we spent the time playing cards, eating and going out to buy souvenirs. Our bus left just after 2 and we crossed the border into Peru about 20 minutes later.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Puno at 4:35 and found that the bus to Cuzco that we wanted to catch left at 5. We got a taxi across Puno to the bus station and, after a bit of a scramble at the ticket office, managed to get the last five seats on the bus at exactly 5 o'clock.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus left about ten minutes late and the journey was to prove to be one of the least comfortable we have ever been on. The bus was old and kept breaking down and most of the padding had been removed from the seats enabling an assortment of metal bars to stick into your back for the whole journey. The road was terrible and the bus's aging suspension combined with the fact that we were sat near the back made sleep just about impossible.
