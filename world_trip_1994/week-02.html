                We got up at 6:00 and discovered that breakfast - bread and jam - was included in the price of our rooms. We walked to the bus station and caught our bus to Ciudad del Est, the nearest town in Paraguay to The Iguazu Falls. By about 1pm, we had checked into a hotel, had lunch and set off to see the falls. We walked down to the bridge that forms the border between Paraguay and Brazil and caught a local bus to Foz de Iguaza on the Brazilian side of the bridge. When we got to the bus terminal at Foz de Iguaza there did not seem to be a lot happening and we worked out that we probably had an hour and a half wait for a bus to the falls. We instead opted for a taxi that charged us $30 to take us to the falls, wait two hours and then bring us back
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text"> 
                The falls were excellent. The first view of them was as spectacular as expected and the views improved the closer to the water we got. The walkways meant that you could walk right out into the middle of some of the falls getting totally soaked in the process. All in all, one of the most spectacular places I have ever been.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After one and a half hours of walking around, taking photos, etc, we got back to the taxi and returned to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went out for tea, a pretty poor piece of chicken each and all had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 2nd Aug</span>
                We had decided last night that we would stay in Ciudad del Est a second night and leave tomorrow for Ascencion. We got up at 7:00, had a couple of empanadas again for breakfast and walked down the road to the bridge going across to Brazil. From here, we got a bus that took us through Foz and on into Argentina and Puerto Iguazo. Another bus took us back to the falls, this time on the Argentinian side. We had all overestimated the weather. Yesterday was hot and sunny and we had all come today in shorts and t-shirts (except Dave). By the time we arrived at the falls, it was freezing cold and just starting to rain. We decided to walk round and see the falls anyway and in the end, the weather didn't really spoil our enjoyment. The falls were just as good on the Argentinian side as they had been yesterday and we spent a couple of hours walking round the various walkways and paths.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the end we had to leave due to the bad weather and our lack of proper clothes. We got a couple of buses that got us back to the Brazilian side of the bridge from where we could walk into Paraguay and back to our hotel. After putting on warm clothes, we went out for lunch then spent the afternoon reading or playing cards. Roz and I went to the bus station to get tickets for tomorrow's trip to Ascencion and after tea (more empanadas) we had another early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 3rd Aug</span>
                Got up at 6, walked to the bus station and had our empanadas again for breakfast. Our bus left at 7:20 and we soon discovered why the bus company we were with was so much cheaper than all the others. The bus seemed to stop every 100m and the journey which should have taken four hours took six. We arrived in Ascencion at 1:30 and there followed a lot of confusion as to what we should do next. We wanted to go straight to Resistencia in Argentina about six hours away. We decided to get the next bus which was at 2:00but by the time we had reached this decision, the bus was full. After more discussion, we decided to get the midnight bus and spend the rest of the day in Ascencion. To save our dollars, Roz and I caught a bus into the centre and changed travelers cheques into Guranys to pay for the tickets. By the time we returned to the bus station (about 2 hours later) the price had come down and we were left with a surplus of Paraguayan money.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were all starving by this point so we left our luggage and went back into the centre to look for something to eat. All the restaurants we found were either closed or too expensive but after about an hour of wandering around we found a German type bar which did hamburgers, chips, etc. We managed to get through our surplus Guranys and left the bar quite pissed at around 10pm. We caught a bus back to the terminal, changed another $20 for a couple more beers in a bar across the road and eventually staggered onto the bus just before it left at midnight. (we were told at the bus station that Gary's $20 notes were forgeries and the cambio refused to accept them) We had our first customs check at about 12:30 and all had to get off the bus with our luggage which was searched but not very thoroughly. Eventually got to sleep by about 1.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 4th Aug</span>
                We arrived at Resistencia just over four hours later at 6:15 Argentina time. We wanted to keep on traveling and get a bus across Northern Argentina to Salta or Jujuy. There was only one bus a day to both places at 5pm to Jujuy and 6pm to Salta. We decided on the earlier of the two and booked five tickets on the 5pm bus costing $43 each. This meant nearly 11 hours to kill in Resistencia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Resistencia was quite a pleasant town but there was not a lot to do and also it was the most expensive place we had been to so far. We had breakfast in a cafe by the bus station and then, when the weather was a lot warmer, we went out and sat in a park.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Despite having nothing to do all day, we managed to wait until the banks had closed before realising that we were totally out of Pesos. We managed to buy lunch with dollars but after that we were left with a box of biscuits and a bottle of water for the overnight bus journey to Jujuy. The day went quite quickly and the bus left on time at 5.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 5th Aug</span>
                Arrived in Jujuy at 6:45 to find that the weather had already got decidedly colder. It was also pitch dark and we still had no Pesos. We walked into the centre of town (about 10 minutes away) and within about half an hour had booked ourselves into the Residencia Belgrano. We changed money and went out for breakfast. Thankfully, food seemed to cost about one third of the price it had done in Resistencia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the morning doing our washing, shopping, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch we headed out to Termal de Reyes, a hotel about 15 miles away up in the mountains with a naturally heated thermal swimming pool. We spent the afternoon lazing around in the pool while admiring the scenery.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 6th Aug</span>
                Today we started heading Northwards into the foothills of the Andes. In Jujuy we were already 1000m above sea-level and we had decided to head for Humahuaca, 126km away which is about 3000m above sea-level. The bus trip was about four hours in total but we decided to break the journey up by stopping at Maimara and Tilcara along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The scenery as we traveled up the valley from Jujuy was excellent with huge multicoloured mountains on both sides of the road. The recommended sights at both our stopping points were not that interesting but the surrounding views made the stops worthwhile. We had lunch in Tilcara and arrived in Humahuaca at about 3. Humahuaca is only a small town but is much more like the real South America we have come to see than the cities and towns we have been staying in. It also provided us with probably the cheapest and best accommodation we ahve had so far.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The food over the last two days has also been excellent. Since leaving Resistencia, just about everywhere we have been, we have been able to get lomitos - steak sandwiches with egg, cheese, ham and salad - for about $1.50.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The temperature in the evenings has dropped dramatically since we started climbing. It is still hot and sunny during the day but as soon as the sun goes down it becomes freezing cold (2°c in the mornings).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the day playing cards, eating and trying - unsuccessfully - to buy tickets for tomorrow morning's bus to La Quiaca at the Bolivian border.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 7th Aug</span>
                We got up at 8 and walked around the corner to the bus station. It was totally deserted when we arrived but the bus we were hoping to catch turned up by 8:45 and we got on it without any problems.The journey took about three and a half hours and once again, the scenery was very spectacular. On reaching La Quiaca we had a mile walk to the border where the crossing was very straightforward but quite time consuming.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had changed money (Gary's $20 notes were rejected again) and all of us had had something to eat we attempted to get a bus to Tupiza, about two hours away. At the bus terminal, we managed to buy tickets immedeatley but could not get on the bus because a fat semi-conscious Bolivian was laid out on the front seats vomiting on the floor. "He's probably the driver" I said. Sure enough, ten minutes after they had cleared up the mess and we had taken our seats it became apparent that he was our driver and he was not the most sober person in the world. There was a lot of confusion but eventually everyone, including a policeman who had joined in the discussion seemed to think he was OK to drive the bus. The driver splashed himself with water, wiped the vomit from his face and shirt, combed his hair and climbed confidently into the driver's seat. We had already paid for our tickets so decided to stay on the bus and see what happened.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_007.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had driven round the town, clipping the pavement along the way, and were speeding Northwards along the un-tarmaced roads we were starting to wonder if we had made the right decision. Luckily, about a mile out of town there was a police checkpoint where the driver was taken off the bus, arrested and taken back towards Villazon. The police then suggested that the bus conductor/ticket collector, a lad of no more than 20, should drive the bus the rest of the way. He had a go but when it became obvious that he could not drive a bus, the police got someone from another office next to the checkpoint to drive the bus into the town. This bloke was eventually persuaded to drive the bus all the way and, an hour after our original departure, we set off again at a more sedate pace.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually arrived at Tupiza at 6pm after yet another scenic journey. We checked into a hotel, went out for tea and had an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have only just entered Bolivia but it seems like another world compared to Argentina. The buses in Argentina were well organised, easy to book and ran exactly on time.The bus stations we have seen so far in Bolivia have been totally chaotic and the roads have also deteriorated dramatically. The standards of hygiene have also gone down hill and the restaurant toilets we saw at lunchtime were every bit as disgusting as the Lonely Planet description.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Prices have also dropped. At lunch time, Roz and I had a four course meal for $1 each. We were told that it cost $1 when we asked the price of the soup but they kept bringing us extra courses. The hotel prices have dropped as well - $2 each tonight instead of the usual $7 or $8.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We have decided to stay a couple of nights in Tupiza and recover from all the traveling we have been doing recently.
