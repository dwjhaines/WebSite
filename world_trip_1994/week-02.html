                We got up at 6:00 and discovered that breakfast - bread and jam - was included in the price of our rooms. We walked to the bus station and caught our bus to Ciudad del Est, the nearest town in Paraguay to The Iguazu Falls. By about 1pm, we had checked into a hotel, had lunch and set off to see the falls. WE walked down to the bridge that forms the border between Paraguay and Brazil and caught a local bus to Foz de Iguaza on the Brazilian side of the bridge. When we got to the bus terminal at Foz de Iguaza there did not seem to be a lot happening and we worked out that we probably had an hour and a half wait for a bus to the falls. We instead opted for a taxi that charged us $30 to take us to the falls, wait two hours and then bring us back

            <p class="diary-text"> 
                The falls were excellent. The first view of them was as spectacular as expectedand the views improved the closer to the water we got. The walkways meant that you could walk right out into the middle of some of the fallsgetting totally soaked in the process. All in all, one of the most spectacular places I have ever been.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After one and a half hours of walking around, taking photos, etc, we got back to the taxi and returned to the hotel.

                In the evening, we went out for tea, a pretty poor piece of chicken each and all had an early night.

                We had decided last night that we would stay in Ciudad del Est a second night and leave tomorrow for Ascencion. We got up at 7:00, had a couple of empanadas again for breakfast and walked down the road to the bridge going across to Brazil. From here, we got a bus that took us through Foz and on into Argentina and Puerto Iguazo. Another bus took us back to the falls, this time on the Argentinian side. We had all overestimated the weather. Yesterday was hot and sunnny and we had all come today in shorts and t-shirts (except Dave). By the time we arrived at the falls, it was freezing cold and just starting to rain. We decided to walk round and see the falls anyway and in the end, the weather didn't really spoil our enjoyment. The falls were just as good on the Argentinian side as they had been yesterday and we spent a couple of hours walking round the various walkways and paths.

                In the end we had to leave due to the bad weather and our lack of proper clothes. We got a couple of buses that got us back tothe Brazilian side of the bridge from where we could walk into Paraguay and back to our hotel. After putting on warm clothe, we went out for lunch then spent the afternoon reading or playing cards. Roz and I went to the bus station to get tickets for tomorrow's trip to Ascencion and after tea (more empanadas) we had another early night.
