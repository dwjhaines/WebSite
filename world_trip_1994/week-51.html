                We got up at 6:30, packed and caught a dolmus into Bodrum. We walked from the bus station down to the port where we ate breakfast and waited for the 9 o'clock boat to Datça. We arrived in Datça at 11:30 and checked into a room at the Tuna Pansiyon where we had stayed three years ago. We wandered round the shops and looked around the harbour before having a kebab for lunch and spending the afternoon on the beach. In the evening, we ate out at one of the restaurants ovelokking the harbour.

                Another day of not doing a lot. We got drunk in the evening mainly on bottles of cheap Turkish wine but we also had a few beers in a bar near the harbour.

                Spent most of the day recovering from last night but did make it down to the beach by about 3 in the afternoon.

                We got up before 8 and, after eating breakfast, we headed down to the harbour to try and get on a boat trip for the day. We had planned to do the "12 Island" boat tour from Fethiye but as we do not now intend going that far East, we decided to do a day trip from here instead. We asked about a few trips and eventually settled for one going out to the ruins at Knidos. We chose this one because it was cheap and we liked the captain as opposed to any great desire to see the ruins! The boat left the harbour at 9:30 and we were away for a total of nine and a half hours. This time included four stops, one at the ruins, one because we ran out of fuel , one for lunch and finally a stop at a beach for half an hour of swimming.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The stop at the ruins themselves was pretty uninteresting. The ruins did not look particularly exciting and Roz and I didn't bother spending the 7op each it would have cost to enter the site. Running out of fuel meant that we were stuck out at sea for about 45 minutrs while the captain radioed for a boat to bring out a tank of diesel.

            <p class="diary-text">
                The lunch stop was excellent. We ate in a nice restaurant and were given time to go swimming before getting back on the boat. the final stop was also very good. The boat moored in a small bay with beautifully clear water and we had half an hour or so of diving in from the boat  and generally swimming around. All in all it was an excellent day out and good value at £7.

                We had a session in the evening, almost an exact repeat of the one at Wednesday.
