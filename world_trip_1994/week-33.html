                Roz and I got up early and went to the post office in the hope that it would open at 8. Luckily it did so we had time to collect our mail, dash back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and then all proceeded to the bus station by 8:30. We had not booked tickets for the 9am bus and were fortunate to all get on the bus - only getting tickets at 8:55 when some passengers failed to turn up. The bus was air-conditioned so the journey was far easier than some we have been on during the last couple of months.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Tanah Rata in the Cameron Highlands at 1:30 and were driven from the bus station to an excellent hotel near to the one recommended by Regan.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for a walk around the town and then another on one of the jungle paths. The second one took us around scenic lookout points and to The Smoke House Hotel and lasted about two hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the afternoon we phoned Cathy and discovered that she will not be flying out to Thailand to meet us next week due to a bad back. Dave is also not going to be there as he has no money and has extended his visa to stay in Australia.

                We went for a walk of about four or five miles before lunch. The walk was quite enjoyable though the views along the way were not as good as we had expected them to be. Most of the afternoon was spent reading and generally lazing around in the hotel garden.

                We caught the 9:30 bus from Tanah Rata all the way to Georgetown, on Penang. Once again, the bus was air-conditioned and the six and a half hour journey was not too bad. We checked into The Swiss Hotel and then Roz and I walked to the post office to collect our second lot of post this week. In the evening we returned to the same place where we used to eat when we were here five years ago.

                After stuffing our faces with roti canai we walked to the Comtar shopping centre to try and buy  malaria tablets. We spent about half an hour before giving up and then the three of us got a bus out to see the Kek Lok Si Temple. The temple was fairly interesting and also had excellent views overlooking most of Georgetown. No-one was particularly bothered about seeing the rest of the sights in Penang so we had another afternoon of lying around not doing a lot. Earlier in the day we booked ourselves on a bus which will take us all the way to Koh Samui in about 13 hours for about Â£6.50. This was far less than we had expected it to cost and worked out about the same as if we did the journey by public bus and ferry.

                The journey to Samui took 15 hours starting at 4:15am. We were taken by air-con mini-bus from our hotel to Hat Yai, just the other side of the Thai border. There we were transferred to another mini-bus which took us to Surat Thani where we arrived at 1:15pm. At 2pm another bus took us out to a port where we got the "express" boat out to Samui. We caught a bemo type bus to Lamai and got off at Palm Bungalows where we should meet Regan in a few days time. We got ourselves a really good bungalow for B150 and ate our evening meal in the restaurant. We also tried a bottle of Mekong for the first time.

                Spent most of the day on the beach which is excellent and about two minutes walk from our bungalow.

                In the evening, we had Regan's "arrival session" despite the fact that he has yet to appear. We drank a couple of large bottles of Mekong while playing cards on our balcony. By the time we had finished these, we were all pretty pissed and only vaguely remember tea which we ate in the hotel restaurant with another half bottle. We then got a pick-up truck into Lamai where we watched Liverpool v Spurs on the tele. None of us remember a lot about the game or how we got back from Lamai.

                Another day dominated mainly by hangovers. Hoggy and Roz suffered the most and were both sick frequently throughout the day. Regan turned up on his two week holiday at lunchtime and got himself a bungalow near ours. In the evening he took us to Pong's restaurant for an excellent meal followed by our first taste of Thai grass in the garden. Hoggy and Regan went back into Lamai for another Mekong session. Roz and I had an early night.
