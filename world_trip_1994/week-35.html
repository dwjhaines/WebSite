                We left the bungalow just before 9 and had a half hour wait for the pick-up truck which took us to Big Buddha Beach from where we caught the boat over to Ko Phangan. We arrived at Phanghan at about midday and walked to Neptune's bungalows about five minutes away from the ferry jetty.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the afternoon on a beach about 20 minutes walk away from where we are staying.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After eating in the evening, we spent a few hours in a bar drinking cups of tea and smoking the local grass.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 21st Mar</span>
                We spent most of the day on "Party Beach" which all of us except Regan thought was a lot better than the one we went to yesterday.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went to an Indian restaurant for tea and then went back to the same bar we had spent yesterday evening in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 22nd Mar</span>
                The weather was pretty bad when we woke up so Roz, Hoggy and I decided to return to Koh Samui on the afternoon boat. Regan met up with a friend and is staying an extra night to go to an all night acid party.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The three of us got the 2:30 boat, arrived at Big Buddha by 3:30 and half an hour later were back at Palm Bungalows at Lamai. We were all pretty worn out after the last couple of days so after eating we had an early night.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 23rd Mar</span>
                After a couple of hours on the beach, Roz and I caught the bus into Na Thon as she was leaving for Bangkok to spend four days with her mum. We did some shopping, had lunch and she also booked her train ticket for coming back to Samui next Monday night.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz caught the 2:30 boat across to Surat Thani and I got the bus back to Lamai. By the time I got back, Regan had reappeared but he was in no fit state for doing anything until later in the evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After eating tea, we walked into Lamai and did the usual tour of Lugano's, Blues Bar, Mix Pub, and ended up in Bauhaus though by this stage of the evening no-one remembers anything too clearly. We all managed to walk back on our own and Hoggy, unable to get into our bungalow climbed into Regan's through a window and slept the night there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 24th Mar</span>
                Spent just about the whole day recovering from last night and hardly left the room. The evening was just about a repeat of last night except for the fact that Regan was drinking beer so was more sober than Hoggy and I were. I vaguely remember getting a taxi home.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th Mar</span>
                I spent another day lying on my bed recovering. Regan and Hoggy left at about midday - Regan to fly home via Bangkok and Hoggy to travel up to Chang Mai, also via Bangkok.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                I got up by about 4:30pm by which time I could not be bothered to think about moving to cheaper accommodation (our bungalow costs B150 regardless of how many people are in it).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening I watched the videos while eating tea in the restaurant. I had planned to walk into Lamai to watch the football at Bauhaus but could not be bothered so listened to the sport on World Service for three hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 26th Mar</span>
                A quiet day spent reading and lying around on the beach. Roz phoned in the evening to confirm that she has changed our flights so that we will stay in Thailand until 8/4/95. At 9, I walked into Lamai to watch the Brazilian Grand Prix at Bauhaus Pub. After sitting there for an hour it had still not come on so I gave up and walked back for an early night.
