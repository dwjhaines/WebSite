                We woke at 7:30 to discover that Ed had been sick on Dave's newly washed coat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel at 8:30 and, after breakfast, caught a taxi to the airport. The airport seemed pretty dis-organised but we eventually got onto our plane at 11 and it took off almost immediately despite being ten minutes early. We stopped in Juliacca and got to Araquipa at 12:30, earlier than expected. We got a taxi into town with Heather who had been on our Inca Trail tour. She stayed in a hotel in the centre while we walked out a little way to a slightly more expensive place with gardens to lounge around in.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, we all spent the afternoon asleep recovering from slight hangovers. In the evening we spent a couple of hours sorting out bus tickets for Wednesday and a tour of Colca Canyon for tomorrow, had a half chicken and chips for tea and then had an early night.

                The tour started at 4am and we were collected from the hotel at 3:45. The day seemed to consist mainly of sitting in a hot, dusty mini-bus. We had a stop for breakfast and did not reach the main viewing point until about 10. We saw some condors which the canyon is famous for but they were so far away, it was impossible to get any sort of view of them.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The canyon itself was OK but not truly spectacular. It was not as good as we had been led to believe by Lonely Planet and certainly nothing like the Grand Canyon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had about 45 minutes looking at the canyon and the bus then drove along the rim stopping at a few not very interesting villages along the way. We had a 30 minute stop at a thermal swimming pool - the highlight of the day - and then, after lunch drove back to Araquipa. We were held up on the way back by a crane that was trying to recover a lorry that had gone over a cliff and we eventually got back just before 8. Altogether we had been away for 16 hours, at least 12 of which had been spent on the bus.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 7th Sept</span>
                We got up quite early and Dave, Roz and I walked into the town centre to change travelers cheques and buy breakfast. I also picked up a course of antibiotics for a sore throat that I have had for the last five days. We spent the day lazing around, initially in the hotel bedrooms and, after we had checked out, in the hotel gardens which were very pleasant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 7pm we got a taxi to the bus terminal and caught the 8 o'clock bus to Nazca
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th Sept</span>
                The bus journey was quite a good one compared with what we have become used to. The bus itself was the best we have been on for a while , the road was surfaced all the way and we arrived in Nazca earlier than expected at 5:30 am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked into the Hotel Alegria, had a good breakfast and then had a couple of hours sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 11 we went on a tour consisting of a trip to see a video of the Nazca Lines, a visit to a Nazca cemetery and a stop at a pottery factory/shop.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_023.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The video was quite interesting although Dave obviously didn't think so as it put him off doing a flight over the lines. The cemetery was excellent. We were driven out to the middle of a dessert littered with thousands of bones and skulls from about 1000 years ago. We spent about 30 minutes walking around, picking up bits of bone and skulls and taking photos. The pottery shop was not too exciting. We arrived back at Nazca at 2 and Roz, Ed and I booked ourselves on a flight over the lines tomorrow morning ($55 each).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the day reading, writing letters and generally lazing around.

                Roz, Ed and I were all up by 7 and we were taken with another couple by taxi to the air field 3km away. The flight was in a six-seater plane and lasted about 35 minutes. The views of the lines were excellent and all the shapes and patterns could be made out clearly. The lines can only be seen from the air and the fact that they were made so long before planes made them even more fascinating.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 8am, we were back at the hotel. At 10 we checked out and got on a minibus heading for Ica (2.5 hours away). At Ica we got on another bus to Pisco where we arrived at 1:30. We checked into a hotel, had lunch and booked ourselves onto a tour for tomorrow, visiting the area's sea-lion colonies, etc. The rest of the afternoon was spent reading the Lonely Planet books trying to work out plans for the next few weeks. We had planned to fly from Quito to Panama City but now look certain to travel to Panama via Columbia. Despite its bad reputation, people have constantly recommended Columbia to us and it does seem to have several places worth visiting. Also it looks as if we will spend a lot less time than planned in Mexico at the end of the trip due to it being more expensive than the other countries in the area so we could do with spending an extra couple of weeks in South America.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 10th Sept</span>
                We got up at 6:30, had breakfast and by 7:30 were on a tour bus heading for Paracas. From here, we got a boat which spent a couple of hours going out to Islas Ballestas, famous for its bird and sea-lion colonies (known as the poor man's Galapagas). The wildlife was very impressive. We saw hundreds of seals and sea-lions as well as masses of large sea birds including pelicans, terns and boobies (which kept Gary amused for most of the trip). We also saw penguins and flamingos though these were quite a way from us and were not as spectacular. The trip did not go on for too long as some tend to and we were back on the mainland in time for the football results (Swansea 0, Bradford 0). We were back in Pisco by 11:15 and after a lie down and lunch, the afternoon was spent in much the same way as the previous two.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 11th Sept</span>
                We caught the 8:30 bus to Lima where we arrived four hours later. Lima looked a horrible place and the first thing we did when we arrived at the bus station was to book tickets to Tumbes for tomorrow lunchtime. We got a taxi to the hotel recommended in the book, checked in and went for lunch at a near-by restaurant. We didn't really want to go out of the hotel in the afternoon - the city looked unsafe and unpleasant - so we spent about five hours lying around and playing cards. The only reason we have stayed in Lima at all is to collect Roz and Gary's stolen travelers cheques which we must do tomorrow and then head North on a 24 hour bus journey to Tumbes where we cross into Equador. We ate tea at the same place that we had eaten lunch but apart from that, did not leave the room all day.
