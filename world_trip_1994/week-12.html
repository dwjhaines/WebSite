                We got up at 8ish and ate the remains of last nights pizza for breakfast. We changed $20 to give us enough money to pay for the hotel and then went on a final shopping trip buying t-shirts and more second hand books.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 11:30 we checked out of the hotel and got a taxi to the airport. We were not sure if we were going to be allowed on the flight to Panama as we do not possess onward tickets and were uncertain of the entry requirements. We had a worrying moment as we checked in when we were asked whether or not we had onward tickets. We explained that we had tickets from LA in December and after we had shown these tickets, much to our relief we were allowed on the flight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Cartagena (and South America) at 2:15, stopped en route at Barranquilla and arrived in Panama City at 4pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Immigration and customs were very efficient and the fact that we had only half filled in the mountain of paperwork we had been given didn't seem to bother anyone. Our rucksacks were the first ones on the conveyor belt and by 4:10 we were walking out of the airport towards the bus stop.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus straight away. The airport is 25km out of town and the journey took over an hour. However, at 30c each it was considerably cheaper than a taxi ($28). From where the bus dropped us, we started walking towards the area with cheap accommodation but eventually gave up and got a taxi.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The hotel is pretty good at $3 a night each however, it is in an area where it is unsafe to go out at night. We got a taxi to a restaurant recommended in the book and had excellent spaghetti for tea.
            </p>

                We left the hotel at 8ish and first walked to the post office to check for letters in poste restante. As expected, there was nothing there. We walked to the bus station to check bus times to David for tomorrow and then caught a bus to the banking area of the city to change travellers cheques. I took less cheques than I had meant to so went back to the hotel and then returned to the bank to cash more. By the time I had sorted out the money, it was getting on for 11:00. We went into the nearest McDonalds (our first since Buenos Aires) and had double Big Mac meals.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus back to the centre and then another which dropped us about a mile from the Miraflores Locks on the Panama Canal. The locks were not as impressive as I had expected them to be when we first arrived but became far more interesting when ships started going through them and we ended up staying there for over two hours. There were seating areas for watching the ships with commentary and information in English. It was all excellently done and didn't cost anything to get in. At 3 we caught the bus back to the city and walked back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 12th Oct</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at 7:30 and walked to the bus station stopping for breakfast along the way.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught the 9:00 bus to David. The bus was air-conditioned and comfortable and the six and a half hour journey went quite quickly. We checked into a hotel and went out to find the tourist information office to try and get info about Boco Del Torres where we are heading for tomorrow. The office had long since closed down so we got something to eat and returned to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th Oct</span>
                We got up, had breakfast and then walked to the bus station where we got straight onto a bus to Chiriquí Grande. We arrived there at 11:05 hoping to catch the 1 o'clock ferry. We went to the ferry office and discovered that the timetable had changed  and we had missed the boat by five minutes. We thought at this point that we might have to wait nearly 24 hours in Chiriquí Grande but eventually managed to get on a speed boat to Almirante for $10 and then paid another $2 to be taken to Bocas del Toro. This all worked out three times as expensive as the ferry would have done but seemed a better option than wasting a whole day.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Bocas del Toro at 2:30 and spent an hour looking for somewhere to stay. The hotels were a lot more expensive than the prices quoted in the book and were also much further from the beach than we expected. We eventually checked into the first hotel we had looked at and got a double room for $11.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 4 o'clock we walked down to the beach where we lay for about an hour. The beach was not particularly impressive. It was a nice enough bay but there was a lot of seaweed and the sea was full of jelly fish.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the hotel and decided on the way that we would leave Bocas del Toro in the morning and head for Cahuita, another beach resort in Costa Rica.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 14th Oct</span>
                We got up at 5:45 and walked to the port to catch the 6:30 boat back to Almirante. The boat was totally full and we could not get on but fortunately it came back an hour later to pick up another load (the next one was supposed to be at 4pm).
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Almirante, we got straight onto a bus to Changuinola and from there we caught another to Guabito on the Costa Rica border. We arrived at the border at about 9:30 and crossed into Costa Rica without any problems. On the other side of the border, we changed money in a supermarket, finally had breakfast and then waited an hour for a bus to Cahuita. The bus took two and a half hours and arrived in Cahuita at 12:30
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Cahuita is a much better beach resort than any we have been to so far on the trip. We got a double room costing $7 a night just across the road from a fairly nice beach and there is a much nicer beach in a national park within about 10 - 15 minutes walk. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, the weather is excellent and there are not nearly as many mosquitoes as we had expected. There is also a book exchange where they do not seem to charge for swapping books.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about an hour on the beach, looked around the town and then lazed around in the room until tea-time. The food in Cahuita seemed quite expensive but we managed to get a very filling meal for about $2.50.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 15th Oct</span>
                Listened to the football results at 10 though I missed the Swansea score and then spent about three hours on the beach. We went to the white sand beach in Cahuita National Park. It is a typical palm fringed beach with lovely sand and warm clear water - by far the best beach we have been to so far.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 16th Oct</span>
                In the evening we found an excellent restaurant doing pizzas and other food, much cheaper than most of the restaurants in the village.
