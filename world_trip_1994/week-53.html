                We arrived at Istanbul's main bus station at about 7:30 after a mainly sleepless night. We got the service bus into Aksaray and the tram down to Sirkeci where we checked straight into the same hotel we were in three and a half weeks ago. By 9, we had had showers and set off to find the Yugoslavian consulate to try and obtain the first of the visas that we require for our journey home.
            </p>    
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_125.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got the bus out to Nişantaşı and found the consulate without too many problems. The consulate had a fairly efficient way of handling visa applications. We were not allowed into the building and had to wait in the street for a man who appeared at a window about once every half an hour. The first time he appeared, he gave us our application forms. On his second appearance, we returned the forms with our passports and the TL1,000,000 each and half an hour later he handed us passports complete with visas. It all came as quite a relief after our last attempt for visas at the Syrian embassy in Jordon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel stopping for kebabs on the way. After a couple of hours of much needed sleep, we went out again to buy our bus ticket for leaving on Wednesday. We bought one way tickets to Sofia for US$15 each. From Sofia, we plan to travel by bus or train through Yugoslavia and Hungary to Bratislava. After a couple of days there, we will keep going until we reach Paris where we again plan to stay for a couple of days. If all goes to plan, we will leave Paris on about August 4th, cross the channel and stay in Brighton a night before returning home on the 6th.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After buying our tickets we wandered round the Egyptian Bazaar buying apple tea and Turkish Delight to take home with us.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we walked round the Sultahamet area and then came back to a restaurant near our hotel for an excellent meal.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th July</span>
                We got up at 7:15 and by 7:45 were on our way to the Bulgarian consulate for the second (and last) of our required visas. We were told to get there by 9:30 to ensure we got the visas on the same day and after a 45 minute bus journey and a ten minute walk, we arrived at the consulate at 8:55. There was already a large queue forming when we arrived and when we had our names taken there were 68 people on the list ahead of us waiting to apply for visas. Only a few people were being let in at a time and by 10 o'clock, it was looking unlikely that we would get in at all. By about 10:45 we were getting towards the front of the queue. Roz told the man on the gate that we only wanted transit visas and he eventually decided to let us both in ahead of our turn. It appeared that we had not needed to queue up but no-one had told us despite us repeated ly stating what we required.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once inside, things were fairly straight-forward. We handed over our passports and TL900,000 each (no application forms or photographs were necessary) and were told to go and wait outside. Half an hour or so later we were given back our passports complete with the visas. We now have all the required visas for our journey home. We got the bus back to Enionu, had lunch and returned to the hotel. In the afternoon we visited the Grand Bazaar and Egyptian Bazaar and completed our present and souvenir buying for the trip. Before tea we went for a couple of beers in a back-packer type bar and then ate at the same place as yesterday.

                We didn't do a lot all morning apart from lie around in the room waiting for midday check out. At 12, we went out for lunch and then traveled out to the bus station by tram and tube. We arrived at the bus station at about 1:15 and spent the afternoon sat in one of the waiting rooms. The bus was due to leave at 5:30. We got on at 5 but it was another two hours before it eventually pulled out. The journey to Erdine was very quick and we arrived at the Bulgarian border just before 10pm.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I had been half expecting problems getting out of Turkey because of our lack of entry stamps. When we presented our passports, we were turned back and made to walk over to a police office near the border. Once there, the problem was sorted out in about ten minutes with a couple of phone calls and we were allowed to leave the country.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once we had our exit stamps, we dashed back to the bus not wanting to get left behind. This proved unnecessary as, due to some problem on the Bulgarian side which caused a huge backlog of buses, we did not get through the border until 3:30am. At just over five and a half hours, this was the longest border crossing we had ever made. Roz nearly didn't get through as the Bulgarian border guard did not believe that she was the same person as was pictured in her passport! Once through the border, we had a totally unnecessary tea stop and did not get going again until just after 4.

                We made up quite a bit of the wasted time and arrived in Sofia only a couple of hours late at 8am. We had a quick look around the bus station and found a bus going all the way to Bratislava at 9. We briefly considered this but decided that it was a pretty boring option although it would probably save us a lot of hassle. Instead, we crossed the road to the train station and found the international ticket office. This proved to be a surprisingly efficient place with no queues and an English speaking ticket seller. We found out the price of the train to Bratislava and then just needed to change money to pay for the tickets. Several people were offering to change money and we found someone offering a much better rate than the bank. He turned out to be one of the worst con artists we had ever seen. His hands were shaking non stop throughout the transaction and he tried the inevitable switch of our money for a smaller sum, his attempt really was laughable.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                At this point we decided to stick with the banks and the lower rates. Roz watched the bags while I went to change the money and I also went round a couple of places tryign to buy discounted student tickets without success. When I got back, Roz bought the tickets onto tonights train to Budapest via Belgrade.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had sorted everything out, left our rucksacks in left-luggage and walked into town, it was lunchtime. We found a restaurant, had an excellent meal and then spent a couple of hours sat or lying on benches in a park.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 4, we walked round a couple of the sights and then found another bar/restaurant to sit in for a couple of hours. After we had eaten, we walked back to the station where we had a couple more beers, collected our luggage and went up to the platform to wait for our train.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The train had come from Istanbul so it was quite a surprise when it pulled into the station at 10:20, right on time. We had reserved seats but as soon as we got on the train, we were told to get into a compartment with a Bulgarian family. The whole train was full of Bulgarians who seemed to have no tickets but large quantities of clothes that they were smuggling into Yugoslavia. We reached the border after about an hour. At the Yugoslavian side, just about everyone on the train except us had their passports taken away and were made to get off - some were literally thrown off the train. We didn't know what was going on so just stayed sitting where we were and keeping quiet. By the time the train pulled out, only about a third of the passengers seemed to be back on the train and the family from our compartment were no-where to be seen.

                We arrived in Belgrade at 8am and briefly got off the train for a photo to prove that we had been there. The rest of the journey to Budapest was fairly uneventful compared to last night. The train was quite empty and we had a compartment to ourselves for a lot of the day.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Budapest at 5pm two and a half hours late. We were unsure about whether or not we needed reservations for our next train to Bratislava but after a few miuntes we decided not to bother and headed for McDonalds instead. The food seemed excellent after 24 hours of eating biscuits and Turkish delight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 6:00 we boarded the 6:20 train for Bratislava. It left on time and we arrived three hours later at 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had thought that by the time we reached Bratislava, everything would be straightforward after the potential problems of the last couple of days. However, when we walked into the centre of town, we discovered that the hotel that we had planned to stay in had been converted into a block of offices. We had no guide book, no money and did not really know what to do for the night. After half an hour of wandering around we changed money at an expensive hotel and they were able to direct us to somewhere cheaper.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a room for just over £20, had showers which we were both in desperate need of and went straight to sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th July</span>
                We got up at about 10 and went straight to find out about bus and train details for getting home. We immedeatly ruled out the train as it was too expensive and went instead to the international bus station. We wanted to book a bus to Paris but the ones for this week were full and were not leaving at ideal times anyway. We went back to the hotel for a re-think and came up with the idea of going to Munich instead of Paris. We returned to the bus station to find that this option was not only too expensive (nearly the same price as the Paris bus) but once again, there were no buses leaving when we wanted to travel. After a lot of thought, we decided that our best option would be to try hitching. We plan to head in the direction of Munich but take just about any lifts in the direction of home and see where we end up.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                The remainder of the day was spent going round the places we have drunk in on previous visits to Bratislava. It was a very enjoyable session although I remember very little of the later part of the evening.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th July</span>
                We got up at 7:30and went out for a hot dog and  amuch needed bottle of fanta. We then went back to the hotel and slept until about 12:30. We went back to the beer hall where we ate yesterday for lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon in a couple more bars.
            </p>    
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a couple of hours back at the hotel, we had another evening of eating and drinking but ended up nowhere near as drunk as we were last night.
