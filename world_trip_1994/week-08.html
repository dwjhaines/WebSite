                We got up at 8 and at 8:30 Roz, Gary and I got a taxi to Miraflores where we had to collect their travelers cheques. Miraflores was another world to the part of Lima we were staying in with modern banks, hotels, restaurants and travel agencies and even a Burger King. We collected Roz's cheque from a Thomas Cook agent and then walked to a near-by bank for Gary's. Both transactions were completed without any problems and by 10 we had got another taxi back to the hotel. Dave and Ed returned from their shopping trip not long after us with a days supply of ham cheese and bread for our bus journey.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi to the bus station at midday and got on our bus by 12:30. The bus was better than we had expected it to be - just as well considering how long we had to stay on it. The bus journey was pretty uninteresting and uneventful.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 13th Sept</span>
                We arrived in Tumbes just after 10, 2.5 hours earlier than expected. We got a taxi to the border stopping en route to get our passports stamped. At Aguas Verdes we walked across the bridge into Ecuador, got our passports stamped again, changed money and then got straight onto another bus going to Guayaquil. We arrived at 3:30 and got a taxi into the centre where we checked into a hotel and all had much needed showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Yesterday in Lima when we saw Burger King, we had no money and no time so had to miss out. Fortunately, there was also a Burger King in Guayaquil so for the first time since Buenos Aires we could go out for a proper "British" meal. We all had double whoppers with large chips and cokes which cost about £2.50 each. It came as a much needed break from the local delicacies that we have become used to.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the hotel by 7:30 and had an early night.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 14th Sept</span>
                We decided to stay in Guayaquil for a day as Roz was getting stomach pains and wanted to see a doctor. We changed money at 9:00 and then went to one of the doctors recommended by Lonely Planet. The doctor diagnosed a parasite and prescribed four different sets of tablets to sort it out. After we had collected these from the pharmacy we returned to the hotel for a late breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At midday we all set off to the Olympic for a couple of hours sun-bathing. However, when we arrived, it was closed and showed no signs of opening so we returned to the hotel for a couple of hours sleep instead. During the afternoon, Gary and I both went out for hair-cuts.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Burger King for a repeat of last night's meal in the evening and also collected a load of food from a supermarket for tomorrows breakfast. Back at the hotel we played cards until bed time.

                We got up just before 6, had breakfast and by 6:30 were on our way to the bus station. We got a "fast" bus to Esmereldas at 7:45 and we arrived there just after 2pm. We got straight on another bus to the beach resort of Atacames where we plan to stay for a few days. We arrived at Atacames at about 3 and Dave, Roz & I went off to look for a hotel while Gary and Ed looked after the luggage. It took us over an hour to find somewhere. The place we had chosen from the book was full and a lot more expensive than expected. All the other places we tried were full and eventually we had to book into an expensive hotel with swimming pool. It was all very pleasant but cost about £10 a night each which is slightly out of most of our budgets and a long way out of Gary's. We decided to check in for one night and try to find something cheaper for tomorrow. We carried all our luggage back to the hotel and then spent an hour in the swimming pool which was excellent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we found a cheaper place to stay and reserved a room for five for tomorrow night. Atacames seems like a pretty good place to stay for a few days. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from and the beach which is just across the road from the hotels also looks good.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 16th Sept</span>
                After breakfast, we spent a couple of hours lazing around. The swimming pool didn't open until 10:30so we only had about an hour in the pool before we had to check out. We were slightly under-charged for the room but it still cost 154,000 sucre - about £44.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked round the corner to the hotel where we had reserved a room only to find that they had let it go to someone else despite the fact that we had already paid for our first night. They offered us alternative accommodation which was not as good so we took our money back and went to look elsewhere. We spent ages walking around looking for alternatives but everywhere we went was either full, too expensive or too grotty. There did not seem to be any mid-range hotels.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_025.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Eventually, Dave, Ed and Gary accepted a room at the place we had eaten last night. Roz and I were shown a room (after waiting 2 hours) but turned it down as the constant noise from the bars was deafening. We eventually gave up and decided to leave Atacames and go back to Esmereldas. We divided up team money and arranged to meet the others in Quito either tomorrow or on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By this time it was about 3pm and by the time we got to Esmereldas it was gone 4. We checked into the Hotel Roma which was cheaper than the room we were offered in Atacames and infinitely better. There was not a lot to do in Esmereldas but we had a good tea (mainly of chips) followed by an excellent pineapple juice, all for about £1.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 17th Sept</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at 10 and walked down to the main plaza where we had told the others we would be at this time. There was no sign of them so we assumed that they had got drunk last night and were too hungover to travel. We got on a bus at 10:20 (missing the football results) and arrived in Quito at about 3:30. We walked from the bus station to a hotel where we had a good room with balcony and a good view for 8000 sucre each - far more within our budget.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There was no sign of the others by 7pm so we caught a bus into "New Town" where we had one of the best meals of the trip so far in a Mexican restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 18th Sept</span>
                We woke up to find that our hotel room was once again out of water so we packed our bags and moved to another just around the corner. We desperately needed to do some washing - it is two weeks since we last had any done. We put some stuff in the hotel laundry service and did the rest by hand in the bedroom.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had breakfast at the hotel. Our new hotel is similar to last nights one in that it is pretty run down and has no-one staying at it. It is however slightly cheaper, has a good courtyard for sitting in and seems to have constant running water.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the morning walking round the sights of the old town. Roz phoned England about her Barclaycard and we also found out bus times to various destinations so we can sort out our plans for the next week.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours sat in the sun reading before going out for lunch (salchipapas). In the evening we met up with the others and went back to the Mexican restaurant (We were right about the hangovers!)
