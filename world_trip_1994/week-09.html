                Dave, Gary and Ed checked into our hotel which was a lot cheaper than theirs at 8 o'clock. We had breakfast and then went to the post office to collect letters for the first time on the trip. I had two letters but Roz didn't get any. We arranged to meet the others tomorrow as we had planned to leave Quito today and went back to the hotel. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked down to the bus station where we caught the 10:20 bus to Ambata and from there, another to the town of Baños. We arrived in Baños at 1:45 and checked into the hotel where we had arranged to meet the others.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the remainder of the afternoon at a thermal swimming pool (for which Baños is famous). The weather was not wonderful but it was warm enough as long as you stayed in the water.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got drunk for the first time since leaving Cuzco. We started off with a bottle of rum in the room (£1 a bottle). At 8:30, we went out to eat and by this time my memory was already starting to go. We bought another bottle of rum which we started drinking while we waited for our food and after eating, went to "The Hard Rock Cafe". We stayed there for about an hour and then returned to the hotel for more rum before falling asleep.

                We woke up with slight hangovers and didn't do a lot for the rest of the morning. The others arrived at the hotel at 1:45. I had decided it was about time we had an all day session. Everyone else was keen so by 2pm we were sat in a restaurant with our first beers of the day in front of us. We had lunch in the restaurant and stayed there drinking beer until about 6:00. We had not been drinking quickly so at this point, we were all quite sober.
                </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel and started on the rum and cokes. we got through three bottles between 6 and 9 and then went out to the Hard Rock Cafe. By now we were all totally pissed, especially Ed and no-one remembers too clearly what happened for the rest of the night. At some point we went back to the hotel where Roz was sick on the floor of the other's bedroom and Ed was sick on himself while unconscious on his bed. We got told off for the amount of noise we were making so after a while we went back to the Hard Rock Cafe (without Ed). We drank Pina Coladas and more rum and coke until at about 3am when it was just me and Gary left we decided we had finally had enough. We staggered back to the hotel where I became the third person of the evening to be sick.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 21st Sept</span>
                I had one of the worst hangovers of my life and spent most of the day either trying to sleep or throwing up. Roz and I were both sick another four times and I was not capable of eating anything until about 5pm.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 22nd Sept</span>
                I had just about recovered by this morning and was capable of eating again. After breakfast we all went to one of the swimming pools and did our first serious sun-bathing of the trip so far. After lunch we walked 2km to another pool which was not as good. Had a quiet evening writing postcards, playing cards, etc.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 23rd Sept</span>
                Another day spent lazing around the pools not doing a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we had Ed's leaving session. This consisted of drinking one and two thirds bottles of rum prior to going out for tea, another bottle with our meal, a couple of cocktails each and another two bottles of rum to round the evening off whe we returned to the hotel. We were all; pretty drunk though nowhere near as bad as on the last session.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 24th Sept</span>
                I was releived to wake up with a normal hangover, not nearly as bad as the one three days ago. We listened to the football results but didn't do a lot else until about 2pm when we went down to the swimming pool. After a couple of hours, we returned to the hotel and then went round a few souvenir shops.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to our usual restaurant in the evening. We have eaten nearly every meal in the same place for the last six days. It was a hamburger bar that did excellent chips, great burgers and huge platefuls of food in the evenings, all at reasonable prices.

                We had to leave Baños earlier than planned so we could fit in a visit to the equator before Ed's departure on Monday night. We got up at 7, had breakfast and caught the 8 o'clock bus back to Quito. We walked back to the last hotel we had stayed in and all managed to check into the same rooms as last time. We had two separate trips to the equator with Gary, Dave and Ed going off before Roz and I. We set off at about 1:30. The equator is only about 14 miles North of Quito but it took the bus just over an hour to get there. The monument was quite well done but was nothing really spectacular. We spent about an hour walking around taking photos of ourselves in different hemispheres, etc before getting the bus back to Quito.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a much needed rest, we returned to the Mexican restaurant in the New Town for another excellent meal.
