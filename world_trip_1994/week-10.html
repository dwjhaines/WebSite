                After breakfast, we went to the post office to check for letters but all we got was a beer mat from Regan. Roz and I caught a bus into the new town where we went round a few travel agents trying to find an alternative to the 48 hour bus journey from Quito to the Caribbean coast. All the flights were far too expensive so we gave up, went and looked round a book shop and then went back to the bus station in the old town. Here we checked the bus times to Tulcan for tomorrow and also both phoned home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to the hotel to collect the others and we all went back to the new town, this time to visit the British Council. Here we spent about an hour reading recent copies of English newspapers, mainly catching up on football results and news.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                From the British Council, we walked to the South American Explorers Club where they allowed us to make use of their book exchange despite not being members (book exchanges seem to be very rare in South America and Dave, Roz and I were all getting desperate for new books). We returned to the hotel, showered and then went back to the new town yet again, this time to a pizza place where we had the best pizzas of the trip so far. It was our last meal in Ecuador and I don't think we have eaten a single Ecuadorian dish in the two weeks we have been here!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Back at the hotel we split up team and said our goodbyes to Ed who leaves for Hong Kong at 4:30 tomorrow morning.
            </p>

                Ed left at 4:30. The rest of us checked poste restante for a final time, posted a load of letters home (a lot more than we had received!) and then went back to the hotel to collect our rucksacks. We walked down to the bus station and caught the first bus in what was to become a 52 hour journey to Santa Marta in Colombia.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left at 10 and arrived in Tulcan just before 3. Roz and I managed to lose the other two for nearly an hour and we eventually met up and got in a taxi to the border by about 4. The border into Colombia was pretty straight-forward (as they all have been) and by 4:30 we had changed money and got a taxi into the town of Ipiales. We were dropped off at the Boliviano bus terminal and we immediately bought tickets for the 5 o'clock bus to Bogotá - a 24 hour journey costing just over $41 each. We bought tuna, biscuits, crisps, etc for the trip and got straight onto the bus. It was the best bus we had ever been on - air-conditioned, loads fo leg room and less than half full. We each had two seats to ourselves and had a pretty good nights sleep.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 28th Sept</span>
                We arrived in Bogotá at 3:45 and were keen to leave as quickly as possible. We managed to change another $160 and bought tickets for the 5pm bus to Santa Marta (Bogotá bus station was a huge modern place similar in size to a major airport. All the other bus stations we have seen in Colombia have been modern efficiently run places and have also seemed pretty safe)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We stocked up with food again and just before 5, we boarded a bus similar to the one we had been on for the previous 24 hours. This trip was due to take 18 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 29th Sept</span>
                We arrived in Santa Marta at 2pm (3 hours late) 52 hours after leaving Quito. The journey had been no effort at all apart from the first five hours on the Ecuadorian side of the border, a lot better than expected.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught a local bus into town and checked into a hotel costing under £1 each. After much needed showers we went out for our first hot meal for over two days and then returned to the hotel to lie down for the rest of the afternoon. The weather at Santa Marta is far hotter than anywhere we have been so far - still in the 30's at 4pm. We learnt during the afternoon that the beach that we had planned to visit is in a national park that has been closed for several months, and it is uncertain as to whether or not we will be able to enter it.
            </p>

                After breakfast, Dave, Roz and I went off to change travelers cheques and to try and get some more information about Tayrona National Park. We successfully managed to cash the travelers cheques but did not really sort out anything about Tayrona. It appears that the park is officially closed, however, we were told we could get to the beach by hiring a guide and walking 8km through the jungle. We did manage to get information about flights to Panama City from Cartagena (about $150, 4 days a week).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to go to the beach near Taganga for the afternoon and see what it was like before making a decision on Tayrona. We caught a mini-bus to Taganga and then walked for 20 minutes to Playa Grande. The beach was pretty good and we had an enjoyable afternoon lying around, reading despite the fact that it was cloudy for most of the time we were there. On the way back we looked at hotels in Taganga only to find they cost five times as much as the hotel in Santa Marta. We will probably stay in Santa Marta for a few days and "commute" to the beach.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st Oct</span>
                We decided to get down to the beach early and set off at about 9:15 with two Swiss girls, one of whom had come and joined our game of cards last night. We got to the beach by 9:45 and spent the first hour and a half listening to the football on World Service (Wycombe 1, Swansea 0). The weather was excellent. We stayed on the beach until 2:30, all getting our share of sun-burn.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got back to the hotel at about 4 and didn't do a lot else for the rest of the day.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd Oct</span>
                We were too burnt to risk going to the beach today. We did washing in the morning. In the afternoon we found an outdoor swimming pool. We will probably stay here until Wednesday. There is not a lot to do here but we are all enjoying doing nothing except working on our sun-tans.
            </p>
