                Dave, Gary and I made the trip into Puerto Limon to stock up on food for the coming week and to change enough money to last us until we leave Cahuita.

                Both days were similar to just about every other day we have had here. Bread and tuna for breakfast, down to the beach between about 9 and 3, a drink in the afternoon and then back to our usual restaurant for our evening meal (the same place every night since Sun 16th). Despite doing the same thing every day, we are not yet bored with it and the time is flying by.

                Roz and I got drunk in the evening. We had half a bottle of rum in the room before going out for tea, half a bottle on the white sand beach and then finished the bottle left over from our previous session while sat on the beach opposite where we are staying. I don't remember a lot about the evening.

                I had a hangover and spent most of the morning in bed. Went to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon.

                We got up early to listen to the football only to discover that the clocks have gone back in England and it did not start until 9 o'clock. The reception was terrible and they did not give the 2nd division results. Spent the rest of the day on the beach.

                Our last day in Cahuita. It really has been an excellent place to stay - one of the best beaches we have ever been to. We have done just about the same thing every day and eaten in the same restaurant for 15 nights in a row (either spaghetti or pizza) but are still sorry to be leaving.

                Tomorrow we start traveling again, heading first for San Jose where we hope to collect mail and Guatemalan visas and then continuing through Central America and Mexico to arrive in L.A. in six and a half weeks time.
