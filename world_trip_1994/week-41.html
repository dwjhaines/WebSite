                We had planned to cycle to the railway station to buy our tickets and then spend the day watching the May Day celebrations in Tianaman Square. However, when Roz and I went down to collect Hoggy, we tried to book a Great Wall trip for tomorrow and were told that there was no trip tomorrow but we could go today if we wanted. We had a quick change of plan, paid our money, went downstairs to buy sandwiches for the trip and half an hour later were sat on a bus heading out towards the wall.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got to the bus dropping off point just before 11 and had half an hour climb to reach the wall. The wall was pretty spectacular (much the same as the photos) and the surrounding scenery was also well worth seeing. We walked along the wall for about one and a half hours before going back down to wait for the bus which finally departed at 2:50. We were back at the hotel by 4:30.

                We got up, had breakfast and then cycled to the station where we had no problem at all booking ourselves hard sleepers to Canton for Friday night. We cycled back to Tianaman Square and parked our bikes so we could start our day's sight-seeing. We had planned to visit Mao's Mausoleum but were put off by the incredibly long queues. Instead, we climbed to the top of one of the gates to the square which was not particularly impressive but gave us a better view of the people queuing below. We then cycled to a bank to change money and went to another McDonalds for lunch.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent an hour walking up and down a shopping street in search of Chinese maps and English books and then caught the underground out to the Lama Temple. Traveling on the underground was quite an experience in itself or at least getting on and off the train was. The Lama Temple was not the most spectacular sight we have seen so far was reasonably interesting and the 26 wooden Buddhas in the final hall made the visit worthwhile. We caught the tube back to where we had parked our bikes and cycled back to the hotel. Beijing is proving to be quite enjoyable, one of the best capital cities we have been to. There is plenty to do. Everything is easily accessible by bike and the cycling itself is good fun. Also we have good accommodation near an excellent restaurant with good food and beer at 10p a pint.

                After breakfast, we hired bikes and cycled to Tianaman Square. We parked the bikes and started walking to the Forbidden City. As we were passing Mao's Mausoleum, we noticed that the queues were far shorter than yesterdays so we decided to go and have a look. The queues were still fairly long but moved pretty quickly. Once inside the mausoleum everyone is hurried past the body as quickly as possible with no standing around and no photography. Although we only had a brief glimpse, we can now all say we have seen the body of Mao.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Our next stop was the Forbidden City which Lonely Planet seems to think needs a whole day to see. It was quite impressive with plenty of typically Chinese type buildings to photograph, however, we were in and out in just over an hour. It was similar in some ways to the Grand Palace in Bangkok but not nearly as a spectacular. When we left the Forbidden City we climbed a hill behind it for good overall views of the buildings and then had a long walk back to our bikes.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate at our usual restaurant in the evening and ended up staying until midnight getting quite pissed in the process.

                Hoggy and I went to The Summer Palace. We spent just over an hour getting there by bus, train and minibus. Once there, we spent a couple of hours walking around the various buildings which in many ways were very similar to those of the Forbidden City. It was all laid out in very pleasant surroundings and was quite enjoyable to wander around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got back to the hotel by minibus and bus and spent most of the afternoon sleeping.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 5th May</span>
                We had all day to wait for our train and as we had seen all the sights we wanted to, ended up not doing a lot. We checked out of the hotel at midday and spent a few hours cycling around looking at shops and markets. We were back at the hotel by 5 for showers and then went down to the Friendship Restaurant for the last time. Once again, we had an excellent meal and a few beers for hardly any money.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 8ish, we collected our bags from the hotel, stocked up on sandwiches and soft drinks and caught a bus out to the railway station. We had about an hour to wait for our train which pulled out on time at 10:24. The journey to Canton was due to take 32 hours.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 6th May</span>
                The day passed quite quickly without too much incident. We spent our time reading, playing cards, eating and staring out of the window.

                We were due to arrive in Canton at 6:30 but the train was late and did not get in until 9:30. We had planned to get a bus back to Shengzen which would have taken five hours but when we got into Canton we found a train that was going directly there in about two hours. After some confusion, we got ourselves tickets and boarded the train (using our student cards for the final time).
