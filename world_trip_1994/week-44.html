                We got up at 6:30 and had breakfast. We decided that we would do the boat trip out to the volcano even if it meant hiring a whole boat to ourselves. At our hotel they would not come down from their price of 500 Pesos for the trip so we walked back into Talisay where we got one for 400.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip was pretty good. We had a half hour boat trip to get to the island and then, with an 11 year old boy for a guide, had a half hour walk up to the rim of the volcano. The view from the rim was very spectacular. The volcano contained another brightly coloured lake and in places was still smoking. We spent 10 - 15 minutes stood at the top before climbing down and getting the boat back to Talisay.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the hotel for showers, checked out and started heading for Puerto Galera. We got a jeepney out to the main road and were then lucky to get straight onto a bus heading for Batangas in plenty of time for the 3:30 ferry so were able to get across to Puerto Galera quicker than we had expected to. The boat took two hours and we then had another jeepney ride to get to the beach at Salang.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The beach was quite a disappointment when we finally arrived. There were plenty of hotels and bars but the beach itself was rocky, dirty looking and totally disappeared at high tide. We had to stay the night there but decided to move on first thing tomorrow morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 16th May</span>
                We checked out of the hotel, had breakfast and got a jeepney back to Puerto Galera. From there, we got another jeepney out to White Beach which we had been told was a lot better. Once there, we found that the beach was a lot better and we managed to get reasonable accommodation a few minutes walk from the beach. The only problem now was the weather. It was not warm enough for sun-bathing so after walking along the beach for ten minutes or so we decided that for the second time in a week that we may as well spend the day drinking. We had a couple of beers in the beach-side bars and then went back to the room to start on the rum and coke again. Rum here is cheaper than we have seen it anywhere else in the world at about 25p for a half bottle. We got through a half bottle during the afternoon while playing cards and started on a second one before going out to eat. We ate at the hotel restaurant, had a couple more beers and then returned to the room to finish the rum. We got to bed at about midnight.

                The weather was a lot better today so despite slight hangovers, we managed to spend some time on the beach for the first time since leaving Koh Samui.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 18th May</span>
                Once again, the weather was good enough for sun-bathing.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                During the afternoon, Steve and Sarah, a couple we had frequently bumped into during our trip round China, turned up at our hotel. We had a couple of beers with them and also ate out with them in the evening.

                We had decided to leave White Beach and try to reach Boracay, a supposedly more developed island in time for the F. A. Cup Final tomorrow night. We have no idea whether or not we will be able to see it there but think that there is more chance than if we remain at White Beach.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The day's traveling started quite smoothly. We left our room at 6:30, immediately got a jeepney to Puerto Galera and another from there to Calapan two hours away. We got a bus for three hours to Bonbabong and then a jeepney to Roxas.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Roxas after about seven hours of traveling. We got a ride in a pedicab out to the port where the ferries departed from and it was there that our problems began. We had not expected to be able to get a boat directly to Boracay and were told that the next one goes in three days time. We had hoped however, to be able to get a boat out to Tablas Island from where we would be able to get across to Boracay first thing tomorrow morning. We discovered that the next boat to Tablas is at 10:30 tomorrow morning and will probably not get us there in time for a boat to Boracay. This all means that we will probably not make Boracay until sometime on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent quite a bit of time considering our options and at one stage thought about returning to Manila and proceeding to Boracay from there. We eventually decided to keep going the way we were which meant waiting a night in Roxas for tomorrow's boat. The accommodation by the port was pretty crap so we got a pedicab back into the town where we got ourselves a small but cheap room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The choice of restaurants was not huge in Roxas so we ended up having cheese-burgers for lunch and tea already having had the same thinig for breakfast. The whole town had shut down by 7 o'clock so we had an early night.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 20th May</span>
                We got a pedicab to the port at 8am. After a lot of argument, we managed to buy tickets for the 10:30 ferry to Tablas for the same price as the locals were paying. The boat left about an hour late and arrived at Odiongan on Tablas at about 3pm by which time we had realised that there was no way we would make Boracayuntil tomorrow.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a jeepney to Looc and found out that the next boat leaves at 9:30 tomorrow morning. We had no choice but to stay in Looc which was even deader than Roxas. We checked into Mr Moralez's pension and had tuna rolls for tea as the whole town seemed to have shut by 6pm.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of beers and then stayed up to listen to the F. A. Cup Final on World Service.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 21st May</span>
                We had tuna rolls again for breakfast and were then escorted to the ferry pier by Mr Moralez's daughter.  The crossing to Boracay took about two hours and we arrived in Manoc Manoc shortly before midday. We got a motor-tricycle round to White Beach and were taken to a hotel near the beach. Boracay is much more developed than the beaches around Puerto Galera and has an excellent choice of bars and restaurants. We spent an hour on the beach which is also excellent and then went for lunch. On the way to lunch we found a much nicer room for the same price so we will move tomorrow. In the evening we had a few beers in a bar which charged 10 Pesos a bottle and had our fisrt really good meal since leaving the last beach.
