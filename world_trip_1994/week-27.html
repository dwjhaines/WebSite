                It was pretty cloudy when we woke up so after a lot of indecision we packed up our stuff and headed back to Kuta. The journey involved five different bemos and we arrived in Kuta at about 1pm. We looked at a few losmen in the Poppies Lanes area, an area we had not been to before but which was much cheaper for food and accommodation than the main roads of Kuta. We ended up staying in the third place we looked at and got a room for Rp10,000 a night.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the afternoon wandering round the shops and restaurants of the area. In the evening we watched The Client in one of the video bars before eating.

                The weather here seems to be a lot better than in the rest of Indonesia and we were able to spend quite a bit of time on the beach.

                We spent a few hours on the beach again during the day. The beach here is no-where near as nice as it was five years ago and the sea today was decidedly unpleasant - full of rubbish and sea-weed.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we did a pub crawl around Kuta's bars. We started at 4:30 watching The Mask at one of the video bars and then went along the bars on Legian Road stopping at the ones with happy hours. By moving along the road, it was possible to be in happy hours from 5:30 all the way through to midnight. By 10:30 we had made it as far as The Bounty where we both had Jam Jars ("The Biggest Bloody Drink in the World") which were nasty mixtures of five spirits, an extra shot of arak and about two pints of orange juice. I remember drinking about half of mine and then nothing else.

                We didn't do a lot all day as we both had hangovers.

                We decided that as the beach here was so dirty, we would spend a few days at a hotel with a swimming pool. We went out and had a look at a couple and found one with an excellent pool, good rooms and a TV for about Rp27,000 including breakfast. We checked in just before 10:00 and spent the rest of the morning lying by the pool listening to the 4th Test from Australia. At midday we went back to The Bounty for the Bounty Brunch, an excellent all-you-can-eat breakfast of bacon, eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, tomatoes, toast, fruit salad and unlimited fruit juice. It was without doubt the best breakfast we have had since leaving home and cost just over Â£2. After a couple of hours of recovery, we spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool. We saw Clear and Present Danger in the evening.

                We spent a couple of hours by the pool and then went to watch The Firm, the best of the films we have seen since we have been here. In the evening we had the hotel TV to ourselves for the Burnley v Liverpool F. A. Cup match - another 0 - 0.

                The day was spent lying by the pool and walking round the shops buying presents for Roz's birthday. We saw Four Weddings and a Funeral in the evening.
