                We were woken at 5:40 and given a fried egg and toast for breakfast. We packed up our things and by 6:20 were waiting outside the hotel for our bus. The bus turned up just after 6:30 and took us to another bus at the terminal about 2km away. By 7 we were on our way to Bogor, a not too exciting journey that took a total of nine hours. The journey should have been shorter and more spectacular but the Puncak Pass, the main reason for doing the bus journey was apparently closed and we had to use a less direct route.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Bogor bus station we were met by someone from the hotel we had planned to stay at. He took us back to the hotel by public bemo and by about 5pm we had checked into a room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We found an excellent restaurant for tea and were both in bed asleep by about 9.

                After breakfast at the hotel, we walked to a bank to change money, collected our luggage from the hotel and set off for the railway station. We got the 9:33 train into Jakarta and arrived at Gambir station shortly before 11. We had a 1km walk to the area of cheap hotels and found a reasonable room for Rp16,000 a night.

                We were both hungry by this time so we went to McDonalds for lunch. We then tried to sort out our boat tickets for this weekend's trip to Medan and also obtain information from both the Thai and Malaysian embassies. We found the Thai embassy which was closed, gave up on the Malaysian one and by the time we had found out how to get to the Pelni office, we were told that we would probably be too late for that as well. We gave up and decided to try again tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We didn't do a lot during the afternoon although I did manage to find a better hotel that we will probably move to tomorrow. In the evening, we both had good Thai curries in a restaurant near our hotel.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 15th Feb</span>
                We got up at 7:20 and headed straight for the Pelni office. We arrived there just after it opened at 8 and found it to be a far more modern and civilised place than the one in Surabaya had been five years ago. We bought tickets for Saturday's boat without any problems and by 8:40 we were on our way again, this time heading for the embassies on the other side of town.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip to the Thai embassy involved two buses, one of which was packed and seemed to take ages. Once there, we were told that we still need to buy visas in advance if we wanted to stay longer than 15 days (despite what Regan had told us). With this piece of bad news, we proceeded along the road to the Malaysian embassy only to find that it had closed down and moved elsewhere. We had a two to three mile walk to the new building where we were eventually told that the day we arrive in KL will be a public holiday and the post office will not be open until the following Tuesday. This was more bad news as we are both expecting mail when we arrive there and do not really want to wait in KL for that long. We decided to try and change our flights to arrive in KL before the holidays and caught a bus back to the hotel to collect our tickets and travelers cheques.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By this time it was about 11 o'clock and we were already hot, tired and hungry. We left the hotel again, changed money and then walked back to the Thai embassy where we left our passports and visa applications. We walked from there to a Garuda office where we discovered that the flights on the two days before ours were both full so we have to fly on the 3rd. By now we were both starving and felt that we deserved another McDonalds lunch. We could not be bothered to move hotels and spent most of the afternoon recovering from all this morning's walking around. In the evening we ate at the same place as last night.

                We spent most of the day visiting "Taman Mini Indonesia Indah", a mini Indonesia cultural theme park. We collected our passports from the Thai embassy at 10am and caught a couple of buses out to the park - a journey of about an hour. The park consisted of a lake filled with small islands representing a map of Indonesia, surrounded by buildings from all over the country demonstrating the different building styles of the area. There were free minibuses to ferry you round the exhibits and an excellent cable car ride for the best views of the park. It was all quite interesting and well laid out - better than we thought it would be!

                A relatively quiet day. I visited the British Council to look at up to date league tables in the morning and we then spent a couple of hours in McDonalds and Pizza Hut - not eating much but making the most of the air-conditioning.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we went for curries in the same restaurant for the fourth night in a row.

                We got up at 8ish and went for a final visit to McDonalds. We bought food from the supermarket to take on to the boat with us and at about 10:30 got a taxi out to Tanjung Priok, Jakarta's main port. The taxi ride took the best part of an hour and dropped us off at the Pelni terminal building. We had about half an hour wait before the doors of the waiting room were opened and together with five other back-packers and about 1000 Indonesians we were allowed to walk across the harbour to our boat.

                The boat was identical to the one we were on five years ago. However, whereas the last one we were on was half empty, this one was totally packed with people lying on floors, in corridors and anywhere else there was enough space to lie down. We managed to get reasonable "beds" for the 44 hour journey next to two girls from Birmingham. The journey was not as good as I remember the one five years ago being. Because of all the extra passengers, the boat was a lot hotter , dirtier and generally less pleasant. The food which was just about edible on our last trip also seemed to have got worse and we were both glad of the food we had bought in Jakarta. We survived the afternoon by reading books and sitting out on deck which was far more pleasant than the sleeping section.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 9pm we had three hours of sport to occupy ourselves with. As well as the usual Saturday sports programme on World Service (including England's 23 - 9 win against Wales), all the televisions on the boat had live coverage of Spurs v Southampton in the F.A.Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We eventually got to bed at about midnight.

                After a mainly sleepless night, we spent most of the day sat on deck reading again. The boat got steadily dirtier as most of the passengers seemed happy to keep piling their rubbish on the floor despite the fact that a lot of them were sleeping in the mess that they were creating. The food also seemed to get a lot worse and for tea we were given a single fish head each with our rice. Throughout the day we were constantly chatted to by Indonesians keen to practice their English and also frequently had our photos taken either with peoples children or on our own.
