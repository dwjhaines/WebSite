                We had a few problems changing money but by about 11am we had managed to change enough cash to buy our bus tickets to Mexico City. After tacos for breakfast/lunch we returned to the hotel for showers before checking out at 1pm. We walked to the bus station where we had a wait of about two hours before the bus left at about 3:30.
            </p>       
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus was OK but not nearly as good as the Colombian buses. There was no toilet or video on the bus and not much legroom. The first part of the journey was slow as the police seemed to stop the bus and check our passports about once every half an hour. Two of the stops lasted for about four hours between them with the bus just waiting in a queue of traffic until the police let us all through.

                We arrived in Mexico City at about 2pm - five hours late - and took a taxi from the Eastern bus station to the Northern one. At the Northern terminal we had several choices of bus to catch to Tijuana but again, a problem with money. None of the bus companies accepted visa and cashing travelers cheques would have lost us about 7 - 8%. In the end, we found a bank and I took out about $400 in pesos on my visa card. This not only gave us cash for out tickets and also eased our cash flow problem as it means we can keep our travelers cheques for Australia.
            </p>       
            <p class="diary-text">
                We bought tickets for the luxury bus at $100 each. We got ourselves some take-away food from outside the bus station and by 4:20 were once more sat on a bus. The bus was a lot better than last nights and was also less than half full. We left on time at 4:30.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 30th Nov</span>
                Quite an enjoyable day spent reading and watching the scenery passing by. We had a few stops of half an hour or so for food which has been pretty good since we arrived in Mexico. 
            </p>       
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st Dec</span>
                We arrived in Tijuana at 11 am local time about 45 hours after leaving Mexico City and three days since leaving our hotel in Tapachula. The journey overall had been surprisingly enjoyable and the time had passed remarkably quickly.
            </p>          
            <p class="diary-text">
                From Tijuana bus terminal, we caught a local bus to the U.S. border and at about midday, crossed into San Diego. The border crossing was remarkably easy with not as much as a stamp in our passports.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As soon as we had crossed the border, we found a phone and rang Air New Zealand to see if we could arrange our flights. We were told that there was space on tomorrow nights flight direct to Sydney and within about ten minutes we were all booked on the flight. It was exactly what we had hoped for and we all went into the McDonalds next to the phone for celebratory meals
            </p>

                Getting the bus to L.A. would have cost us $13 each so we decided to hire a car for 24 hours instead. After making a few phone calls we realised that we would all have to go out to San Diego airport to collect it. We got to the airport by train and bus and at 3:30 picked up a "Mercury Sable" - the equivalent to a Ford Granada - filled with electronic gadgets and generally far flashier than we had expected. We started driving up the coast towards L.A. planning to stop for the night at Newport Beach. Our journey was delayed by me hitting a curb and totally wrecking a front wheel on the way but we still managed to get to a hotel in Newport Beach by about 7.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The hotel cost us about $33 due to a voucher we had found in a magazine in San Diego. It was probably the best value hotel room we have had since the start of the trip. It was a top quality hotel with swimming pool, jacuzzi, TV, air-conditioning and all the other hotel luxuries that we have not had since leaving home. Breakfast was also included and the whole lot cost us about Â£5 each for the night
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After our first showers for three days, we went out for an excellent Mexican meal followed by a pint of Bud in a near-by bar. We bought a 12 pack of Coors and returned to the hotel where we spent about 45 minutes making the most of the swimming pool and jacuzzi while drinking our beer. We finished the beer in the room and went to bed at 11:30

                We were phoned by Hertz just after 7 and were told that we could pick up a replacement car from a near-by airport as soon as we wanted. (The one we had was still OK to drive but the spare wheel was smaller than the other ones)
            </p>          
            <p class="diary-text">
                Dave and I went out to the airport where we picked up an identical model this time called a Ford Taurus.

                After a quick breakfast, we checked out and were on our way shortly after 9. We drove through L.A. and into Hollywood. After some confusion, we found the Chinese Theater and parked the car before going out sight-seeing. We spent half an hour looking at the autographs in front of the theater and the stars in the pavement outside. We got back in the car and drove around in the hills above Hollywood where the views were pretty poor because of the smog. After taking photos of the Hollywood letters we drove down to the coast at Santa Monica and along to Venice Beach. We had burgers at the Sidewalk Cafe and then drove out to the airport stopping to buy Christmas cards and paper on the way. We returned the car to Hertz at 3:30 and caught the shuttle bus to the main terminal buildings. We spent about an hour wrapping presents and writing Christmas cards before checking in our luggage. We walked to the post office and sent the cards and packages home and then had a four hour wait for our flight. Unfortunately, the bars were expensive and the duty free shop would not let us have any alcohol until we boarded so we had an alcohol free wait.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The plane left an hour late and as soon as we were in the air, we started taking advantage of the free drinks - all of us ended up quite pissed.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th Dec</span>
                We landed in Sydney at 7am, changed money and booked our accommodation. Most of the backpackers were full so we had to settle for an apartment for $80 a night. We got a taxi to the hotel which was right in the centre. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we walked to Kings Cross for breakfast and to try and find Hoggy. We walked round a lot of the backpackers but no-one had heard of him so eventually we gave up and walked beck to our hotel.
            </p>          
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our room was ready when we got back and it was far better than we had expected. It was fully equipped with kitchen, bathroom, tele and video.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers, Dave and Gary spent the rest of the afternoon watching cricket while Roz and I walked round the shops looking for tents and souvenirs, etc. We bought a four litre box of wine and a case of VB for tonight and returned to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After drinking half the beer, we walked down to Oxford Street where we saw the hotel that we will be staying in over Christmas. We checked that we will be able to leave our luggage there for a couple of weeks and then went to a nearby Thai restaurant with the four litre box of wine. We had an excellent meal before returning to our apartment to finish the beer. After we had been back about fifteen minutes, we all fell asleep through tiredness as opposed to the amount we had drunk.
