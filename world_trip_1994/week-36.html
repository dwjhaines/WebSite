                A quiet day spent mainly lying on the beach. In the evening, I went to Pong's with Biggi and Steffan. It proved to be a highly entertaining evening. After eating, we sat in the garden smoking and drinking with Andrea, a German girl, Kim, a German bloke and Lars from Sweden. At 12ish, the transvestites who work at Pong's apppeared and two of them got off with Kim and Lars. About an hour later, Pong came out in tears, threw down a packet of heroin on our table and told us that he had just discovered that the transvestites had been smoking the stuff for the last two weeks. It was all very dramatic and I sat through most of it all without saying a lot, just getting more and more stoned. There was a lot of confusion as the transvestites walked out, reappeared and walked out again and by this time I was totally confused about what was going on. It did not help that everyone was speaking German and I had just about lost the ability to talk at all.

                By 3am, everything had just about calmed down and we all left to return to our bunglaows.

                I woke up early so decided to go into Na Thon and meet Roz's boat. I arrived there at 9:30 and had almost an hour to wait for the boat. We nearly managed to miss each other but eventually Roz found me and we got the bus back to Palm. We had lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach.

                We had a session in the evening. We ate at Pong's and then walked into Lamai where we spent most of our timein Lugano's apart from when we went to The Mix Bar for the transvestite show. This is a cabaret type thing with several transvestites dancing about and miming to records, which is all quite entertaining when you have had a few.

                Spent just about the whole day sleeping or lying on my bed - not really hungover but worn out and not feeling like doing a lot.

                It was quite cloudy most of the day but I still managed to get burnt by lying on the beach with no sun cream on.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate out with Biggi and Steffan and some other Germans but did not stay out with them, returning instead for another early night.

                We had a couple of hours on the beach in the morning and then went into Na Thon to book our train tickets to Bangkok for next Friday. We also changed money and went round the shops buying fake Levis jeans and t-shirts.

                After eating our evening meal at Pong's, we walked into Lamai for another session. We had a couple of bottles of Mekong at Lugano's and were already pissed by the time we left there. We had another bottle in Mix Bar and then went back to Lugano's. I only vaguely remember being in Lugano's the second time. The next thing I remember is walking back to Palm along the beach at about 6:30am. Roz remembers waking up on the floor in Lugano's at some point so it looks as if we had a couple of hours sleep in there after it closed!

                By the time we got back to Palm, the restaurant was open so we had breakfast before finally getting to bed at about 7:30.

                We got up for lunch at 1ish but did not make it down to the beach until after 4. We ate tea in Pong's quite early and then listened to the sport on World Service for a couple of hours.

                After eating in the evening, we walked into Lamai where we spent about five hours in Bauhaus Bar watching first Man Utd v Leeds and then Liverpool v Bolton in the League Cup Final. By the time the second game had finished it was 1am and we were both feeling the effects of the three bottles of Mekong that we had consumed. We went from there to Lugano's where we met Pong and friends. We had one more bottle of Mekong and walked back along the beach again.
