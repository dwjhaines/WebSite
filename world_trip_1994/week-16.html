                We got up at about 8:30 and walked into the city centre for breakfast. We had decided that Tegucigalpa was worth staying another night in which meant we had a day to spend with not much to do. We spent a couple of hours in the morning walking round banks trying to change travelers cheques into dollars. We managed to change $200 but had to do the rest into Lempiras. We also visited the British embassy  and were told that Guatemala was no more dangerous than anywhere else in Central America.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In teh afternoon, we found a road with loads of souvenir shops and spent several hours walking round looking at t-shirts, wood carvings, etc. WE could not make any decision on what to buy so decided to come back in the morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 8th Nov</span>
                After breakfast, we returned to the shops, most of which were closed. By the time they had opened and we had bought what we wanted, it was gone 11.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel and got a taxi to the bus station. After a wait of half an hour, we got on the 12:30 bus to San Pedro Sula. We arrived there at 5ish and checked into a hotel near the bus station. San Pedro Sula does not have a lot to offer but is a stopover point on the way to Tela where we are heading to tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers, we  went for a walk to the city centre then went for a meal at a restaurant near the hotel.

                We went for breakfast at 8:30 and then walked a few blocks to the bus station. We caught a bus to El Progresso (1 hour) and then another to Tela (1.5 hours) where we arrived at about midday. The weather was bad most of the way to Tela and shortly after we arrived, it started raining heavily. We looked at a few rooms before checking into one close to the bus station for $2 each. We spent a couple of hours walking round the town in the afternoon and in general, Tela seems to be quite a good place. There is an excellent beach about 1km from our hotel, there are plenty of restaurants and we also found a book exchange with more books than we have seen since leaving home.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The only problem with staying here is the weather. It rained on and off during the afternoon and in the evening, we had to eat in the hotel as it was too wet to venture outside. The wet weather meant that there are a lot of insects about, particularly mosquitoes and sand-flies.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had planned to stay here for a couple of weeks before going into Guatemala. However, it now looks as if we will leave the day after tomorrow and head down to the Pacific coast of El Salvador where the weather should be better. We have had very good weather since leaving Cahuita. We had expected some rain - it is the wet season - but when there is no sun at all there is not a lot of point being at the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 6:30 in the evening, there was a power cut so the only light we had for the rest of the night was candles. This seems to be a common problem in Honduras as it has happened everywhere we have been so far. This is the first hotel we have stayed at however without its own generator.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 10th Nov</span>
                We woke up to discover it was still raining and was showing no signs of brightening up. After a split decision and a toss of a coin, we decided to leave Tela and head off to the Mayan ruins at Copan on our way to El Salvador.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for breakfast at the restaurant with the book exchange we had found yesterday and changed eight books for new ones. After returning to the hotel and packing up our stuff, we caught a bus just after 9 o'clock. We had to change buses twice at El Progresso and San Pedro Sula and we eventually arrived at Copan Ruinas at 6:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked into a hotel , found an excellent restaurant for tea and were in bed by about 10.

                After doing our washing and having breakfast we walked 1 km to the site of the Copan Ruins. We spent about an hour and a half at the ruins which were quite good but nowhere near as spectacular as Machu Pichu.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the afternoon, we walked round a few souvenir shops and then returned to the hotel where we read for most of the remainder of the day. We had Mexican food for tea again.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 12th Nov</span>
                We got up at 8, had breakfast and started on our journey to El Salvador. First we caught a bus to La Entrada (2.5 hours) where we had breakfast and listened to the football. From La Entrada, we got a bus to Santa Rosa de Copan (1 hour) and then another to Ocotepeque (3 hours). We had decided to stop here for the night and cross into El Salvador tomorrow. At 4ish, we checked into a hotel where Roz and I got the cheapest room of the trip so far - Â£1.60 for a double.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As we don't have a lot of traveling to do tomorrow, we decided we may as well get drunk tonight. We bought three bottles of run from the supermarket near the hotel and sat up drinking until about 2am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 13th Nov</span>
                We all had hangovers which were to last all day. Dave, Gary and I all went for breakfast and at about 10:45 we all struggled out of the hotel. We had a short bus ride to the border and arrived there shortly before 11. The border crossing was far easier and quicker than the previous two we have been through (even though Roz was sick outside the Honduras immigration office) and by 11:50 we were on the bus to San Salvador.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus journey was hot, dusty and uncomfortable and took nearly four hours and did not help the hangovers at all. When we reached San Salvador we got a taxi to a hotel and although it was expensive ($15 a room) we were all too knackered to go and look for anything cheaper.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went for meals at McDonalds, spent a couple of hours lying in bed, returned to McDonalds and were back in bed by 8:30.
            </p>
