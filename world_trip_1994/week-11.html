                We went to the beach for about 3 hours.

                We spent the morning back at the Olympic swimming pool. In the afternoon we went shopping. Dave, Roz and Gary bought t-shirts, I got a new pair of sun-glasses to replace the ones that Gary trod on this morning (which were only boght in Quito on Monday!) and Dave & Gary also bought hammocks for their expedition around the Darién Gap (Roz and I are flying from Cartagena.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 5th Oct</span>
                We got a taxi out to the bus station and caught the 9:30 bus to Cartagena. The journey took just over four hours. At Cartagena, we got another taxi into the town and checked into a hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers, we went out for a walk mainly to look for a supermarket. We bought four and a half bottles of rum and a load of bread rolls, ham, cheese, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we sat in the hotel garden eating and drinking. Despite buying all the rum, no-one was really that enthusiastic about the session and it eventually died out at about 2 with no-one too pissed.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th Oct</span>
                We got up at 10ish and finished off last nights food for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I went off to look at beaches and other hotels as we plan to stay here for about a week while the others try aand get rounnd the Darién Gap. Boca Grande had a reasonable beach, some very expensive hotels and a couple that were within our price range. We returned to the hotel where we spent the afternoon lazing around and reading.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, after another meal of sandwiches, Roz and I went for a walk around the old town which was very plesant and scenic.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th Oct</span>
                After breakfast, Roz, Gary and I spent about an hour changing travelers cheques. Roz and I then checked out of the hotel and moved to another at Boca Grande. Our new hotel cost about twice as much as the last one but it is a much nicer and cooler room, has a private bathroom and is just across the road from the beach. The resort of Boca Grande is just like a lot of Spanish resorts, two roads lined with restaurants, bars, hotels and souvenir shops. Hardly the authentic Colombia but very enjoyable for a few days.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent most of the afternoon walking around the shops and travel agents. We managed to find a decent second hand book shop for the first time in South America and also booked our flights to Panama for Monday costing us about $140 each. The rest of the time was spent lying in the room reading as it was too cloudy to go to the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, Dave and Gary came down to Boca Grande and we went out for a meal at a nearby restaurant. We then said our goodbyes as we will not be seeing them for at least a week and perhaps longer depending on how quickly they get round the Darién Gap.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th Oct</span>
                The day was mostly cloudy but we still managed to get quite burnt by spending 4 - 5 hours on the beach.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got drunk on the left-overs from Wednesday night's session. We started drinking in the room, had a half bottle of rum in a restaurant and finished off by taking another bottle down to the beach. There seemed to be more people on the beach than there had been during the day. I don't remember leaving the beach or going to bed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th Oct</span>
                I woke up with a slight hangover which didn't really go away all day. We managed to go to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon but didn't do a lot else all day. In the evening we went for a pizza.
