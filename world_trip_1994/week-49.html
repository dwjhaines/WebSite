                We got up at 6 and went straight down to the site entrance. We entered Petra at 6:30 and spent the next seven and a half hours walking round the ruins. The ruins themselves were excellent, especially the treasury and the monastery however, I was more impressed with the views of the whole site and the surrounding scenery. At nearly £20 it was probably the most expensive sight we have ever been to but was also one of the most interesting and spectacular.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 2 o'clock we were both completely knackered and after a long walk out of the site, we were lucky to hitch a lift up the hill back to our hotel. After eating, we collapsed on the bed for the rest of the afternoon.

                The day started off quite well. We got up at 5:15 and were expecting to be picked up from our hotel by the 5:30 bus to Amman. The bus did not turn up but we managed to get a service taxi which was faster and more comfortable and only a bit more expensive. By 8, we were in Amman. We got a service taxi into the cheap hotel area and by 9 we had sorted out our room and were ready to go and put in our applications for Syrian visas. This involved visiting a bank to get the money (each visa costs £35!), a trip to the British Embassy for a letter of approval and then getting back to the Syrian embassy - all of which had to be done by 10:30.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got the money quite quickly and got a taxi to the British Embassy. They took about 20 minutes (and JD7) to issue the letter and by 10:10 we were in another taxi heading towards the Syrian embassy. We arrived there with plenty of time to spare, filled in our forms and were told to come back for the visas at 1:30. We were glad to have got it all sorted out as we plan to travel to Damascus tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a service taxi back to the hotel, had lunch and then returned to pick up our passports.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At the Syrian embassy, when we got to the front of the queue, we were told that they were sorry but our application had been turned down. They gave us our money back but could offer no explanation or reason why we had been refused. For no apparent reason, all our plans had been ruined and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it. There is no way of traveling round Syria so our overland trip had come to an end. We sat at the embassy for half an hour unable to believe what had happened. Our only two options were to travel into Israel and try and reach Turkey from there or to fly from Jordon. We went back to the hotel via a travel agent  where we discovered that we could fly to Istanbul tomorrow morning for JD95. This was not ideal but after a couple of hours of not being able to decide what to do, we thought it was probably our best option. By 5pm we had bought the tickets. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had sorted everything out, we were both in need of a drink. We went out to a bar where we had a couple of beers when we found a shop selling cheap bottles of rum. We took a half bottle back to the room and later went back to the shop for another. It was our first session since The Philippines and a very enjoyable way of ending the day.

                We woke up with slight hangovers but nothing too serious. After breakfast, we got a service taxi to the bus station and from there had a 50 minute bus ride out to the airport. We checked in at 10 and had a two and a half hour wait for the 12:40 flight.
            </p> 
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight was quite enjoyable. They were a bit slow in starting to give out the drinks but once started, they kept them coming quite quickly and we were both feeling quite merry by the time we landed in Istanbul. At the desk for buying visas at the airport we discovered that the cost of a visa had risen from £5 each to £10. We only had one £10 note between us so Roz waited with the passports while I went to collect another from my passport. While the visa man was not looking, Roz managed to get past immigration through a side door so we managed to enter Turkey only having paid half the visa fee but with no entrance stamp. We changed money and left the airport quickly and got on a bus into the centre of Istanbul.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once off the bus we went straight into the nearest McDonalds for a meal before getting the tram down to Sirkeci. We checked into a cheap hotel and went out to a bar for a beer. We walked around the shops for a while before managing to find a cheap bottle of brandy. We drank half of it in our room, went out for a meal and then returned to finish it.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 29th June</span>
                We spent the morning going round travel agents finding out what our options are for our journey home. We also were looking for second hand books and managed to get a cheap Turkey Travel Survival Kit. By about 2, I was totally worn out and feeling unwell so I spent the rest of the afternoon asleep.

                We had breakfast and checked out of our room by midday. We had booked ourselves on an overnight bus to Bodrum so we had about seven hours to kill. We spent the day wandering around the bookshops, bazaars and travel agents again. We found a shop with the Eastern Europe Shoestring guide but were unable to buy it as it was promised to someone else. We were allowed to photocopy sections of it so saved ourselves quite a bit of money. At 7pm we went to the bus office. At 7:25 we were picked up by a service bus and were driven out to one of the most chaotic bus stations we had ever seen. We arrived late for our bus but it had waited for us and we left at 8:15.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 1st July</span>
                We arrived in Bodrum shortly before 11 and after looking at a couple of hotels got a minibus out to Turgotreis. We checked into a hotel and spent most of the afternoon asleep recovering from our journey. In the evening we made use of the hotels kitchen facilities and ate our tea on the roof.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 2nd July</span>
                Spent most of the day on the beach. We got pissed again in the evening. We went out for a couple of beers then cooked our own tea on the roof again. We had a couple of bottles of wine with our meal and then started on the Turkish brandy again. I think we went to bed sometime around midnight.
