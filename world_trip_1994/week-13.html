                We got up at 6 and caught the 6:30 bus to Puerto Limon. There are no supermarkets in Cahuita and we were out of after-sun. We also needed to find cheap alcohol! We arrived in Limon at 8ish and found a supermarket that sold everything we wanted including bottles of rum at $2.50 each (a third of the price of bottles in Cahuita). We changed money and caught the 10 o'clock  bus back to Cahuita. We were back by 11:10 and went to the beach for a few hours. In the evening, we drank a bottle of rum and got pretty drunk.

                Had slight hangovers but still managed to make it to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon.

                Dave & Gary arrived at midday after an eventful journey from Colombia. They checked into the same place as us and have a room over the road from us.

                Dave and Gary made the trip into Limon to stock up on alcohol and food from the supermarket. We spent the day on the beach and started the session at about 6pm. To make a change from rum and coke, we made a "punch" consisting of rum, vodka, orange juice, coke, fanta, coconut milk and pineapple chunks. It was marginally better than the rum and coke! We drank until about 2 o'clock much to the annoyance of the Germans in the room next door.

                We all had hangovers but made it down to the black sand beach by about 1 o'clock.

                We listened to the football results at 10 and then went to the beach for the rest of the day. Dave and Gary started saving money by eating sardines for their evening meal as well as breakfast. Roz and I do not need to resort to such drastic measures. After a couple of cheap weeks in Cahuita, our money should last comfortably until we reach Sydney. We are managing to spend about $10 - $11 a day at the moment and still eat out each night.

                Dave and Gary moved to different accommodation as the owner of the place were we were all staying would not give them the same discount on their room that Roz and I were getting (the owner thought they were a bit strange we discovered later!). Roz and I thought about moving but in the end decided not to bother. We are both perfectly happy with the room we already have.
