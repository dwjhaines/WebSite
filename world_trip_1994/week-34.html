                An excellent week! Samui is one of the best places I have ever been to. It has all the necessary requirements for a good beach resort i.e. cheap accommodation near the beach, cheap food, perfect weather and about the right amount of bars and discos to keep us all entertained without being over developed. We all got drunk on the Mekong on Monday, Thursday and Saturday and spent most of the following days recovering although the severe hangovers that occurred last Sunday were not repeated. We had a shopping trip into Na Thon on Wednesday (which gave Regan the chance to demonstrate his fluency with the Thai language while ordering lunch) but apart from that, spent most of the week lying around on the beach.

                Roz and I will probably spend the rest of our time in Thailand here. We had planned to visit other islands but I don't think we are likely to find anything better than Samui so I can't see much point in moving. We are going to Koh Phangan tomorrow and then on Thursday, Roz goes to Bangkok to meet her Mum for a few days. After that, she will come back to Samui where we will stay until just before we leave Thailand on 8/4/95. Hoggy is going to Chang Mai to go trekking at some point and Regan flies home in just under a week.
