                We spent the morning lying by the pool listening to the final day of the 4th test. By 1 o'clock the match was getting quite exceiting so we went to a bar to watch the final couple of hours on satelite TV. The match finished at 3:30 with England winning by 100 runs.

            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went to The Bali Rock Cafe where they were having a traditional Indonesian Big Bopper Burger Night. This consisted of another all-you-can-eat buffet of burgers, chips, onions, cheese, salad, etc and was excellent value at about Â£2 each. We had a few beers before the meal and a Rubber Duck with our food. The food was superb although by the time we had finshed eating, neither of us was in the mood for drinking a lot - both being too full of burgers. We stoppped for one drink at Peanuts II on the way back to the hotel. We also bought a bottle of brandy on our way back but by the time we were back in the room we were both happy to go straight to sleep.

                We both seemed to have slight hangovers despite not drinking a lot. I was also suffering from the effects of too much chilli sauce last night. Fortunately, it was cloudy for most of the day so apar tfrom a fwe trips to the shops, we spent the day lying around reading.

                We spent the morning by the pool. At lunchtime, we booked ourselves on tomorrow afternoon's overnight bus to Yogyakarta

                We spent our final morning in Bali in much the same way way as we have spent the rest of the week - lying around by the pool, reading. The hotel we have stayed at for the last six days has been excellent with a good room and one of the best swimming pools we have had the use of on the trip so far.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked out of the hotel at 12:00, left our luggage in reception and went out for lunch. The food in Kuta has been excellent, far better than I remember it being when we were here five years ago.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After eating, we returned to the hotel, picked up our luggage and walked to Legian Road to wait for our bus. A shuttle bus took us into Dempasar and from there, we got the 3:30 direct to Yogya. The bus was quite good by Indonesian standards but no-where near the same level of luxury as the Mexican or Columbian buses we have been on in the last six months. The seats were not comfortable enough for easy sleep but we did get two meal stops including an excellent buffet tea.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd Feb</span>
                We arrived in Yogya an hour early at 7am and the bus drove us straight into the Sorso area where most of the budget accommodation is located. We spent about half an hour looking at various hotels which in general did not seem as good as the ones in Bali and were certainly not as wonderful as Lonely Planet makes out. We eventually found a cheap place for Rp8000, checked in and went out for breakfast. After eating, we went for a walk along the main tourist shopping street of Yogya and then spent most of the day finding our way round or lying in the room recovering from the bus journey.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Yogya seems like a good place and there is certainly enough to see and do here for four or five days. However, once more, our plans will depend on the weather. If the rain continues has it has done today, we will probably head for Jakarta next week and will end up leaving Indonesia earlier than planned. If the weather improves we will stay here longer and find another hotel with a swimming pool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had to eat our evening meal at our hotel restaurant as it was too wet to attempt to go any further.

                We got up just after 7 relieved to find that the rain had stopped. After breakfast, we hired bikes (excellent value at about 45p each for the day) and set off to see Kotagedi where most of Yogya's silver industry is based. Kotagedi itself was not as interesting as we had expected but the ride out there was very enjoyable. From there we cycled up to the craft centre which was also pretty poor and back to the centre of Yogya. On our way out to Kotagedi we looked at several hotels with swimming pools just South of the centre, some of which were incredibly cheap. If the weather does stay fine, that is where we will head in a few days time.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In all we cycled about 20km and got back to the hotel by about 12:30. We spent an hour recovering before going out to lunch. After eating, we wandered round the shops again. On the way we got just about talked into doing a one day batik course (which we will probably do on Monday and also booked ourselves on a tour to Borobudur and Prambanan for tomorrow morning.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had seafood pizzas for tea and then returned to the hotel where we listened to the sport on World Service for an hour before going downstairs to watch Forest v Liverpool with three other English couples. We got to bed after the results at midnight.

                We got up at 4:30 and were picked up at 4:45 to start our tour. We were joined on the minibus by five others including a very drunk Canadian.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at Borobudur just before the gates opened at 6 and were given a 45 minute guided tour of the Buddhist temple before having an hour to wander around on our own. The temple itself and the views of the surrounding countryside were excellent and the guided tour was reasonably interesting for a change.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we returned to the minibus we waited for 45 minutes for the Canadian but gave up and eventually left without him. We returned to Yogya via a couple of smaller temples, dropped off the four remaining members of our group leaving Roz and I on our own in the minibus for the second half of the tour to Prambanan. We spent about an hour at the temples of Prambanan which were more spectacular than I had expected them to be and if anything I thought they were more impressive than Borobudur.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The minibus drove us back to our hotel where we arrived at 12:15. After showers and much needed breakfast/lunch, we spent most of the afternoon sleeping.
