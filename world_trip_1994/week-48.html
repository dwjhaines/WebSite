                We kept our room until 10:30pm as our train to Cairo did not depart until 11:30. We were heading for The Sinai but decided that the cheapest and easiest way to make the journey would be to go back to Cairo on the overnight train and proceed by bus from there. This was avoided the expensive ferry or overnight bus on the same route.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the day was spent as yesterday. We walked down to the station at 10:30 and had about an hour to wait for the train. When it arrived, the train was identical to the one that bought us to Luxor. It left at about 12:15

                We arrived in Cairo on time at 8:30. We started walking towards a bus station to catch a bus to Suez but found the service taxi stand on the way. The service taxi was a comfortable minibus that did the journey in about two hours. We arrived in Suez at about 11am and had three hours to kill before our next bus to St. Catherine and Mt. Sinai. We got something to eat and made a quick visit to the Suez Canal. The canal was quite interesting particularly the remains of the tanks from the Egyptian - Israeli war from the early seventies, however, it was not as spectacular as The Panama Canal. At least we can now say that we have seen them both.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were back at the bus station by 1 and our bus left on time at 2. The journey to St. Catherine took about six and a half hours and was very spectacular but pretty hot and uncomfortable, particularly the first four hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped by the roundabout outside St. Catherine at 8:30 and had a 2km walk to the monastery at the foot of Mt. Sinai. There was a hostel attached to the monastery and we left our luggage in one of the rooms before setting off to climb the mountain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We set off at 9:20 equipped with warm clothes, tuna sandwiches and plenty of water for the walk which Lonely Planet described as an easy two hour climb. There was a well defined path most of the way up and it was quite easy to follow even in the dark. The walk up was highly enjoyable. We were the only ones climbing at that time and apart from a couple of coke stalls, we didn't see another person the whole way up. The last half hour of the walk was harder than the rest as we climbed the "steps of repentance" to the top. We reached the small church at the summit just after midnight, ate our sandwiches and went to sleep near a few other people who had climbed earlier. We were lucky to find a pile of blankets which stopped us being too cold and managed to get a few hours sleep.

                We woke at about 5 to find that about 200 people had joined us on the summit to view the sunrise. As the sun came up, we got our first views of the surrounding landscape. The scenery was excellent, probably as spectacular as anything else we have seen on this trip. The views on the way down (all the way by the steps) were also excellent. We reached the bottom by about 8 and tried without success to get breakfast at the monastery. At 8:15, we got our luggage back and started walking towards St. Catherine, 4km away where we would have to wait until 1:30 for the bus to Dahab. We stopped at the roundabout halfway to town for a rest and also to try hitching. The hitching proved useless as there was hardly any traffic so at 9 o'clock we picked up our rucksacks and were about to set off for the final 2km when a taxi stopped. Unbelievably, it was going to Dahab and had two spare seats. We got in unable to believe our luck. The driver did not hang about and by 10:30 we had arrived not only in Dahab but right in the middle of the budget accommodation/restaurant area. We found ourselves a room, went out for lunch and then went to sleep for a couple of hours.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Dahab seems quite a reasonable place. There is not much of a beach but everyone seems to spend their time lying around in shady restaurants with an occasional dip in the sea. It is not an ideal place (not much alcohol in evidence as with most of Egypt) but will be OK for a day or two of doing nothing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we walked around the souvenir shops before eating and having an early night

                After we had eaten breakfast (pancakes with fruit, ice-cream, honey and chocolate sauce), I walked into "Dahab City" to try and find bus times to Nuweiba for when we leave. The walk there and back was quite enjoyable but the city consisted of a couple of shops, a bank and a post office. The bus station was closed with no sign of any timetables.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                When I got back to the hotel, we went out for luch and spent the rest of the afternoon lying in the restaurant reading our books.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had decided that it would be nice to spend another day relaxing in Dahab, however, in the evening, I was offered a lift to Nuweiba for tomorrow morning in a service taxi for only EÂ£10 each. This would save us the hassle of having to rely on buses and seemed too good an offer to turn down. We arranged to be picked up at 7am. We had another excellent meal - the food in Dahab as with the rest of Egypt has been superb - and got to bed by 10:30
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 23rd June</span>
                Our minibus arrived 20 minutes early at 6:40. We were still asleep so had to get up and hurriedly pack and were on the bus ten minutes later. The journey to Nuweiba was fast and comfortable and we arrived there at about 8:15. We bought tickets for the ferry to Jordon for US$32 each, had breakfast and made our way to the port. Passing through the port and immigration was very easy. At each queue we were escorted past all the locals to the front and when it came to boarding, we were also given preferential treatment along with the women and families. We were sat in the air-conditioned section, again with the women and families while the single men had to remain on the crowded upper deck in the sun. We were stuck with a boring Belgian traveler for most of the way but apart from that it was all very easy.

                We arrived in Aqaba at about 4 and spent an hour in immigration sorting out our visas which ended up costing us US$40 each. We got a taxi into the town centre with the other Westerners from the boat and checked into the Petra Hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We wandered around the town in the evening, had kebabs for tea and then looked around the book and souvenir shops before returning to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 24th June</span>
                In the morning we spent a few hours on the beach which was OK but not wonderful. We could not be bothered to do a lot in the afternoon but woke up in time to listen to the Rugby World Cup Final. Had kebabs again for tea.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 25th June</span>
                We had breakfast and lazed around in the room until we checked out at 11. We walked up to the bus station with no real idea about what time buses to Petra left but were lucky to get in a minibus with a group of travelers who were all impatient to get going. They paid extra for the bus to leave without being full and we departed within about ten minutes.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Petra at 1ish and were dropped at a hotel near the site entrance. The four other travelers managed to get a room but Roz and I ended up going back up the hill and walking around for an hour or so before getting ourselves sorted out. We could not be bothered to go into the site today so spent the remainder of the afternoon. In the evening we sat around talking to the other travelers that are staying in the same place as us.
