                We got up at about 8:30, ate breakfast and then visited the bank and the post office before checking out of our hotel and walking to the bus office. At 10:45, the service bus took us up to the main bus station where we got straight onto the 11 o'clock bus to Marmaris. We arrived in Marmaris at 12:45 and spent an hour or so wandering around looking at rooms before deciding to give up. The accommodation was either not very good or too expensive and as we were only planning on staying one night anyway, we thought we may as well keep traveling and get to Selçuk a day earlier than planned. We reached this decision just after 2 and by 2:15 we had managed to get ourselves booked on the 3pm bus direct to Selçuk. We had time for a kebab and were taken back to the bus station for the four hour journey. We arrived in Selçuk, the base for visiting Ephesus, at about 7 and eventually found our way to the Australian New Zealand Pension. We had to wait half an hour for a room, had showers and went out for tea.

                We got up at 8ish and went out to look for another hotel. The place where we were staying was quite nice but we must have had one of the worst rooms in the hotel. It was hot and noisy making sleep difficult.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We found a nicer place just around the corner and moved all of our stuff by about 9. We had planned to have breakfast before going out to see the ruins at Ephesus but were offered a lift by the hotel owner so left straight away. We were dropped at the site at 9:30.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The ruins were quite interesting and very spectacular in places - mainly the amphitheater and the library of Celsius. We spent two and a half hours walking around (along with thousands of other tourists) before being picked up and driven back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the afternoon, we sorted out our money for the next week and spent a couple of hours sunbathing on the roof of the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a couple of beers and a bottle of wine on the roof before going out for tea and had a couple more beers in a bar after eating. We were both quite pissed by the time we got back to the hotel at around midnight.

                We both woke with slight hangovers and apart form eating breakfast we didn't do a lot all morning. At about 1:30, we went out for lunch and then caught a dolmus out to the beach at Pamucak about 7km away. The beach was nothing special but was OK for a couple of hours sun-bathing.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate tea at the same place we had eaten last night and had an early night.

                After breakfast, we paid our bill at the hotel and walked down to the bus station. There was was quite a lot of confusion as to which bus we were going to catch but we eventually got on one going directly to Pamukkale which left at 10am. We arrived in Pamukkale shortly after 1 and Roz spent about half an hour finding us a hotel. We had decided to stay here for three days and got ourselves a decent hotel with a swimming pool to make the most of our last few days of relaxation before beginning our journey home.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking in, we went for a walk around the town and spent the rest of the afternoon lying by the pool.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st July</span>
                After breakfast, we set off to climb up to the travertines that make Pamukkale famous. We made a couple of attempts to climb in the back way but eventually gave up and walked up the road and paid the entrance fee. The pools were excellent. There was far less water running through the pools than there was three years ago and some parts of the hill had totally dried up. However, the remaining pools were just as good to look at and to lie in. We also found an excellent water fall to sit in away from the mass of tourists. After two hours of sun-bathing (and burning) we returned to the town for lunch. We spent the afternoon by the pool and got drunk in the evening. We drank a bottle of wine and a couple of beers before going out for tea and most of a bottle of brandy when we returned.

                A quiet day spent mainly lying in the room recovering.

                We checked out of the hotel at 11:30 and spent the next four and a half hours sitting around the pool. At 4 we had showers and walked up to the bus office where we caught the 5:15 service bus down to Denizli. We had a couple of hours to wait for our bus and used the time to make phone calls and get something to eat. Our bus, heading to Istanbul left on time at 8:30.
