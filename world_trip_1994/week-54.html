                We were both up by 7 and by 7:30 we had checked out of the hotel and set off to start hitching towards Munich. We had a few problems before we had even left Bratislava. Firstly, when Roz went to change our remaining Slovakian money into Marks she was told that it was illegal for foreigners to change back money, which meant that we were stuck with just under £100 worth of a currency we did not really want to be traveling with. I had to go back to the hotel where fortunately the receptionist was able to change most of it into Austrian Schillings for us but we were still stuck with about £5 worth. We then had to get a bus out to the Austrian border. Buying a ticket for the bus proved to be another problem. No ticket machines were working where we wanted to catch the bus and eventually I had to walk to the station and back.

            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had got the bus, walked the 2km to the border and cleared customs, it was already 9:15, not exactly the early start for hitching that we had in mind! The spot for hitching, just inside the Austrian border looked quite good, however, we were stuck there for three hours. When we did get a lift, it was not quite as far as Vienna and we were dropped at a much worse spot with not much long distance traffic and nowhere where it was really safe for cars to pull in. We were still there at 2:30 and were getting fed up with the whole thing having traveled a total of 50km in just over seven hours.

                At this point our luck changed.We got a lift with someone who was going into Vienna. We had decided to accept a lift to anywhere as long as it got us away from where we were stuck. When we did get picked up, the driver went out of his way to take us to the other side of Vienna and dropped us at a petrol station on the main road out to Germany. This gave us a chance to buy a desperately needed drink and within a minute of starting to hitch we were picked up again. This time, the car was going all the way into Germany. Once again, the driver was prepared to go out of his way and said he would take us all the way into Munich, a lift of about 500km.

                We were dropped at the Ostbahnhof at about 7:15. It was a great feeling to have made it especially after it had looked so unlikely at one point. We discovered that the tube cost £1.50 each so walked to the Hauptbahnhof. We decided that we may as well sleep at the station and look for a hotel in the morning. We put our luggage into a locker, changed our Schillings into Marks and headed straight for the Mathäser. We got ourselves a meal and then went up to the beer hall for a few litres of beer. It was highly entertaining watching everyone else getting drunk while we were sober for a change and it was a very enjoyable night.

                We were woken at 5:30 and after half an hour of sitting on the platform, went off to find a hotel. We found a room near the station for 70DM, moved our stuff from the locker and went to sleep for the morning.

                For lunch, we bought a load of food from a supermarket and went and sat in a beer garden for a couple of hours. In the evening we got totally wrecked visiting a couple of beer gardens and then the Hofbrauhaus. As is usual with the Hofbrauhaus, I don't remember leaving.

                We had decided to leave Munich today and start hitching towards home. We left the hotel at about 11 and had another picnic lunch in a beer garden before setting off. We caught the U-Bahn out to the start of the Munich - Nuremberg autobahn.
            </p>           
            <p class="diary-text">
                The hitching did not prove too difficult but everywhere we got dropped, we had to wait 1 - 2 hours for the next lift. We had started at 1:30pm from Munich and by about 11 had made it to a service station just South of Cologne. We were stuck there for a couple of hours by which time it had started getting very cold. The lift we had from there took about three hours to get us about 100km up the road as we had to go via a small village in the middle of nowhere to deliver a load of meat. It wasted a lot of time while we drove around looking for the place, but at least when we were finally dropped off, we were on the right side of Cologne and it was starting to get light again.

                We were dropped at another service station about 60km from Aachen at 5am. We had another couple of hours wait there before being picked up by someone going right through Belgium to Lille in France. We took this lift all the way and decided that we may as well get the train from Lille to Calais.
            </p>           
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were dropped at Lille station just after 10 and had a two hour wait for a train. We had another picnic lunch - our first food in nearly 24 hours before boarding the train and by 1:45  we were in Calais. We got the free bus out to the port and booked tickets for the 2:45 ferry back to Dover.
            </p>           
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 3:30, we were back in England after 53 weeks away. We spent ages trying to get away from Dover but once we were away from the port, we got lifts fairly easily, eventually getting one that took us all the way to Regan's flat in Hove.
