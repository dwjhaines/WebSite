                We got up by 6:30 and by 6:55 we were down at the jetty waiting for the ferry (after saying doodbye to the puppies that had kept us entertained for the last week). The ferry arrived shortly after 7 and about an hour later we were dropped at Parapat where we joined up with our bus. The bus was supposed to leave at 8:15 but after a lot of confusion and driving around in circles looking for passengers, we finally left Parapat at around 9.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The morning part of the bus journey was quite good as we drove round the edge of Lake Toba with plenty of spectacular views. We stopped at the Kings Palace which was pretty uninteresting and also at a waterfall from where again, there were very good views of the lake. We stopped for lunch at Berestagi and then spent four hours on the bus traveling to Bukit Lawang. During this time, the weather was awful and we generally became hot and tired. We arrived at about 5 and managed to get ourselves a room (for Rp4,000) before the rain got us too wet. After a hurried tea, we went to the visitors information centre to see a one hour documentary on teh orangutan sanctuary at Bukit Lawang. It was a surprisingly interesting film which explained how the previously captive orangutans are rehabilitated to look after themselves so they can be returned to the wild.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 28th Feb</span>
                We got up at 6:15 and walked to the office where we had to pick up permits to visit the orangutan sanctuary. By 6:45 we had our two day permitsand by 8 o'clock we had wlaked up to the sanctuary to witness the morning feeding time. We walked with about 50 other tourists up to the feeding platform and then stood around waiting for the orangutans to appear. We ahd been told that we may not see any but were nonetheless disappointed when none of them turned up. Apparently it is now the fruit season and they are more easily able to feed themselves. We walked back to the hotel for breakfast and then walked into the main part of Bukit Lawang where the tourist information office managed to disuade us from taking part in most of the activities that take place in the area. We returned to the hotel to wait for the afternoon feeding time
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 2:30 we returned to the sanctuary, waited from 3 until 4 but still saw no orangutans. Everyone keeps telling us that there were four there yesterday! We will try again tomorrow.

                We got up at 7:15 and once again walked to the orangutan sanctuary. This time we were in luck. We saw three while we were walking along the river to the sanctuary. Once at the sanctuary, one orangutan was on the roof of the office and climbed down to pose for photos for about 20 minutes and then we saw one (possibly the same one) at the feeding station as well. They were all amazing to see so close and it made all the walking and waiting well worthwhile.

                We had planned to leave for Medan today but yesterday evening we had watched a group of people "tubing" down the river past our hotel. It looked like fun so we decided to stay an extra day and give it a go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                For Rp1000 each (about 30p) we were given a large inner tube for the day, the idea being to sit in it and float down the river. After a few false starts and near disasters, we got the hang of it and it proved to be excellent entertainment. We spent about 2.5 hours walking up river and floating down to our hotel again before stopping for lunch and then going for a final visit to the orangutan sanctuary. We saw one more orangutan as we were leaving and then made another two trips down   a 1km stretch of the river on our tubes. Again, it was highly enjoyable. After eating, we went and watched the orangutan film again.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 2nd Mar</span>
                We got up at 6:30, packed and walked to the bus stop where we caught the 7:15 public bus to Medan. The journey was not too bad as we were the first people on the bus so we could choose the seats with the most legroom. It took about 3Â½ hours to reach the bus station on the outskirts of Medan and from there we caught another bus into the centre.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once in the centre, we had to walk 3 - 4 km with rucksacks while we changed money and reconfirmed our flights before finding a hotel. We eventually got a room at a hotel recommended by Regan. We left our luggage in our room and went out to get lunch, stopping on the way to check in for tomorrow's flight at a city check in office. By 4pm we were back at the hotel for much needed showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we spent about an hour walking round Medan, which is by far the worst place we have been to in Indonesia, looking for somewhere to eat before finding a pretty good backstreet curry house. The streets did not feel too safe for walking around at night so we got a becak back to the hotel.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 3rd Mar</span>
                We had an excellent breakfast of martabak and mutton curry before packing our things and getting a becak to the airport.. Our luggage nearly got flown to Singapore but apart from that, we had a fairly uneventful wait for our flight at 1pm. The flight was very enjoyable as we had seats in the executive class section of the plane. Unfortunately it only lasted about 45 minutes and by 3pm local time we had landed at Kuala Lumpa airport. We had just over an hours wait for Hoggy's plane from Sydney and he turned up half pissed from the complimentary beer at about 4:30.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We all got in a taxi to China Town in the centre of K.L. and got a room straight away without any problems. (We had half expected everywhere to be full due to the public holiday)
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_074.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a beer in the room and then went out for a few more and a Chinese meal. We had to postpone the session as the beer was quite expensive and we couldn't find anywhere selling cheap spirits so by 10 o'clock, we were back in our room. We had a couple more beers and discovered that we are sharing the room with a selection of mice and cockroaches.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 4th Mar</span>
                After visiting McDonalds we set off on a short walk around K.L.'s sights i.e. the post office, the railway station and the mosque. The post office was closed so we will have to stay here until Monday to collect our mail. We spent the afternoon at the swimming pool and then returned to the room to start getting pissed again. We had bought a couple of bottles of nasty looking Chinese spirits from a nearby bottle shop and consumed one of them before going out. We went for a pint at the Bulls Head and had a couple more beers with our tea. We then returned to the bottle shop and drank a couple more of the local spirits in the adjoining bar before returning to the room to consume the final bottle. By the time I left the bar, I do not remember a lot and by the time the last bottle had gone, I was totally out of it. We didn't manage to listen to the football results!

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 5th Mar</span>
                I had a slight hangover all day so didn't do a lot apart from eating and walking around the shops a few times.
