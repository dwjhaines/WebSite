                We were awake by 6 expecting to arrive in Medan by 9. By 9 there was no land in sight and we had three painfully boring hours until we finally arrived in the port of Belawan just after midday. We left the boat and headed out through hundreds of taxi and minibus drivers, all keen to take us to a selection of places for far too much money. We had planned to go to Bukit Lawang, a trip which would have involved first getting into Medan and then getting another two buses. Nobody seemed to have any idea how to get to Medan (apart from the expensive taxis) and as we were stood around wandering what to do, a couple from New Zealand spotted a bus at the end of the car park and decided to go and see where it was going. We went along as well and discovered that the bus was going directly to Prapat on Lake Toba. We were planning on going there anyway in a few days time so it seemed easiest just to get on the bus and go there straight away, saving ourselves money and hassle.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The bus left together with us and the Kiwis who were heading for Toba anyway, at about 1:30 and thankfully stopped for lunch after about an hour. We had our first decent meal for two days and were feeling a lot better by the time we got back on the bus. We arrived at Parapat at 6:30 in time for the last ferry to Samosir Island which left at 7. We were both worn out but decided we may as well keep traveling so we would not have to do anything tomorrow. We arrived at Tuk-Tuk on Samosir just before 8 and went with a tout to a hotel that we were keen on going to. We got a room with balcony overlooking the lake for Rp7,000. By the time we had showered and eaten, it was gone 10 and we both went straight to sleep.

                We were awake at about 8 after an excellent night's sleep. We went out for breakfast and also looked at several other hotels. The place where we were staying was OK but we managed to find a nicer room with far more pleasant balcony for Rp2,000 less so we decided to move. At Rp5,000 a night it is the cheapest place we have stayed in Indonesia and also one of the nicest.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours in the sun by the lake before having a late lunch. In the evening we went out for a few beers and also drank a bottle of brandy that we had bought from Jakarta. We were both quite pissed by the time we went to bed but do remember most of the evening!

                We spent the whole morning in bed sleeping off our hangovers.

                The weather was good enough for sun-bathing for most of the day so we spent about three or four hours lying by the lake in front of our room. We also went swimming in the lake for the first time since we arrived.

                We didn't do a lot all day although I did spend a couple of hours walking to and from Ambarita, a small village about three miles away.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we got drunk on a mixture of beer, banana brandy and some other nasty home-brew type spirit.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 25th Feb</span>
                We spent most of the day regretting that we had experimented with the local spirits last night.

                In the morning we booked ourselves onto tomorrow's tourist bus to Bukit Lawang. We sunbathed for a couple of hours before walking around the Tuk Tuk Peninsular looking at book shops and souvenirs.

                Toba has been an excellent place to stay, one of my favourite places on teh whole trip. The accommodation has been good (and cheap) and the food has been as good  as at anywhere else in Indonesia. Even though there has not been a lot to do here  and the weather could have been better, we have had a very enjoyable and relaxing week.
