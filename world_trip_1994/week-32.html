                We got up by 6:30 and by 6:55 we were down at the jetty waiting for the ferry (after saying doodbye to the puppies that had kept us entertained for the last week). The ferry arrived shortly after 7 and about an hour later we were dropped at Parapat where we joined up with our bus. The bus was supposed to leave at 8:15 but after a lot of confusion and driving around in circles looking for passengers, we finally left Parapat at around 9.

                The morning part of the bus journey was quite good as we drove round the edge of Lake Toba with plenty of spectacular views. We stopped at the Kings Palace which was pretty uninteresting and also at a waterfall from where again, there were very good views of the lake. We stopped for lunch at Berestagi and then spent four hours on the bus traveling to Bukit Lawang. During this time, the weather was awful and we generally became hot and tired. We arrived at about 5 and managed to get ourselves a room (for Rp4,000) before the rain got us too wet. After a hurried tea, we went to the visitors information centre to see a one hour documentary on teh orang-utan sanctuary at Bukit Lawang. It was a surprisingly interesting film which explained how the previously captive orang-utans are rehabilitated to look after themselves so they can be returned to the wild.
