                We woke up at midday, packed our things and left the hotel. We got a bus down to Manila and then a train to the area with the cheap hotels. By 4:30, we had checked into a room, collected our luggage from where we left it three weeks ago and changed our flight (for the third time) to tomorrow night.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had hoped to go for an all-you-can-eat Mexican meal but when we arrived at the restaurant, the times had changed and we had missed it by an hour. We had a couple of snacks instead and returned to the Mexican later for an excellent meal. By 9:30 we were both asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 6th June</span>
                We did not have a lot to do in the morning. We changed our pesos back into dollars (at a reasonably good rate), I walked round taking photos of jeepneys but apart from that, we stayed in the room until checkout at midday. After checking out we returned to the Mexican restaurant for the all-you-can-eat taco meal. It was one of the best meals of the trip so far and also one of the best value at just over £2.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 1:45 we were both totally stuffed. We walked back to the hotel to collect our luggage and then got a taxi out to the airport. Our flight was not until 6:30. We checked in at 3 and spent most of the afternoon sitting in the departure lounge. Our plane left just about on time and we arrived in Bangkok just after 8.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had decided to sleep at the airport instead of trying to get into the centre of town. We tried a few spots before finding a quiet spot on the observation deck and settled down for the night at about 12.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 7th June</span>
                We were both awake by 6:30and we walked across the road to the station and caught a commuter train into town. We had quite a bit of difficulty getting a taxi from the station but managed in the end to get a tuk-tuk which dropped us on Khao San Road at about 9.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking into a hotel and having showers, we set off to find out about buying tickets to Cairo. After the first few travel agents we visited, it became obvious that we did not have too many options. Egypt Air fly to Cairo on Saturday night and are a lot cheaper than anyone else (but about £30 more than we were quoted two months ago). We were told by one travel agent that the flight was full and by another that there were seats. We phoned Egypt Air to confirm that there were seats on the plane and returned to a travel agent to book the tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                It was here that our problems began. Egypt Air would not book us on a flight to Cairo without us having onward tickets despite the fact that the Egyption embassey told us that we did not need them. We spent half the afternoon trying to sort out the problem with many phone calls to Egypt Air and visits to the travel agents. It appeared that our only option was to buy a through ticket to London for an extra £33 - not bad value but probably not a lot of use to us - or to try and acquire a visa by tomorrow. We decided to leave it until tomorrow and hope that Egypt Air would be able to sort it out for us.
            </p>

                At 5pm, I went to see a doctor about a cyst on my eyelid which appears to have become infected and is starting to become annoying. the doctor seemed to know what he was doing , gave me antibiotics for the infection and told me he would remove the cyst tomorrow night for me if I wanted him to (for £75).
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th June</span>
                We got up early and went back to the Egypt Air office via the G. P. O. At the Egypt Air office, they appeared to have found the perfect solution to our problem. They would sell us the ticket for a little bit more than we would pay on Khoa San Road and they would ring the embassey and get them to issue visas straight away. This seemed ideal, however, when we phoned the embassey, they told us that a visa would cost us £61. If we wait until we arrive it should be £10. All this meant that it works out cheaper to buy a ticket to London via Cairo than it does to just buy one to Cairo. We returned to Khao San Road and booked the tickets.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the afternoon walking round the shops buying books, passport photos, student cards, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 5 I returned to the doctor to have my cyst removed. The whole operation took about 20 minutes and was much the same as the ones I have had previously. As usual, I was given an eye patch to wear for 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We picked up our tickets during the afternoon and rang the airline to confirm that we are on the flight. Everything looks OK so we should be on our way to Egypt on Saturday night.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 9th June</span>
                We didn't do a lot all day apart from eating and going round the shops again. We bought travelers cheques for our trip back through the Middle East and also bought a few presents/souvenirs.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The patch on my eye proved to be very annoying but it was removed by the doctor at 5 o'clock and I was given the all clear. It was a great relief to get my eye sorted out. (I hope the insurance company agrees!)

                After breakfast, we packed up our luggage and checked out of the hotel. We went for a final look for letters at the main post office and went to McDonalds for lunch. We also stocked up on ham rolls to take to the airport tonght.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 5 we got a minibus out to the airport. Our flight was not until 12:30 but we decided we may as well wait at the air-conditioned airport instead of sitting around in Bangkok.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked in at 10:30 and our plane left about an hour late at 1:30. Egypt Air proved to be one of the worst airlines we have ever flown with. The safety checks and instructions were non-existent, we were both served the wrong meals, the headphones didn't work, etc, etc. Worst of all was the fact that it was a dry airline. However, this didn't affect me as much as Roz as I am still on antibiotics and can not drink anyway!

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 11th June</span>
                We arrived in Cairo at 6:30, changed money, bought visa stamps and then proceeded through immigration with no problems. We took out more cash on visa and by 7:30 we were in the airport car park looking for buses.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had expected it to be very warm but the temperature seemed remarkably cool after Bangkok. We caught a local bus into Cairo without any problems and made our way to a hotel. We had to wait an hour for a room as the hotel was full. The room we were eventually given was excellent with plenty of space and a balcony overlooking much of Cairo.

                After showering we set off to start sight-seeing. We went first to the Egyptian Museum. Most of the museum was pretty uninteresting however, the treasures of Tutankhamun were excellent and made the visit well worthwhile. I had seen the treasures in London in 1972 but was far more impressed the second time around.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After leaving the museum, we got a take-away lunch and went back to the hotel. We had hoped to see the rugby world cup quarter final live in the hotel but at 2pm when we sat down to watch the game, we were told that only highlights were being shown... and not until midnight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After we had given up on the rugby, we had another rethink over our travel plans for the next few weeks. We had planned to spend a few days in Cairo and then start heading East to the Sinai and on to Jordon. However, we were both very impressed with our first day in Egypt and Roz was very keen to go down and see the sights of Luxor. We decided that we may as well extend our stay here and very decisively went straight out and bought the Egypt Travel Survival Kit. We went straight from teh book shop and booked our train tickets down to Luxor for Tuesday night. Our I.S.I.C. cards have already proved well worthwhile. Not only do we get into the sights for half price, we also got discounted rail tickets (second class air-con to Luxor for E£24).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We headed back to the hotel and spent the afternoon reaading up on where we wanted to go.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for "pizza" for tea and had an early night. I got up at midnight for the rugby highlights.
