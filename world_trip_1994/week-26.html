                We woke up to find that it was still pissing down with rain. Because of the weather, we were both unsure as to whether or not we should continue our journey through Nusa Tengarra. We were aiming for Komodo which was still two days away and we would then have to wait at a beach for three days before a 24 hour boat journey back to Bali. After much indecision, we eventually agreed to turn back (and possibly return to Indonesia from Hong Kong or Thailand). We walked to the bus station and then spent about six hours doing the reverse of yesterdays journey, arriving back at Sweta terminal by 4pm. We considered going all the way back to Bali but in the end decided to spend the night where we were.

                We got up early and got a bemo to the ferry port where we had an hour and a half wait before the ferry departed. The journey back to Bali was much better than the one going the other way. We were on a newer boat with air-conditioning and the journey only took four hours. By 2pm we were back in Padang Bai where we planned to stay a few days - again depending on the weather.

                We woke up to find that the sun was shining for the first time in ages. We had a quick breakfast and were down on the beach by 8:30 to make the most of the weather. We had five hours of sun before it clouded over and we spent the rest of the afternoon reading in our room.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 19th and Friday, 20th Jan</span>
                On Thursday we managed to get about two or three hours of sun and Friday was the best days weather since we got here. So far the weather here is better than expected and Padang Bai is proving to be an excellent place to stay. It has a much nicer beach than at Kuta and the cost of food and accomodation is a lot cheaper.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 21st Jan</span>
                It rained constantly all day. We decided to give it 24 hours and wait to see if the weather improves. From tomorrow we will stay if the sun shines in the morning and leave if it is cloudy or wet.

                While we were having our evening meal, we were told by a waiter that there is lilve English football on Indonesian TV every Saturday night. He said it was OK for us to watch on his tele so at 11pm we returned to the restaurant and watched the whole of the Sheffield Wednesday v Newcastle game. It was not a great game (0 - 0) but it was good to be watching live football again and they even had English commentary.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 22nd Jan</span>
                We spent a few hours on the beach during the day and went out for a pizza in the evening.
