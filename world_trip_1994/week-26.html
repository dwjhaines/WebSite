                We had decided that if the weather was good, we would stay in Padang Bai another day but when we woke up, there was no blue sky in sight so we left the hotel and caught the 10am ferry for Lombok
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived at the port of Lembar at 2:30 and got a bemo into Ampenan where we checked into a hotel for a night. There was not a lot in Ampenan but it seemed like a good place to stop on our way to Gili Air.

                After breakfast, we got a bemp from outside the hotel to Rembica and from there a bus to Pemenang. From here we got a cimodo (horse and cart) the final couple of miles to Bangsal. From Bangsal, we had a 10 minute wait for a boat to take us across to Gili Air where we arrived just after 10am.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Gili Air is a small island, less than 1kmÂ² with no mains electricity or running water. WE booked ourselves into a couple of bungalows near the beach and then spent a couple of hours lying in the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we bought a couple of bottles of arak and drank them on our balcony before going out to tea. We were all drinking on empty stomachs and I only vaguely remember laeaving for the restaurant at 8 o'clock. We had a couple more bottles with our meal and I remember nothing at all about the rest of the night. Apparently we went to "Go-Go's" pub after eating and Gary and Regan walked completely round the island before finding their way back to their room.

                We allhad slighthangovers but nothing too bad. We hired a couple of sets of snorkels and took it in turns to go out on the reef close to where we are staying. Both the coral and fish were superb, easily as good as anything I had seen at the places where I have snorkeled before.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather was not really good enough for sun-bathing so most of the way was spent reading on the balcony.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 12th Jan</span>
                A similar day to yesterday. We spent about an hour on the beach in the morning and had a couple more snorkels but apart from that, the rain kept us on the balcony for most of the day. We were given a free meal by the owner of the hotel in the evening to celebrate her new house being built.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 13th Jan</span>
                The torrential rain continued all day, this time with no breaks. We did not do a lot all day until the evening when we had Gary and Regan's leaving session. It was a similar session to the one we had on Tuesday. We got through four bottles of arak and once more, I don't remember a lot after about 8 o'clock.

                Roz spent the whole day in bed with one of the worst hangovers of her life. The rest of us were not too bad. The rain stopped for long enough for us to go snorkeling but the water was too cloudy to see much so it was another day of not doing a lot.

                We had an early breakfast and by 8:15 had walked down to the islands port. Regan and Gary went off on the charter boat at 8:30 to meet up with the shuttle bus to take them to the airport. They both fly to KL via Bali today - Regan to continue his holiday in Malaysia and Thailand and Gary is heading to Hong Kong to look for work. Roz and I booked ourselves on a public boat which was not due to leave until fifteen people turned up (we were the first two).After an hour and twenty minutes the only other people to turn up were five Kiwis. We eventually all paid 1000Rp extra and were taken over in a half empty boat. Roz and I then got a cidomo to Pemenang where we got a bemo which would take us to the Sweta bus station. The bemo took us back to the port from where we had just come, picked up the five Kiwis (who we think had chartered the bemo for themselves) and took us on a scenic drive around the coast to Sengiggi before dropping them off and finally taking us to where we wanted to go. It was a bit of a long way round but the scenery along the way made the diversion well worth while. We reached Sweta by midday and got in a minibus to Labuhan Lombok, the port for the ferries to Sumbawa. We only had to wait about 40 miutes for a boat and the crossing took about an hour and a half. At Poto Tano on Sumbawa, we got straight on another bus, this one taking us on a two hour journey to Sumbawa Besar. We decided to stop here for the night and checked into a hotel near the bus station.
