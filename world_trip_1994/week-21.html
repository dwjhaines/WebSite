                We succeeded in leaving the apartment after finishing off last night's food and set off towards the main road out of Port Macquarie. We walked for about 15 minutes before starting to hitch and then got a lift straight away with Roger who took us all the way to Coffs Harbour and dropped us at a camp site by the beach. The beach at Coffs Harbour was excellent and just a few minutes walk from our tent. We spent a couple of hours on the beach and went for an "all you can eat" Italian meal in the evening.

                After a couple of hours lying on the beach, we walked up the coast a couple of miles to The Big Banana - "Coff's leading tourist attraction". The walk was very enjoyable as were the banana split and banana smoothie. After walking back we spent most of the afternoon sitting in the shade listening to the cricket. In the evening we walked to a pub to watch the second half of the cricket.

                We both agreed that we preferred Port Macquarie to Coff's Harbour so we decided to go back down and spend the last few days of our trip there. After breakfast at the pub, we started hitching South. We had a slow start and a two hour wait 20km South of Coffs but then got two lifts that took us all the way back to the centre of Port Macquarie. By 1:30 we were back at the camp site and had pitched our tent in the same spot that we had last week.

                We spent the afternoon by the pool and had a bar-b-q and about six litres of wine in the evening.

                Another morning of not doing much except lying by the pool. There are pretty good beaches within easy walking distance of the camp site but the pool is so good that we haven't made it to any of them in our time here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for a curry for lunch. By the time we got back, the weather had changed for the worse so we spent the rest of the day watching England getting beaten by Zimbabwe in the cricket while consuming another box of wine.

                After four nights in a row of camping, we decided to move back into an apartment for a couple of nights. We took down the tent and moved back to the same place we stayed at last week. After putting all our stuff in the apartmentwe returned to the camp site to make the most of the swimming pool for the last time. We stayed at the pool until about 3 and then walked to the supermarket to stock up with food and beer for the next couple of days. After a couple of hours sleep, we showered and cooked another curry for tea.

                We spent a couple of hours sun-bathing at Town Beach and then had a similar afternoon and evening to yesterday.

                We left the apartment at about 8:15 and walked to the outskirts of town to start hitching towards Sydney. We had a couple of short, quick lifts but then had two waits of over 90 minutes with only a 20km ride in between. By 12:30 we were only about 60km from where we had started and hot, fed up and ready to give up as soon as we could get to somewhere to stay for the night. However, at 12:40, a truck stopped and gave us a lift all the way to Sydney and dropped us at Kings Cross at 5pm.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We checked into a backpackers and went off to find Hoggy and Gary (who are now both working in the same place). After we had found them (and Telford) we arranged to meet them later and went off to McDonalds for tea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 7:30 we all caught the train into the city centre and headed for the St Patrick pub, where during happy hour, they literally give away beer. We were a bit distressed at 8 o'clock when there was no sign of the happy hour but at 8:45 we were told that between 9 and 10, the beer would be free. After a slow start due to the queues at the bar, there followed an hour of standing near the bar drinking as much beer as was physically possible. No-one remembers a lot after 10 pm but there was another hour of relatively cheap beer before the prices returned to normal. Needless to say, by 11 we were totally wrecked and I don't remember anything about getting back to the hostel.
