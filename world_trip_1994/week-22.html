                After breakfast, Roz and I went into the city to the ANZ bank where we collected the money which had been successfully transferred from Basingstoke. We put most of the money into an account as we were in no condition to sort out travelers cheques, etc. We queued for about half an hour at the post office to collect our post and then went to China Town with Hoggy and Gary for lunch.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                After lunch, Gary went off to work, Hoggy went swimming and Roz and I went back to the hostel to recover from last night.

                We were both feeling better by 6ish so decided to go and have a look at Bondi Beach. We walked along the front which had not changed much in five years and were relieved to find that Mr Yeeros was still open. After a drink in The Bondi Hotel, the inside of which had not changed at all, we bought kebabs and ate them in the park by the beach.

                We checked out of the hotel at 8:30 and walked to The Oxford Koala where we were joined by Gary, Hoggy and Ed by about 10:30. Gary had to work in the evening but the rest of us went to the Thai Flora in Bondi for a BYO meal.

                We settled into a daily routine of waking up at about 10 or 11 with hangovers. Most of our time was then spent lying around the room or by the pool, Christmas shopping or generally wandering round the town. Each evening we would have a few beers in the room while playing cards and then go out for a meal where we would get totally wrecked. On Wednesday and Friday we went to Paddington where we visited a few bars and then went to the pizza restaurant that we used to go to five years ago. On Thursday, Roz and I went to Bondi Junction where we went for a Mexican meal (one of the best meals we have had so far).

                Gary finished work on Thursday by collecting his and Hoggy's wages and literally running away. On Christmas eve, we cooked three chickens and roast potatoes, veggies, etc and had a Christmas meal in our apartment. Just as we were about to start cooking we discovered that our cooker did not work. After two phone calls and a visit to reception we had to move to a different apartment.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The meal was superb. When we had finished we caught the bus down to Bondi where we stayed in the Bondi Hotel until about 3:30. An excellent night out!

                We got up at 10 still not really sober. After opening our presents and having a couple of Bloody Marys to put us in a festive mood, we packed our esky full of VB and headed down to Bondi Beach. We were already quite drunk when we caught the bus down to the beach. The beach was mainly empty due to the rain.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There was however a large crowd of people on one part of the beach, most of them English and there was an excellent party atmosphere. We stayed on the beach until the esky was empty by which time I was totally wrecked and I don't really remember the bus ride back to the hotel. After making idiots of ourselves in the bar I made a few phone calls home and was in bed by 9pm.
