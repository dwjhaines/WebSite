                We woke at 10 and after waiting at the wrong ferry jetty for 15 minutes for the hover-ferry, we caught a bus and train into Tsim Sha Tsui, the area in Kowloon where several travel agents are located. We visited a couple with a list of our inquiries relating to the Trans-Siberian train and also about other alternative methods of getting back to Europe.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Although we had slight hangovers and were not thinking clearly, it soon became apparent that the Trans-Siberian was a far too expensive option and that our best bet would be to go on a three to four week trip around China and then fly back to Bangkok spending five weeks in The Philippines on the way. From Bangkok, we should have more cheap options for getting back to Europe than from Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we had got all the information, we were worn out, still feeling the effects of last night, so decided to call it a day and headed back to Ed's. Ed and Gary got back from work at 7ish and as it was Ed's birthday, we all went out to a local bar where some of his workmates had laid on a surprise party for him. It was a very good night out in an English type bar with pool table and although none of us were drinking much, it was quite entertaining watching some of the others getting progressively more pissed. Ed was given a cake and champagne by his workmates and the evening eventually came to a halt when the bar closed at 2am.

                We woke up too late to make the hover-ferry so after making a few phone calls, we went into Tsim Sha Tsui byt train and bus again. After lunch in McDonalds, we went to a travel agent where Roz and I paid for our tickets to Manila for 18th May. We caught the Star Ferry over to Wan Chai where the three of us left our passports at the Chinese visa office as we have decided to go into China on Friday.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to Ed's by train and bus again (as we still haven't managed to figure out the hover-ferry service) and had a quiet night in the flat.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 12th April</span>
                We got up and successfully caught the hover-ferry to Wan Chai and went to the visa office to collect our passports complete with Chinese visas. It was a bit cloudy for sight-seeing but we caught a tram to the Mid-Level escalators and spent an hour going up and down. We had a meal in a Chinese restaurant - our first meal in Hong Kong that was not a McDonalds - then Hoggy returned to Ed's while Roz and I crossed on the Star Ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui to collect our tickets for The Philippines and Bangkok. We spent half an hour or so in book shops reading travel guides for ideas for our journey home and then returned to Ed's by train and bus.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had another quiet evening in.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 13th April</span>
                We didn't do a lot all day apart from a visit to the Tuen Mun shopping centre in the morning. Most of the afternoon was taken up by sorting out what stuff we are taking on our trip into China tomorrow.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we finished off the Mekong and had a few beers finally getting to bed at 2ish.

                We left Ed's flat at 9:30 and went by bus and train to Kowloon Tong railway station where we met Hoggy who had been trying to find new shoes. We arrived at the train station at 10:30 and spent most of the next four hours standing in queues. It appeared as if half of the residents of Hong Kong were traveling to China for the Easter bank holiday (400,000 people we discovered later). We waited about an hour just to buy a ticket to Lo Wu near the Chinese border. We arrived at Lo Wu and stood for about two hours going through customs and immigration before finally walking into China at about 2pm. We  walked straight to the railway station and had our first attempt at buying train tickets. We got them without too many problems, the only difficulty being the fact that they would not accept Hong Kong dollars despite what Lonely Planet had said. By the time I got back from the bank, all the seats had been sold on the train we wanted to catch so we ended up buying tickets to stand in the 1st Class section. We had a couple of hours to wait so made another visit to the bank to change more money and also ate a meal in the station.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our train left on time at 4:45 and was fast and comfortable. It would have been very good if we had had seats as well but we were relieved to be getting on a train at all. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we arrived in Canton, two hours later, we were totally worn out. We tried to find a hostel near the railway station but the one recommended in the book appeared to have closed down. We were eventually found by a tout who took us back to a hostel about four miles away. By the time we had got there and sorted ourselves out, it was gone 8 and within an hour we were all asleep.
