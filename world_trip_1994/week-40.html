                We went for breakfast at 9 and by 10:15 we were at the bus station. We were met there by the man from the CITS who told someone to make sure we were put on the right bus. He has proved to be the most helpful person we have met in China so far.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our bus came in a few minutes late and after much dithering around and a quick tour of the town, finally pulled out at 11. It was a five hour journey to Louzhou. The trip was not too bad due once again to the bus being half empty most of the time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At Louzhou we proceeded to another very helpful CITS office where we were given our train tickets to Xi'an. We caught another bus out to the railway station and had about an hour and a half wait for our train.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our train pulled out on time at 7:34pm and the journey was due to last about 40 hours. It was our first experience of long distance travel on Chinese trains and it did not turn out too bad. The trains were not as large or as comfortable as the Indian equivalent but were good enough and far better than the buses. The only problem with my birth was the fat Chinese bloke in the bed next to me who spent the whole night snoring not only loudly but in the most revolting way I have ever heard. He kept us awake for a lot of the night but we did get some sleep.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 25th April</span>
                We spent the whole day on the train not doing a lot. We were still feeling ill in one way or another so it was quite pleasant just being able to sit or lie around looking at the passing scenery.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 26th April</span>
                We arrived in Xi'an at 11, on time much to our relief. We attempted to get hold of train ticket to leave for Beijing in two days time but the foreigners ticket office was closed. for four hours for lunch. We attempted to get a bus out to the hotel we wanted to stay at but eventually gave up on that and took a taxi.

            </div><p class="diary-text">
                Once in the hotel, I was able to open my birthday presents and we all had much needed showers.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went across the road to "Mum's Home Cooking Restaurant" for lunch and discovered that the owner could book us train tickets for less money than we would pay and save us all the hassle. We decided we would like to leave on Friday and paid her a deposit for the tickets.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_093.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                As the restaurant was relatively new, the owner was pretty keen to attract customers and no doubt get a good write up in Lonely Planet so she was offering other services such as free laundry and free bikes. We decided to take three bikes for the afternoon and cycled into the centre of the walled city about 4 - 5 km away. We saw the Bell Tower and Drum Tower but didn't bother with the Great Mosque as it cost 15Y to get in. We spent our time instead looking round the souvenir shops before cycling back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went out to "celebrate" my birthday at Mum's with a few bottles of beer. It was by no  means the most alcoholic birthday I have ever had but it was certainly different and quite enjoyable nonetheless.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 27th April</span>
                We got up , had a not very impressive breakfast in the hotel and then set off to see the Terracotta Warriors. We were accompanied by Ian, an Aussie we had met last night and the four of us caught a bus to the railway station and then another up to the site of the warriors. We got off the bus too early so had a half hour walk to actually reach the site. Our student cards once again saved us money on the entrance tickets saving us 40 Yuan.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had heard very mixed reports on how good the warriors were to see so were quite impressed once we got into the main building. The 1000 or so warriors that have been uncovered were in excellent condition and close enough to be able to see quite clearly. We spent an hour walking round the main hall and then visited pits 2 and 3 which were not quite so impressive. After leaving the halls we walked round the souvenir shops which were also very good and we ended up buying cheap bags of warriors for presents.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught buses back to the hotel and had a couple of hours sleep before going to Mum's for tea again.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 28th April</span>
                We collected our railway tickets from Mum's to find that we were on the 9pm train and were spread out all over the train. This was not ideal but it was a relief to actually receive tickets at all. We checked out of the hotel at 12, had lunch and then went to see the Big Goose Pagoda. We caught a bus out to the pagoda and although it was not the most spectacular sight we have ever seen we spent an enjoyable couple of hours walking round its grounds and climbing to the top of it. We caught a bus back into Xi'an and then spent a couple of hours walking round the shops before getting another bus back to Mum's.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a few hours outside Mum's and ate our last meal there. Her food has been excellent while we have been here, as good as anywhere else in China.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 7:30, we got a bus to the station, waited for an hour and then boarded the 9:04 train for Beijing. The train was newer and more luxurious than the last one we were on and also had a much better class of passenger on it. Roz and I were able to swap tickets with the aid of a letter from Mum soo ended up getting births just about next to each other.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The lights were switched off at 10:45 so we were forced to go to sleep.

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 29th April</span>
                The day passed quite quickly. Three hours before we arrived in Beijing, we discovered that one of the tickets we had been sold was not for Beijing and Hoggy had to pay 50Y to conntinue for the rest of the journey. Once in Beijing station (at 4:45pm) we had to pay again as we had Chinese tickets and not tourist tickets. We knew there was a fair chance of this happening so could have no real complaint. It meant however that our journey had cost quite a bit more than if we  had gone to the station for tickets.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi to the hotel recommended by Lonely Planet to find that the only spaces they had were two dorm beds and a bed in a room for four. Roz and I reluctantly accepted the dorm beds while Hoggy took the other. We went to a nearby restaurant for tea. Once more it was very much a travelers centre with English menus, ham and cheese sandwiches and very good food. Beer was down to 10p a pint so we had a few before going back to the dorm to listen to the football.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 30th April</span>
                Roz and I were awake at 6:30 and we sat around in reception until we could get moved to a double room. We were quite lucky in that we had met another couple who had been offered a room in another hotel two floors above where we were. They were looking for a dorm so we gave them our beds and got quickly upstairs to take their double room which was infinitely better than the dorm. We collected Hoggy at 10 and went for breakfast. We then hired bikes for the day and headed off for the railway station to try and book tickets for Canton for the end of the week. It took an hour to cycle to the station. Once there, we found a very efficient foreigners booking office but were unable to book tickets as they only accept bookings five days in advance. We were told to come back tomorrow.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We cycled back from the station to Tianaman Square where we went straight to McDonalds for a familiar looking Big Mac Meal. We then spent a couple of hours walking round the square. It was all quite interesting but a lot of the sights were closed until after May 1st.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were not in the mood for a lot of sight-seeing so decided to cycle back to the hotel, about five miles away. On the way back we hit a huge area of congestion with lots of people stood in the street selling tickets. After a while, we realised we were at a stadium of some sort and managed to establish that a football match was about to take place. We parked our bikes and went to see if we could get tickets. We were swamped by several touts who tried to rip us off before finding someone who spoke English and was prepared to sell us tickets at face value. There was an incredible amount of pushing and shoving as people competed to sell us tickets and the bloke who sold us ours looked as if he was about to come to blows with a few of the others. As soon as we had the tickets in our hands, we legged it away from the scene into the ground to take up our seats. We had paid just over £1 for our tickets and had an excellent view of an entertaining game in which Beijing beat Tianjin 3 - 0.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we had a fondue type dish called Mongolion Hotpot for tea and a few beers before having an early night.
