                We were up by 9ish and went to a nearby restaurant for breakfast. As well as excellent Chinese food, all the restaurants do a full range of Western food so we were able to have bacon, eggs, tea and toast for about 50p each.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent a couple of hours walking round the travel agents and souvenir shops and managed to book our train tickets  (we think) from Guilin to Chongquin for next Saturday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to hire bikes for the remainder of the day and the three of us cycled out to Moon Hill. It was a 30 minute ride followed by a steep climb to reach the top of the hill. The views from the top were fantastic. Every where you looked, you wanted to take another photo. The whole area is pretty scenic but having a 360° view of it from that height was excellent.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After walking down adn cycling back to Yangshou, we had our first beer of the day at the "Hard Seat Cafe". We returned to the hotel for showers and at 6 o'clock went out for our first session in China. We had a few beers while playing cards until 9ish and then went to the Green Lotus for tea. Once again, the food was excellent and we stayed in there drinking until 2am.

                None of us had bad hangovers so by 10 o'clock we were eating steak, eggs and hash browns for breakfast. We spent most of the day buying souvenirs from the shops along Yangshou's main street. We also booked ourselves onto a river cruise  for tomorrow and ordered a snake for tomorrow nights tea.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we went back to Green Lotus for another superb meal. the food here is so cheap you can order anythign you want from the menu and not worry at all about the cost. We had six dishes (including such traditional Chinese dishes as Spicy Chips and Onion Rings), rice and a couple of beers nad the bill was still less than £1 a head.

                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 19th April</span>
                We got up at 8:30 and by 9 had hired ourselves three bikes for the day. We went forr breakfast and by 9:50 were at the CITS office. We were taken from there to the river and shown to our boat. We were on the boat with about eight other backpackers  all with bikes, the idea being to travel up river to Xing Ping and then cycle back.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The trip up-river lasted three hours and was excellent. We had lunch in Xing Ping and then had a thoroughly enjoyable 25 km cycle ride back to Yangshou through very scenic paddy fields and small villages.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After we had got back and had showers, we started on the beer again. We had a few in the Hard Seat Cafe and the Green Lotus and then proceeded to Sisannas where we had ordered our snake. Eating snake proved to be quite entertaining. They produced a live snake for us and let us hold it for photographs before removing the head with a pair of scissors. It was then skinned and chopped up before being stir-fried and served up on a huge plate with lumps of chicken and assorted veg. It actually tasted pretty good and was excellent value at under £5. A group of travelers at another table were having the exotic banquet consisting of cat, rat, dog and frog so we also got to taste a piece of each of those animals in exchange for some of our snake. By the time we had finished eating we were all quite pissed and we ended up going back to the Green Lotus with the other group. I have no idea what time we left there but vaguely remember us all going to the bus station for some reason. I spent the remainder of the night sat up chatting to an English bloke who was waiting for a doctor to come and sort out a trapped nerve in his back and eventually got to bed at 6am.

                Hoggy and I went for breakfast at 11ish and found the group that we had been drinking with still drinking in the Green Lotus. We got a couple of beers and joined them again. The whole of the rest of the day is a bit of a blur in my memory. Roz, who had been ill during the night joined us after a few hours and the three of us spent the rest of the day in our usual selection of bars. I finally got to bed at 111ish.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 21st April</span>
                I woke up at 3am with earache which I think was in some way connected to the cold I have had for several days. The pain was dreadful and seemed to get worse whenever I lay down so I spent most of the next five hours sat up on my bed waiting for daylight. At about 8:30, I went to a pharmacist hoping for some painkillers but somehow ended up being given a head massage. Surprisingly, this did take away the pain to some extent and when I got back to the room I took some paracetamol and was able to get a couple of hours sleep.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                By 12, we had got up, had breakfast and checked out of the hotel. We waited around to collect our fake student cards (which apparently gain you cheap access to sights around China) and then caught a bus to Guilin. We were supposed to pick up train tickets when we arrived in Guilin but when we got to the office, we were told that we would have to collect them tomorrow morning and hour before the train is due to leave.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were shown to a nearby hotel and checked into a triple room. None of us could be bothered to go and visit Guilin's main tourist attraction so we spent most of the remainder of the afternoon asleep (Roz and I are now both suffering from colds and Hoggy is feeling sick most of the time). We went out for a meal at 7 and then returned to the hotel where I took a couple more paracetamol and went to sleep
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 22nd April</span>
                We got up and ate breakfast and then returned to the railway station to collect our train tickets. At 10:30 they had still not been obtained so we sat around in the booking office while people ran around trying to sort the problem out. By 11:30, they had managed to get us two hard sleepers  but had no way of getting a third. They offered us several alternatives but in the end we decided to get our money back and return to Yangshou. As we now had some spare time on our hands, we went out to visit the caves that we had missed out on yesterday, They were pretty good and well worth seeing (and also proved that our student cards were worth the money, saving us more than they had cost). We got back to Guilin station, collected our luggage and got the bus back to Yangshou where we checked back into the "Holiday Inn".
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                At this point, we had a change of plan. The train we would have caught would have taken us to Chongquin from where we had planned to do a two day Yangtze river cruise before catching a train up to Xi'an. As all the problems of traveling in China seem to be connected with buying tickerts, we decided to buy a ticket all the way to Xi'an and miss out on the cruise. The man at the CITS office had appeared helpful on our last stay in Yangshou so we went back to his office and paid for three tickets leaving for Xi'an on Monday or possibly Tuesday (We will find out which day tomorrow).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went back to Green Lotus for tea. Hoggy had a fw beers but Roz and I are still feeling ill and are now on cold tablets.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 23rd April</span>
                I spent just about the whole day in bed trying unsuccessfully to get rid of my cold/flu.
