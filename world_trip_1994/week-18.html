                We left at 8 and started heading towards Guatemala. We caught a bus to Santa Ana (1 hour) another to Ahuachapan (1 hour) and another to the border at Las Chinamas (half an hour). We arrived at the border at 12:30. The border crossing was quite straightforward but involved a lot of walking. Dave carried my rucksack a lot of the way as I was not capable of moving very quickly with it on.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Guatemala at 1pm and had a 45 minute wait for a bus to Guatemala City. We had decided not to stay in Guatemala City so as soon as we got off the bus at 5pm, we got a taxi to another bus terminal and caught our fifth bus of the day to Antigua Guatemala.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived in Antigua at 6 and checked into a hotel near where we were dropped off. We went out for an excellent meal of chicken and chips - a much needed change from the egg, beans, cheese and rice that we were eating at least once a day in El Salvador.

                With the exception of two visits to a restaurant for breakfast and tea, I spent the whole day lying on my bed resting my ankle.

                We went for breakfast at 9 (chicken and chips again), returned to the hotel to pack our bags and by 10 we were on our way to Panjachel on Lake Atitlan. The journey involved three buses and we arrived in Panjachel just before 2pm. Gary and Roz found us hotel rooms and, after checking in, we all had chips for lunch. We spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the town and down to the lake. It seems like an excellent place to spend a few days - certainly the best place we have been for a while. The lake is very , surrounded by hills and volcanoes. The town itself is small with plenty of restaurants and souvenir shops. There are also more tourists and back-packers than we have seen in any place since Cuzco.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                After icy cold showers, we went out to a vegetarian restaurant for tea and looked round a few of the souvenir shops on the way back to the hotel.

                Dave, Gary and I walked round to the next two villages on the lake Santa Catarina and San Antonio Palop√≥. It was a very enjoyable walk with good views of the lake and surrounding volcanoes. We walked a total of 22km and were totally knackered by the time we got back at 3:30ish.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we had our final session before beginning the long trip North to L.A. We got through a couple of bottles of local spirits before tea. Tea consisted of a few snacks bought from street stalls. We had a couple of drinks in a bar with a happy hour and then returned to the room for another bottle of rum. We managed to smash another bottle at some point though I don't remember this happening. I think we all went to bed at 1:30.

                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 25th Nov</span>
                Woke up with a hangover from the session and with stiff legs from the walk not to mention a few mystery cuts and bruises on assorted parts of my body. Spent most of the day lying in bed feeling sick.

                We did our washing and ate breakfast while listening to the football (Swansea were hammered at Wrexham). Roz and I went down to the beach to sunbathe when the football finished but gave up after less than an hour as it clouded over. This was probably for the best as my nose is swollen, blistered and pussy after getting severly burnt during our walk two days ago.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the rest of the day was spent walking round the many shops and stalls in the town buying souvenirs and Christmas presents. We ate out at various snack stalls in the evening.

                We left Panachel at 7:45 intending to travel as far as the Mexican border at El Carmen before starting our three day marathon bus trip to L.A. tomorrow. We are now sure that we want to get to L.A. and change our flights to arrive in Sydney as soon as possible. If we can't change our flights, then we will spend a couple of weeks in The States before continuing as planned.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The first bus we caught took us to the Pan American Highway where we had a five minute wait for a bus to San Marcus. From there, it took another two buses and we arrived in El Carmen, a small town literally on the border at about 2pm. We had planned to stay the night in El Carmen but after viewing the available accommodation, we decided to cross the border and head for Tapachula 14km into Mexico.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The border crossing was fairly straightforward and after changing money, we got another bus to Tapachula where we checked into a hotel just after 4pm
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After showers, we went out to find details of buses to Mexico City for tomorrow and ate an assortment of tacos for tea.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When we leave tomorrow, we intend to travel non-stop at least until we reach Tijuana. This should take about 72 hours with the bus journey from Mexico City to Tijuana taking up about 48 hours. We will then get the next available Air New Zealand flight to Sydney and could in theory be there as early as next Saturday.
