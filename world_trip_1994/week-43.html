                Roz and I managed to ring PAL and change our flights so that we leave Hong Kong for Manila on Saturday. We phoned the Philippine embassey to get their address and then set off to apply for our visas. We caught bus and tube to Hong Kong Island and then handed in our passports at the embassy togeter with US$30 each.

                We got a tram along to the Macau ferry pier to find out times of boats for our day trip to Macau on Thursday and then walked back to the Star Ferry Terminal stopping at McDonalds for lunch on the way. We crossed to Kowloon and spent about half an hour reading Lonely Planets at a bookshop working out our route home. We had planned to fly to Istanbul via Cairo but are no thinking of just flying to Cairo and traveling overland via Syria and Jordon. We were given the idea by someone in Beijing and having read the Middle East Lonely Planet, it all seems quite feasible.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to Ed's by train and bus and apart from cooking a spaghetti bolognese fro tes, did not do a lot for the rest of the day.

                A quiet day spent mainly writing letters and postcards. Roz and I walked to Tuen Mun and back while Hoggy went into Kowloon to try adn book a flight back to Australia.

                Roz and I caught the 8:30 hover ferry to Central and walked to the main post office. We took our collection of t-shirts, presents and souvenirs and spent about £20 getting the whole lot shipped home. We walked from there to the Philippine Consulate where we collected our passports and then went to Victoria Peak Tram Station. We had a 20 minute wait for Hoggy who arrived at 11 and the three of us caught a tram up to the top of the peak. The views from the top were pretty good but it was still not really clear enough to see a long way.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked down the other side of the hill and caught a bus to Aberdeen. We had lunch at McDonalds and then went to the harbour. We were immediately approached by someone selling tours and haggled a price for a half hour tour. The boat trip around the harbour was well worth doing. particularly the second half when we were taken round the older house boats.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a bus back from Aberdeen to Central. Hoggy went back to Ed's while Roz and I went back up the Mid Level Escalators to buy more souvenirs. We crossed back to Kowloon, changed money (Philippine Pesos), bought malaria tablets and a couple of books and then returned to Ed's We got back at around 6 by which time we were both totally worn out..

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 11th May</span>
                Roz, Hoggy and I went to Macau for the day. There was nothing in particular in Macau that any of us wanted to see but as it is another country (more stamps in the passport) and not far away, we thought we may as well. 
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We caught the hover ferry from Ed's to Hong Kong Island and then walked down to the Hong Kong - Macau ferry terminal. We bought tickets for the 9:30 high speed ferry and boarded the boat with ten minutes to spare. The boat journey took two hours and was uneventful.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once in Macau, we caught a bus into the centre and quickly got our sight-seeing out of teh way. We walked up to the ruins of the Sao Paulo Cathedral which were quite good and then visited the fort which was next door. There was nothing else we wanted to see so we decided we may as well spend the rest of the day eating and drinking.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                We found a restaurant which served reasonably priced African Chicken (the Macau speciality) and had a couple of bottles of wine with what turned out to be an excellent meal.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were all feeling slightly light-headed when we left the restaurant and our next stop was a supermarket to buy a five litre bottle of revolting white wine for about £5. We also bought paper cups and then proceeded to the main square where we spent a couple of hours on a bench getting totally wrecked.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                No-one really remembers a lot after about 4pm when we had to catch a bus back to the ferry terminal. I remember getting on the bus but nothing at all about buying tickets, getting on the boat or the boat journey itself. Apparently we had to be woken up when the boat arrived in Hong Kong and I required assistance to fill out my arrival card.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had arranged to meet Ed, Gary and some friends of theirs from work in a pub in Kowloon. There was a lot of confusion getting to the pub but eventually we arrived there pissed out of our minds while they were all stone cold sober. We stayed in there for quite a while, not drinking a lot and eventually got taken home by Ed at about 1:30

                We did not have anything to do today so spent our time lying around with hangovers.

                Roz and I got up at 6:30 and at 7 o'clock were driven to the airport by Ed who had the use of a company car for the night. We were at the airport by 8 which gave us enough time to visit our seventh Hong Kong McDonalds before we had to check in.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Our flight left on time at 11:10 and we arrived in Manila just after 1. At the airport, we phoned a hotel to book a room and then left to catch a "Jeepney". The jeepney which seems to be the main mode of transport in Manila took us to a LRT station where we caught a train to within ten minutes walk of our hotel. After we had had showers, we went for a walk around the area near the hotel and found a florist to send flowers from Stewart to his girlfriend who lives in Manila.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we walked round quite a few restaurants before settling on one doing Philippine food. The meal was not particularly good however, a lot of the slightly more expensive ones doing Western food did look a lot better. Manila seems not a bad place for a few days of eating and drinking and I think we will spend more time here later in the trip. By the time we got back to the hotel at 8:30, we were both completely worn out and I was asleep before 9.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 14th May</span>
                We checked out of the hotel at 10ish and left one rucksack full of unwanted clothes, etc in their left luggage room.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked back to the train station where we caught the LRT  out to the BLTB bus station. We were heaeding for Lake Taal and after some confusion over buying tickets, were pointed to a bus going roughly in the right direction. The bus journey took abotu an hour and a half. Ther ewas more confusion over where we were to get off the bus but once the other passengers knew where we were trying to get to they were all very helpful. Once off the bus, we had two short jeepney rides to get us down to the lake. We checked into Rosalina's Hotel and went to walk around the town of Talisay. The area around the lake was al lvery pleasant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were hoping to find some other back-packers to share the cost of a boat trip out to Tall volcano but it appeared that we were the only Westerners in town. Undecided about what to do, we returned to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We ate at the hotel and once again had an early night although we had to wake up for 45 minutes at 12:15 to hear the final matches of the football season on World Service.
