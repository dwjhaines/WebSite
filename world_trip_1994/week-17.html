                At 9am, we walked to the post office to send the letter and cards that we couldn't post in Honduras because of a postal strike. We changed money and had breakfast on the way back. Breakfast consisted of a couple of pupusas each (tortillas filled with eggs,, beans, or cheese) costing about 2 colones each. We walked back to the hotel, packed our bags and then walked to the bus stop for buses to La Libertad. The journey took about an hour and we arrived at La Libertad at about midday. After looking at a few hotels, we eventually found quite good accomodation for about $3 each.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were hoping to spend a couple of weeks in La Libertad to make up for Tela. Here the weather is exellent. However, the "black sandy beach" described in the book does not seem to exist. What beach there is, is stoney and totally unsuitable for sun-bathing. No-one felt like doing a lot so we decided to wait until tomorrow and then go and look at the places a few km along the coast before deciding how long to stay here.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had more pupusas for lunch and then Gary and I went for haircuts which seemed to take up most of the afternoon.

                We had breakfast at 9ish and then started walking Westwards from La Libertad in search of a good beach or swimming pool. After half a km we found a hotel where we could use the swimming pool free in the hotel restaurant. Most of the food was expensive, however, the breakfast was affordable and we decided we may as well return tomorrow if we can't find anything better. From the hotel we caught a bus to the Atami Beach Club which the book highly recommended about 20 km away. We walked from the main road up to the club to find the entrance fee had gone up from $0.25 to $5 - out of our price range.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the main road and caught another bus about half way back to La Libertad to a village we had spotted when we were heading the other way. There was a beach here but it was not very nice and the black sand was too hot to walk on. We did not spend long on the beach before going to a near-by hotel and paying just over $1 to use their swimming pool for the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                A lot of the afternoon was spent discussing various possibilities for the next month. We have 30 days until we are due to fly out of L.A. but do not want to spend much time in Mexico due to the high prices. This means that even if we spend a week in Guatemala we will still have a spare 10 - 14 days to spend somewhere. The main options seem to be spend the time in America or New Zealand or to arrive early in Australia. Arriving early in Australia seems the most appealing however, this is dependent on us being able to change the date of the flight from L.A.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We didn't reach any decision  other than to stay here a week and see how long it takes us to get to L.A.

                Both days were spent in the same way. We walked to the Hotel Arcos, about 1km away. Here we paid about $3 each for breakfast which entitled us to lie around by the pool  - most of the time in the shade as it was too hot in the sun. At about 3:30 - 4:00 we returned to our hotel for a couple of hours before going out for tea. (Roz was too ill to go for tea on Wednesday and was still not 100% by Thursday evening)

                We had to go into San Salvador to change money and decided to visit Los Chorros Pools in the same trip to avoid having to stay in San Salvador again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got up at 7 and caught a bus into the capital. After breakfast, we changed money and then Dave and Gary went to the post office while Roz and I went to the tourist information office to find out about Lake Coatepeque. The Lonely Planet had said it was possible to stay free at the lake in government accommodation usually provided for government employees. We didn't really expect to get it but at the tourist info office, we were given the address of the office to which we had to apply. (All you ahve to do is ask according to the book!) It took us a taxi and two bus rides to find the office, but once there, obtaining the permit could not have been easier. We simply said where and when we wanted to go and within about ten minutes, we were issued with a piece of paper allowing us to stay in a cabin for two nights from tomorrow. Unfortunately, the whole place is closing for a month from Sunday or we would have stayed longer.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time all this was sorted out, it was about 11:30. We caught a bus back into the centre and another out to Los Chorros. Los Chorros is supposed to be one of the highlights of El Salvador, however, we were not particularly impressed. The pools were not very clean and the area surrounding them was not very comfortable for lying in. We stayed a couple of hours and then Dave and Gary returned to La Libertad and Roz and I went back into the centre to visit McDonalds again before going back.

                We left at 6:30 to try and ensure that we arrived at Coatepeque in time for the football results. As it was, the journey took less time than expected and despite having to catch three buses, we were at the lake by 9:00. The accommodation was excellent considering it was totally free. We had a four bed cabin with private bathroom and a balcony area for sitting on. The complex had a large swimming pool and a cheap restaurant. After listening to the football (Swansea 2, Stockport 0) we spent the rest of the day lying by the pool or reading in the bedroom.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 20th Nov</span>
                Another quiet day spent mainly by the pool or lying in the bedroom.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On our way to the restaurant in the evening, I fell over damaging my ankle. I initially thought it might be broken but it appears now that it is just sprained or twisted.
