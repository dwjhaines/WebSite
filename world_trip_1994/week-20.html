                After breakfast, we went round a few banks changing money and then walked to Kings Cross to try and buy a second hand tent. We could not find one anywhere so we walked back to the city and bought a new one for $46. This took up the whole morning and it was lunchtime by the time we were back at the apartment. After lunch, Roz and I went out to find out about vaccinations and on the way bumped into Hoggy at the post office. He was on his way to work so we arranged to meet him in a pub when he finished (12:30 am). Spent the rest of the afternoon walking round the shops and also went to Circular Quay to look at the opera house, etc.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we drank the remainder of the beer and a box of wine while watching videos and at midnight went out to the pub to meet Hoggy. We stayed there a couple of hours by which time we were all pretty pissed. Hoggy came back and stayed at the apartment. I fell asleep almost as soon as we got back.

                The first part of the morning is not too clear as we had to check out of the apartment at 9:30 at which time we were still drunk.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I left to catch a train to Gosford from where we intended to start hitching up the coast for a couple of weeks. Dave and Gary went back to Kings Cross with Hoggy. Dave is going to the cricket today and will start hitching across to Perth tomorrow. Gary is going to spend two weeks looking for work or lying on his bed doing nothing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Roz and I caught a train from Martin Place to Central Station and from there another to Gosford. At Gosford, we were still quite a way from the freeway and were advised to take another train to Ourimbah. From Ourimbah station we walked about 1km to the Pacific Highway and started hitching at 12:50. The hitching was pretty slow all day mainly due to the fact that the places we were being dropped at were not very good for stopping traffic. There was plenty of traffic but it was ll going past us too quickly. We had six lifts none of which took us any great distance and then our best lift of the day which took us 125km to Taree where we arrived at about 6pm. Just across the road from where we were dropped was a pub advertising double rooms for $20 and as neither of us felt like going any further, we checked in for the night. Taree proved to be an ideal place to stop for the night and was only about 85km from Port Macquarie, the first place we were planning to stop.

                After showers, we went out for kebabs for tea and then sat in our hotel bar watching England getting beaten by Australia again.

                We left the hotel at 9 and walked a couple of km before starting to hitch. Our first lift took ages and 2.5 hours after starting out, we were a total of 4km away from our hotel. By this time we were fed up and were considering giving up for the day. Our next lift however was going all the way to Port Macquarie.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We found an excellent campsite with swimming pool, free barbies, etc for $12 per tent. After pitching the tent we went to the pool for a couple of hours. On our return we found that the tent had blown down so we moved to a slightly more sheltered spot and pitched it again.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we bought burgers, sausages and a four litre box of wine and made use of one of the barbies.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 8th Dec</span>
                Spent just about the whole day lying by the pool. We had another bar-b-q in the evening - again accompanied by a four litre box of wine.

                It had started clouding over and trying to rain yesterday evening and by this morning, the sky was totally grey and it was raining quite steadily. We did not want to leave Port Macquarie but decided that it would not be pleasant having to spend the whole day in a tent which was not likely to be very waterproof. We decided to move elsewhere and spent about an hour looking for alternative accomodation evetually finding an apartment just around the corner from the campsite for $30 a night.

                The apartment was remarkably cheap and had two huge rooms with fully equiped kitchen and bathroom. After loading up the fridge with VB we spent most of the afternoon lying around reading, etc. We cooked tacos for tea then stayed in the apartment drinking the VB.

                Another day of not doing a lot. The weather was still bad though it did brighten up for long enough for us to go out for a walk in the afternoon. Had tacos and VB again for tea.

                We had intended leaving Port Macquarie this morning but after eating breakfast and packing the rucksack, we changed our mind and decided to stay another day. Once again we didn't do a lot all day. During the afternoon we watched the cricket and then cooked a curry and had another cask of wine.
