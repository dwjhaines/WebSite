                <span class="diary-date">Monday, 3rd April</span>
                As usual after a session, we did not do a lot all day.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 4th & Wednesday, 5th April</span>
                Two more quiet days spent mainly lying on the beach and reading.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 6th April</span>
                Again we spent most of the day on the beach. In the evening, we ate at Pong's and then went into Lamai for our final session as we leave Samui tomorrow. We had only planned to have a couple of bottles and be back by 1ish but by the time we got out of Mix Bar at 1:40, going to Bauhaus for Arsenal v Sampdoria and a third bottle seemed more appealing than walking home.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left Bauhaus at 4ish and walked back to Palm stopping to say goodbye to Pong, etc on the way. We had a joint when we got back and eventually got to sleep at about 5.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 7th April</span>
                Instead of the usual day in bed following a late night session, we had to have breakfast, pack and be out of the room by midday. We had lunch over the road from Palm and then caught the bus into Na Thon where we had a wait of just over an hour for the boat to Surat Thani. The boat journey was not too bad considering the hangover and we arrived in Surat Thani at 5ish. We were taken by bus to the railway station where we had another wait of just over an hour for the train to Bangkok. The train was excellent and by 9 o'clock we were lying on comfortable bunks and were both asleep about ten minutes later.

            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 8th April</span>
                We were woken at 5 and arrived in Bangkok's main station at 6:30 ish. We left our bags in left luggage and walked two or three miles to the Grand Palace. The gates opened at 8:30 and we spent about an hour wandering around. Although we had been before, it was still well worth another visit. 
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked from the Grand Palace to Khao San Road where we had breakfast and went round a couple of travel agents to get some idea of prices of flights to Europe (We don't know yet whether we will go home by train or if we be flying from Hong Kong or Bangkok). We caught a boat long the river back to China Town and then walked back to the railway station where we collected our luggage and got the train out to the airport.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had about three hours to wait for our flight during which time we stocked up on duty free Mekong and vodka to add to the bottles we had bought earlier.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight was only about two and a half hours but we managed to get through eleven cans of beer between us so were both quite pissed by the time we landed. We were met at Hong Kong airport by Gary who took us by taxi and ferry to a pub on Hong Kong island where we met Gary and Hoggy (something obviously wrong with that sentence but that is what it says in the diary!). Roz and I only stayed for a couple of drinks due to the high prices before getting a taxi back to Ed's flat. We spent a couple of hours talking to Stuart, Ed's flatmate and finally crashed out on the floor at about 4.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 9th April</span>
                We got up at 11ish and headed straight for the McDonalds which is handily situated inside the Gold Coast Complex where Ed lives. We had our first burgers since leaving Malaysia and were then given a guided tour of the rest of the complex.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                Most of the afternoon was spent sitting around playing games and generally not doing a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening we got a fridge full of beer which is remarkably cheap when bought from the supermarket and watched the F. A. Cup semi-finals live from England. By the end of the second game we had got through quite a lot of our duty free bottles as well and were all quite pissed.
