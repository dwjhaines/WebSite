                A quiet day spent recovering and watching the cricket. In the evening we went to Kings Cross for a curry and a few drinks.

                After watching England's traditional batting collapse we caught a train to Circular Quay and spent a couple of hours sight-seeing. We caught a ferry to Darling Harbour where we had lunch and a pint and then went back to the opera house for photos, etc. In the evening Roz and I went for a walk around Bondi and then met up with Ed and Hoggy for a Thai meal on Bondi Road (Gary has stopped going out as he has run out of money)

                We had our first night off the beer since moving to the Oxford Koala. We had an evening meal in aa pub with a couple of drinks and then went back for an early night.

                Roz and I went shopping for souvenirs in the city centre and at Bondi Junction. We had to spend over £100 on malaria tablets and another £30 on postage to send our souvenirs and photos home.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided that today was the day to go on a Rocks pub crawl. Hoggy, Ed and I went by train to Circular Quay at 4:30 and went to a few pubs until we found one with a good happy hour. Roz joined us at 7 and we went to a couple more before attempting to find something to eat. We caught a train to Kings Cross but finally ended up in a Thai restaurant on Oxford Street.

                Roz and I caught the train to North Sydney in the afternoon and then walked back across the harbour bridge. When we got back, all five of us had a few beers in the room and then went to Paddington for pizzas.

                Our New Year's Eve celebrations started in The Tea Gardens at Bondi Junction at 5:30pm. They were having a happy hour so we stayed there until 7 and then went down to Bondi where we had reserved a table at The Thai Flora. We had an excellent meal and about five litres of wine and by the time we reached The Bondi Hotel we were well on our way to being pissed.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent five or six hours at The Bondi during which time we kept losing Gary who was busy chatting up as many girls as possible and also lost Ed who inevitably ended up on the dance floor. It was another excellent night out and we eventually got back to the hotel sometime between 3 and 4.

                We got up at 9:30 and after a quick Bloody Mary we loaded up the esky and headed off to the SCG for the first day of the third test match. It was a highly enjoyable day out with entertaining cricket, good weather and plenty of beer. We walked back to the hotel via a couple of pubs and then went to Paddington for a pizza.
