                We spent most of the day recovering from the last couple of days. The weather was terrible so apart from a shopping trip to Bondi Junction, we hardly left the room. In the evening, Roz and I went back to Bondi Junction for a Mexican meal.

                We got up before 6 as Gary, Roz and I were due to fly to Bali at 9:30. We left Hoggy in bed but Ed came to the airport in the taxi with us as he is flying back to Hong Kong a couple of hours after our departure. We were at the airport by 6:15 and queued for about 30 minutes to check in. We waited around with Ed for a while, made a few phone calls and went through to our departure gate with about an hour to spare. Our flight was delayed getting in from Melbourne so we did not get going until about 10:30.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                The flight was quite enjoyable with the three of us making the most of the free bar. We were all quite merry by the time we touched down in Bali at 1:30 local time. We were greeted by Regan who had been waiting about an hour and a half.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The four of us got a taxi into Kuta and then walked to the hotel where Regan was staying. After checking into a room for three, we sat around chatting, etc before heading for the nearest bar. We stayed there for a couple of hours and then returned to the hotel for showers. We went out for tea at the same place that Roz and I had eaten every night of our stay here five years ago. After eating, we had a couple more drinks then Roz and I returned to the hotel while Regan and Gary went to a few more bars.

                Roz and I were awake quite early so we left the others asleep and went for breakfast. We spent most of the morning listening to the cricket on an Australian radio station. After Regan had finally got out of bed at about 1pm, he and Gary went off to find out about flight options for Gary who needs to get to Hong Kong as soon as possible to start looking for work. Roz and I spent a couple of hours on the beach which is only a two minute walk from our hotel. Gary eventually decided to stay in Indonesia for two weeks and will fly to Malaysia with Regan.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We decided to have a session tonight as in two days time we start traveling again. We had a beer with our meal at our usual restaurant and then walked to Legian where there were several bars having happy hours. (We stopped in a more expensive restaurant along the way as Regan and Gary assured us that the first bar we were going to did not have tables and chairs and they wanted to play cards. They had been in there last night and due to being totally pissed had failed to notice seating space for about 100 people!)
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We started off at Peanuts II which served half price beer until 10pm. When that one finished, we went to The Bounty (where Roz and I had watched England v Belgium in 1990) which had 2 for 1 drinks including excellent cocktails until midnight. It was hardly a traditional Indonesian night out but was a good night nonetheless.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 5th Jan</span>
                Fortunately it rained for most of the day so we were able to lie around in the room listening to the last day of the cricket and recovering from last night without having to worry about going to the beach.

                Regan and Gary left on the 9am tourist bus to Ubud. Roz and I had been before and had no great desirre to return so we will meet up with them again tomorrow.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent about 3 - 4 hours on the beach and the rest of the day reading or looking around the shops. We walked down to the beach again in the evening but the sunset was not as wpectacular as it is supposed to be at Kuta. After wandering round the shops for a while, we ate at our usual place.

                We got up at 8ish, checked out of the hotel and walked to "Bemo Corner" where we caught a public bemo into Dempasar. We arrived in Dempasar just before 9 and I then spent over two hours trying to find a timetable for the Pelni ships. Roz stayed at the bus station while I walked first of all to the place where the Pelni office was supposedly located. I could not find the office but a travel agent directed me to another bus station and told me that this was where the office had moved to. I had to get a bemo out to the bus station but once there, there were only ticket agencies, none of which could give me the timetable. One woman, who spoke English gave me the address of the Pelni Office which was in the opposite direction to the one I had just come in. I got another bemo back to where Roz was waiting and then set off to walk the two miles to the office. By the time I found the office, I was worn out and totally soaked in sweat. After a bit of confusion, I managed to obtain a complete, barely legible, photocopied timetable. I got another bemo back to Tegal station and by about 11:10 we were on our way again. We were heading for Lake Batur and had arranged to meet Gary and Regan at Gianyar at midday. By the time we arrived in Gianyar, three bemos later, it was 12:30 and they had already gone. We caught another bus to Penelokan where we met a tout who was trying to get us to stay at a hotel on the lake. It was pouring with rain at the time so we went for something to eat and eventually manage to convince us that the others were staying at hos hotel. We got yet another bemo down to the lake and found Regan and Gary waiting to greet us.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After checking in, Regan, Gary and I paid for a guide to take us up Gunung Batur tomorrow morning. In the evening, we played cards and ate in the hotel restaurant.

                We were woken at 3:30 by our guide and Regan, Gary and I set of with a group of about eight other people to climb the volcano. The aim, as with Mt Bromo, was to reach the peak of Gunung Batur in time to see the sun rising over the rim of the outer crater. The walk was probably the most difficult I have been on. The side of the volcano was steep and slippery and doing the walk in total darkness did not help. The views from the top of the surrounding area were excellent and made the walk well worthwhile. After the sunrise (which was not as good as the one at Bromo) we walked down via a series of smaller craters, stopping en-route for a breakfast of boiled eggs and bananas which were cooked in one of the volcano's hot fissures.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived back at the hotel and after breakfast and a much needed shower, we were all on our way again. We left at 10 and, after a bus and three bemos, arrived at the port of Padang Bai about four hours later. Padang Bai is the port for ferries to Lombok and also has an excellent beach. Gary spent the afternoon asleep while the rest of us walked to the beach which turned out to be one of the best we have been to so far.
