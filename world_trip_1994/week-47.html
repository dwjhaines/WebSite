                We got up and had breakfast before 7 and got a minibus out to Giza and the site of the pyramids. We entered the site just before 8 and were the first tourists there. Walking round the pyramids really was fantastic and being there with no other tourists made the experiance all the better. We spent an hour or so walking around and also went into the centre of the Pyramid of Cheops. We walked down to the Sphinx and sat in a cafe overlooking the pyramids - one of the best views I have ever seen. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi away from the site down to Saqqara, the site of the original step pyramid and several other attractions. We were dropped by the ticket office and had to walk in to the site - hard work in the midday heat. We looked around the funerary complex containing the step pyramid. It was all quite interesting but no-where near as spectacular as what we had alreaady seen this morning. We got back to central Cairo by a combination of walking, a lift in a van,  two minibuses and a packed city bus. We had lunch and then spent the rest of the afternoon asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 6 we got up and went back to the pyramids for the sound and light show. This was also a highly spectacular display - well worth seeing.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 13th June</span>
                We stayed in our room until 10:30 and then reluctantly checked out. We left our luggage in reception and set out for more sight-seeing.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We went first to the Citadel by bus. This was also an excellent sight. We wandered round the Mohammed Ali Mosque which was better than Lonely Planet made out and the views of Cairo from the Citadel walls were fantastic. We even saw the pyramids for the last time.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got a taxi form the Citadel to the Khan-al-Khalili, the ancient bazaar. It was highly enjoyable walking round the shops and markets.We stopped for cups of mint tea and ended up buying three papyrus pictures.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon sat around in the tele room. We went out for tea at 6:30 ish and at 8 departed for the station.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were booked on the 10pm train and had about an hour to wait before it pulled into the station. The train was excellent. It was fairly new with air-condtioning, reclining seats and plenty of leg room. I went to sleep at about 12:30.
            </p>

                The train arrived in Luxor at about 8am and we were taken with Mr Ibrahim to his hotel by car. We got an air-conditioned double room for £E14. We went out for breakfast and then spent a couple of hours walking round Luxor and along the East bank of the Nile.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time we got back to the hotel, we were both worn out and it was starting to get very hot outside so we went to sleep for the afternoon. We went out for lunch at about 4 and then at 6 went out to visit Luxor Temple. It was another excellent sight. We walked around the temple and then sat outside it waiting for it to be lit up before going arouund again. We left the temple at 8 and went back to the hotel, stopping for tea along the way.

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 15th June</span>
                We got up at 6 to make an early start to our sight-seeing of the West Bank. The staff at our hotel had been trying to get us to go on a tour of the isghts by air-con minibus which sounded quite good value, however, we had decided to try and do the tour on our own by hiring our own taxi for the morning. This was we could see the sights we wanted to and spend as much (or as little) time as we liked at each one. As we were leaving the hotel, they tried again to sell us the tour. When we said we wanted to go by taxi they said that they could organise one for us for £E45 which we eventually agreed to.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had an excellent morning of sight-seeing. We visited the Rameseum, the Valley of the Kings, the Temple of Hatshepsut and the Temple of Rameses III. The first and last of these sights were not on our hotel's tour but were both well worth seeing particularly the Temple of Rameses III. Both featured excellent statues, columns and walls covered in hieroglyphics. At the Valley of the Kings we went into the tombs of Queen Tausert/Sethnakt, Amenophis and Horemheb. All of them featured again superb hieroglyphics and were fascinating to visit. The Temple of Hatshepsut was also very spectacular and the landscape both here and at the Valley of the Kings was truly amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By about 11 we had seen everything we wanted to and were driven back to catch the ferry. By 11:45 we were back in our air-conditioned room. All in all our tour saved us about E£23 and we saw more and probably enjoyed ourselves more than if we had gone on the hotel's tour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We went out for lunch and then had our usual afternoon sleep - it really is too hot to do anything else.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 5, we got up again and headed down to the Nile for our sunset felucca ride, another of the recommended highlights. The same bloke from our hotel who had sorted out our taxi this morning also had a "brother" who had a falucca. He arranged the trip for us for £E30. This trip was also highly enjoyable. It lasted about two hours and, apart from the stopover at Banana Island which caused a slight disagreement with the captain, it really was another fantastic experience.

                We got up at 8:30 and moved to The Shady Hotel, just around the corner from where we had been staying. There are very few tourists around in Egypt so hotels like the Shady which normally would be out of our price range are having to offer huge discounts. We have a large air-conditioned room with bathroom, balcony and T.V. and the hotel has an excellent swimming pool. A double room in the high season would cost US$38 - we are paying about £7.20.
            </p>

            <p class="diary-text">
                After five days of hectic sight-seeing we spent the day lying around by the pool or in the bedroom when it became too hot.

                We got up before 6 and caught a bus to the Karnak Temple, the only sight of Luxor that we still wanted to visit. It was another excellent temple and the two hour walk around it was was made all the more enjoyable by the fact that we were the first ones in there so it was almost totally deserted.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We got back to the hotel by 9:30 and had falafal for breakfast. We then had another day of lazing around by the pool or sleeping in the room.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After our evening meal, we returned to the Karnack Temple for the 90 minute sound and light show. The lights were very spectacular however, the whole thing did go on a bit in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 18th June</span>
                Our sight-seeing completed, we were able to spend the day lazing around the hotel. We only left the hotel for meals and to go round the souvenir shops in the evening.
