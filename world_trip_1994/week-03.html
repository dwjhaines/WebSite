                We spent the morning walking around the area surrounding the town.

            <p class="diary-text">
                At lunchtime, we went looking for bottles of soft drink and somehow managed to end up buying two 5 litre bottles of wine. These were consumed in the evening along with two bottles in the restaurant with our tea.

                The whole day was spent trying to recover from the after effects of last night's wine. We took our rooms for another night despite the fact that we were leaving for Potosi at 7:30pm and spent nearly the whole day lying on our beds doing nothing. Roz and I were not as badly off as the others who had all been on the red wine. Gary and Dave were both sick.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After an excellent meal at about 6:30, our bus finally left at 8:30.

            <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 10th Aug</span>
                The bus journey to Potosi was not as bad as expected and we all managed at least some sleep.We arrived at 5:30 but stayed on the bus until we were kicked off at 6:45. It was freezing cold when we got off the bus so we got a taxi into town and went to the hotel recommended in the book. This was full as was all the other decent hotels in the town and we eventually ended up in a youth hostel type dorm for $2 a night each.

            <p class="diary-text">
                Potosi is at over 4000m above sea-level and all of us were feeling the effects of altitude sickness which combined with the cold meant another day of lying around not doing much. We were all a bit undecided about plans for the next couple of days so decided to sleep on it and see how we feel in the morning. We had pizzas for tea but had to wait 2 hours for them.

                We were all suitably recovered by the time the alarm went off this morning to embark on a tour of the Potosi Co-operative Mine - the main reason for stopping in Potosi. The recommended English speaking guide to the mines works for the travel company attached to our hotel. We had a quick breakfast and set off with about 10 other tourists/travelers just after 9am.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
                En route to the mines, the mini-bus stopped for us to buy presents to give to the miners. Sticks of dynamite were 30p a go so we bought a couple of these and three bags of cocoa leaves.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After a short talk about the mines we were taken inside one. The difference in temperature inside the mine was incredible and the intense heat combined with the natural gases inside the mine made breathing virtually impossible. Dave had to come out after about an hour as he was having severe breathing difficulties. We spent about three hours underground going down two levels and generally getting in the way of the miners who all seemed quite happy with their dynamite, etc. The visit could hardly be described as enjoyable as the combination of heat and gases made moving about very hard work. Roz and I came out about ten minutes before the tour had finished and were very relieved to see daylight again. Despite the effort involved, it was an excellent tour - well worth doing.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once back at the hotel, we managed to get rid of Gary's "fake" $20 notes. We had explained the problem to Eduardo, our tour guide, and after consultation with a friend, he agreed to take the notes although we were still left unsure as to whether or not he considered them to be genuine.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had paid for our room for a second night so we could lie around doing nothing for the rest of the afternoon. At 6:30, we left to walk to the bus station where we got a bus at 7:30 heading for La Paz. The bus was warm but uncomfortable and I didn't get any sleep until after a puncture stop at about midnight.

                The bus arrived in La Paz at 5:30 but we were allowed to stay on it in the bus station until 7:00. We walked towards the centre and after looking at a few hotels, settled for another room for five for $25 per night. After an expensive but much needed breakfast of egg and ham sandwiches we headed off into the town centre where we changed money and sorted out bus tickets for Monday. The views of La Paz as we walked back down from the bus station were excellent. We have decided to stay here for three nights to give ourselves a chance to recover from our altitude sickness and the overnight bus journeys we have been on recently. On the way back to the hotel, I picked up the first set of photos of the trip so far.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the rest of the day lying around in the room or walking around the town sight-seeing. Lunch consisted of an excellent four course meal for under £1 and tea was steak and chips for just over.

            <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 13th Aug</span>
                We got up at 8ish and I went out and bought ten of the worst salteñas we have tasted so far for breakfast. Dave, Ed and I all had to do our washing and by the time we had all finished, it was time to start looking for World Service on the radio for the first day of the football season. We spent about two hours sat outside in the hotel garden listening to the radio. The weather was better than we have had so far on the trip, a remarkable change from the last few days. After the excitement of the football results we went off for another four course lunch and spent a couple of hours walking round the sights. The witches market was the most interesting spot. There was a fine selection of goods on display including llama's fetuses and dead cats. Unfortunately, photography was not really allowed and the witches put curses on you if you try taking pictures.

                We had decided to have a few drinks in the evening and had intended to go to a Peña, an evening of Bolivian folk music. We started drinking at 6:30ish and by 9:00 had got through six bottles of wine between us (just over £1 a bottle and pretty good wine). We set off in the direction of the Peña and stopped for a meal on the way. In the restaurant, we had half a chicken and chips for just over £1 each and had a couple of bottles of beer with the meal. By the time we had finished our meal a party of about 30 Bolivians in the restaurant started playing traditional music on guitars and pipes. We decided we were better off  staying and listening to the authentic music rather than paying to get into something put on mainly for tourists. We had several more beers and after a very enjoyable evening, returned to the hotel at about 1:30.

                We didn't wake up until about 10:00 by which time it was already hot enough to sit out in the sun. We had breakfast of ham, cheese, tomato and onion rolls and then spent a couple of hours sun-bathing in the hotel garden. We went for another four course meal for lunch and spent most of the afternoon lying around in the room either reading or sleeping. Roz and I went back to the markets at 4ish where I bought myself a Bolivian duffle bag for our trip to Rurrenbaque tomorrow.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After showering we went to the top floor restaurant of the five star Plaza Hotel, admired the view and the prices and then returned to the same place we had eaten last night.
