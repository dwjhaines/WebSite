                We got up at 9ish aand bought a load of bread, ham, cheese, etc for breakfast and for the 18 hour journey we had lined up. We were heading for Rurrenbaque from where we planned to do a tour of the jungle in the Amazon Basin. We got a taxi to the bus station at midday and the bus left on time at 1pm.

                The author of the Bolivian Lonely Planet book rated the La Paz - Coroico road, which formed the first four hours of our journey as being in the top three most terrifying roads in the world. For the first hour or so, we could not really see why as we climbed away from La Paz and then started descending on quite wide surfaced roads. The views were excellent although we did not get the best of them as we were on the wrong side of the bus. After about an hour we crossed into another valley and suddenly we were traveling on a road barely wide enough for the bus with a sheer drop of over 1000m to look out on. The road wound round the mountain for 80km in which time we descended 3000m. The frequent crosses along the side of the road kept reminding you that fatalities regularly occurred along the road. Although frightening, it has got to have been the most spectacular bus journey I have ever been on.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After passing Corioco, the scenery was less dramatic and by 7ish it had become totally dark. Sleep was just about impossible due to the standard of the road, the frequent stops and people getting on and off though we all managed to get a couple of hours.

                We arrived in Rurrenbaque an hour and a half early at 5:30 in total darkness. We walked the two blocks down to the main square and sat down in a park bench waiting for daylight to appear. Opposite where we were sat was the town's "5 star" hotel. On enquiring, we found it was only Â£10 a night to stay there and by 7 o'clock we were in the rooms. It was not what you would normally expect from a 5 star hotel but was luxurious compared to the places we have been staying in. We went out for breakfast, managed to book oursleves on a 3 day jungle tour starting tomorrow (for $40 instead of the expected $100) and were back in the hotel, asleep by about 9.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We got up at midday and after lunch spent the afternoon lazing around the hotel garden and walknig around the small town centre.

                We checked out of our hotel at 8:30 and walked round the corner to the starting point of the tour. By 9:00, us plus five others had assembled and we were taken down to the river Beri where be boarded a motorised dug out canoe for the first leg of the tour. We were introduced to Carmen, our cook, Willie the driver of the boat and tour guide who was later to become known as Rambo. A leisurely day was spent travelling up the river until we reached our campsite at about 3. During the journey we were constantly having to get out of the boat to drag it through sets of rapids due to the low level of the water. it was all very enjoyable until we were told to get back into our long trousers and shoes and the boat got stuck again. Gary and I had to jump in and help the guide getting our shoes and clothes totally soaked in the process. I was already less than impressed with the guide.

            <p class="diary-text">
                When we arrived at the camp, it was all set up much better than we had expected. There were wooden beds set up and we were all issued with mattresses, sheets and mosquito onets. Roz and I even had a double to ourselves. The first evening was spent listening to Rambo giving us details of our next couple of days activities and also recounting heroic tales of saving tourists from bears, etc. He didn't speak any English but one of the girls in the group acted as a translator. Most of what he was saying seemed to be made up to try and impress us. We had a pretty good meal for tea and all went to bed by about 9.

                Woke up quite early suffering the effects of hundreds of sand-fly bites picked up from one of yesterdays beach stops. After breakfast we headed off on our jungle trek which was not particularly exciting. We didn't see any animals and most of the time was taken up with Rambo showing off his jungle exploration skills. How much of this was necassary was hard to tell but he certainly seemed to be going over the top.
            </p>              
            <p class="diary-text">
                We were supposed to spend the afternoon fishing but Rambo disappeared "to look for bait" and did not return until 6ish. Instead we spent a very enjoyable afternoon lazing around in hammocks generally doing nothing. 
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                When Rambo returned, he looked completely stoned and took us for an hours fishing on a part of the river he had previously told us contained no fish. By this time I was feeling less than 100% and didn't feel like eating or doing a lot. I went to bed at 8ish missing tea and the evening jungle walk. Roz also missed the walk which didn't sound particularly exciting though we did miss seeing a jaguar cub.

                The first half of the day was a total waste of time. We were supposed to be building rafts to get us back to Rurre but it seemed to take ages to pack up and eventually get going. We set off down river stopping at another camp along the way to pick up six more people who were also returning to Rurre. By the time we left the second camp it was getting on for 11. Rambo then took us down river for about 10 minutes before dropping us all off at a small beach with very little shade but hundreds of insects. We were stuck there for two hours with no water while he went off in the boat to gather materials for the rafts. By the time he returned, none of our group were particularly enthusiastic about raft building so most of us sat and watched the other six do all the work.

            <p class="diary-text">
                I was feeling gradually worse the longer we were stuck on the beach and only started feeling better when after a couple of slices of water melon we finally got going. The rafting was excellent and just about made up for the long wait. We had two rafts with eight people on each one though we were lucky enough to have Rambo steering ours for most of the way. Our raft almost broke in two after about the second set of rapids and emergency repairs were needed. However, we managed to survive for a couple of hours and only Gary managed to fall in totally.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                At 3pm we had to get back into the canoe and were taken back to Rurre.

                We spent most of the day lying around doing nothing. On returning form the tour yesterday we had booked into the hotel owned by the tour operator which was excellent value at $2 each per night with breakfast. The hotel had a shaded garden with hammocks which were ideal for generally lazing around. In the morning we listened to the cricket and football from England (Hull 0, Swansea 2) and the rest of the day was spent generally doing nothing. My not feeling 100% turned into a case of the runs - nothing too serious but I seem to have totally lost my appetite.

                We had planned to leave Rurre today but while on our jungle tour, a visit to the Pampas had been highly recommended. We got our bus tickets changed and booked ourselves on a one day tour for $20. We set off at 8:30 with three others and had about a three hour minibus ride to the small town of Santa Rosa. We had an early lunch, a quick game of bar football and were then taken to a small river where we boarded another dug out canoe.

            <p class="diary-text">
                We then had a fantastic 3 - 4 hour trip along the river. The river was much narrower than the one we had been on before so we were within a few metres of both banks. The wildlife was superb all the way along with hundreds of turtles, dolphins, crocodiles and huge birds everywhere you looked. The diifference between this tour and the previous one was incredible. The crocodiles were within a metre of the boat in some places and our tour guide spent half the trip trying to catch one with a lassoo. Quite what he planned to do with one once he caught it we did not know but no-one seemed to bothered when he failed. He did manage to catch a baby one which was about 18 inches long and which we could all hold for photographs. The guide also seemed to take a great delight in getting as close as possible to the bigger crocodiles and hitting them on the head with an oar from the boat.

            <p class="diary-text">
                After the boat trip we were taken to a lake where we could swim and play volleyball with the locals. After much needed refreshments we set off on the three hour journey back eventually arriving just after 9.
