                We got up at 6 and within about half an hour had caught an out-rigger fromWhite Beach to Caticlan on the island of Panay. We were heading South towards Iloilo where we were hoping to catch the 6pm boat to Cebu. Once again, we had excellent bus connections all the way and arrived at the port of Iloilo by about 1 o'clock. At the port we bought our tickets for the boat and were told we could board the boat immediately. Although there were five hours before the boat left, we did not have a lot else to do so we went aboard and found our bunks. The boat was quite clean and comfortable - better than we had expected for economy class.
            </p>  
            <p class="diary-text">
                We left the boat briefly to stock up on food for the fifteen hour trip and then spent most of the rest of the day lying on our bunks. The boat left on time at 6.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th May</span>
                We arrived in Cebu an hour early at 8am which was quite a relief as we had been awake since 5:30. As the boat came into the port, we were met by about 20 beggars in small boats who would all jump into the water to retrieve coins as they were thrown from our boat. It was a highly entertaining sight.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Once we were off our boat, we walked round the harbour until we found a boat that was due to leave for Tubigan on Bohol. We got straight on it and left Cebu at 9am.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The crossing to Bohol took about two and a half hours and we then spent an hour and a half traveling by bus from Tubigon to the Chocolate Hills Resort near Carmen. We checked into a room (with a superb balcony overlooking the hills) and had much needed showers followed by snacks in the restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The hills around the resort were spectacular although most of them were more green than chocolate colour. The resort is built on the highest hill in the area and there were great views from the highest point reached by climbing 215 steps. After we had walked down from the top, I was totally worn out and went to sleep for the rest of the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked to the top again for sunset before having a surprisingly good meal in the restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Wednesday, 31st May</span>
                We got up at 5:10 to climb the hill again, this time for sun rise.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                After going back to sleep for about three hours, we had breakfast, packed our things and started heading back to Cebu. We had planned to stay at the chocolate hills for two nights  but apart from looking at the hills themselves, there wasn't a lot to do there.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked down to the main road  by 11 o'clock and got a jeepney back into Carmen. In Carmen, we got straight onto a bus to Tubigon. We were still on the bus two and a half hours later despite it being a 20 mile journey. About two thirds of that time, the bus was stationary while rice, flour, passengers and an assortment of other cargo were loaded and unloaded on and off the roof. By the time we had got to Tubigon and walked to the ferry pier, we caught the 2pm boat with about 15 minutes to spare.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The crossing back to Cebu took just over two hours and by 5, we had checked into a hotel about a mile from the port.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In the evening, we had a couple of beers in a bar near the hotel and went to Shakey's Pizza. Shakey's is quite a famous chain in The Philippines. We had a party size pizza (for 4 - 6 people) which was excellent.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Thursday, 1st June</span>
                We had a cheeseburger for breakfast and by 9 we had set off with a list of things to do. We first of all got a jeepney out to the Equittable Bank, the only bank that allows you to withdraw money on a credit card with no commission. We took out what should be enough money to last us for the next two weeks and then started walking towards the shipping offices to buy tickets for the trip to Manila tomorrow. We were given a lift to the office in a lorry which saved us most of the walk. We bought two tickets for "economy deluxe" (economy with air-con) for 500 Pesos each.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We walked from the port to the post office and then got a jeepney out to the newer part of town. We tried unsuccessfully to get hold of a Thomas Cook rail timetable and travelers cheques at the Thomas Cook office, We stocked up on food for tomorrow's boat trip and visited McDonalds for the first time in The Philippines. We got a jeepney back to the hotel, went out to get passport photos of ourselves and then just had to get our flights changed before we had completed everything for the day. This took a lot longer than it should have done, involved six or seven phone calls and a visit to the PAL office (which had moved since our book was written.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time this was all sorted out, we were both ready to start drinking. We drank a bottle of rum in the room and then went out and found an excellent little bar selling beer for 9 Pesos a bottle. We spent the rest of the evening in the bar, in the burger bar across the road and back in the hotel with more rum. It was a really good night out and we were both totally wrecked by the end of it.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Friday, 2nd June</span>
                We got up at 7:30, both of us feeling pretty rough. We went out for yet another burger for breakfast and then got a taxi to take us out to the port. We boarded the ship at about 8:30 and were immediately very relieved that we had paid the extra 36 Pesos to travel in the air-conditioned part of the boat. We had to walk through the non air-con section to get to our births and it was like an oven - not an ideal place to spend the day with hangovers!
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The air-con section was very comfortable and we spent just about the whole day lying on our bunks recovering from last night. We had tuna rolls for our meals as we did not want to leave the air-conditioned room to queue up for free meals.
            </p>

                The boat arrived in Manila a couple of hours late at 9am. It took us an hour and a half to get from the boat to the Filipino Rabbit bus station a few km away. We first of all got in a jeepney that took ages to get out of the port, spent ages dropping people off and then tried to rip everyone off. We eventually got out and took a taxi the rest of the way. There was a McDonalds near the bus station so we had meals in there before continuing our journey. After eating, we got the bus to Angeles and took a jeepney out to the hotel we wanted to stay at.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had showers then spent an hour walking round the area near our hotel looking at restaurants and trying to find out details of trips to Mt Pinatubo, the main reason for visiting Angeles.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The weather over the last couple of days has been awful and once again we may have to change our plans because of it. We had planned a week touring North Luzon but are not sure that it would be worth it in the rain. Angles would also be a lot better if it was not raining.. Our hotel has a pretty good swimming pool which we are unable to use due to the weather and we don't know how much of Mt Pinatubo we will be able to see if we can get on a tour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We spent the afternoon in our room watching tele, had another excellent meal in the evening and then watched the rugby world cup until 1 am.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th June</span>
                We got up at about 9:30 and set off to try and get ourselves on a tour of Mt Pinatubu. After spending two hours going round various hotels on foot and by jeepney we eventually found a travel agents that dealt with the tours. The tours they offered looked very good and were reasonably priced. However, because of the amount of rain we have had in the last few days, they were not able to get to the volcano and did not consider it safe to visit anyway. The situation is unlikely to change until the next dry season.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We returned to the the hotel and decided that we would definitely cancel our trip to North Luzon. It seems pointless to travel all the way up there when the wet season is already starting to affect the roads and sight-seeing in the rain would not be much fun anyway. We now plan to travel to Manila tomorrow and try and fly to Bangkok on Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We started drinking again at 4. We had a couple of beers in the Fawlty Towers Bar, just outside our hotel and then started on the rum again. We went out for tea at about 7:30, had a couple more beers and then sat up until about 4 watching the rugby world cup again. We got through a bottle and a half of rum as well as the beers sand had a thoroughly enjoyable night.
