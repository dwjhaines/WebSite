                The bus was supposed to arrive in Cuzco at 5am but thankfully, due to the many breakdowns it didn't get in until after 8. We caught a taxi to a hotel near the centre where we checked into two rooms despite having to pay over $10 each. After a much needed breakfast, we spent the rest of the morning walking round the various tour agencies finding out details of Inca Trail tours and flights to Araquipa. Roz and I were planning to go on a tour starting on Wednesday while the others planned to do the walk independently. Eventually they decided it was too much hassle and we all booked ourselves on a 4 day trip costing $60 each. We also booked flights to Araquipa for $39 each for next Monday. By the time we had written and posted a load of postcards and sorted everything else out, it was 5 o'clock. At 6, we went to the Cross Keys pub which was having a happy hour.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We all started drinking rum and coke - a double cost about 60p. Ed, for some reason suggested we should have six doubles each during happy hour so by 7 o'clock we were already pissed. When happy hour ended we went to a restaurant for tea. We were then heading for the Kamikaze night club when we were given a free ticket to Ukuku's, another bar which was having a happy hour. By the time this happy hour had finished, I was totally pissed and I was asleep by about 10:30. We stayed in the bar for another couple of hours apparently during which time Ed fell over a table full of drinks cutting his forehead before totally disappearing. Dave and Roz had to carry me back to the hotel by which time there was still no sign of Ed. Gary eventually found him with the aid of a policeman sitting in another hotel minus his watch and $97 of team money. We are not sure if he was robbed or if he had to bribe the police so he wasn't arrested.

                <span class="diary-date">Tuesday, 30th Aug</span>
                Spent the day recovering and mentally preparing ourselves for the Inca Trail starting tomorrow. Gary had the worst hangover and was sick three times.

                It took us the first three days of the tour to get within 7km of Machu Pichu. The first day was easy as it consisted of a bus from our hotel to Km 82 followed by about three hours of walking. Day 2 was the most difficult day. We spent about five hours walking uphill climbing from 2800m above sea level to 4200m to reach the top of the first of three passes. The third day was also hard going as we went through the second and third passes and then descended 1000m mainly on stone steps. The altitude made the walk all the more difficult. Breathing was very difficult on some of the uphill stretches and Roz required the use of altitude sickness tablets to get her through the 2nd and 3rd days (by which time she was pretty fed up with the whole thing and was regretting ever getting involved in it).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                There were a total of 13 of us on the tour and we spent the nights sleeping in tents carried by a team of porters who also provided us with three basic but adequate meals a day.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The scenery along the walk was excellent although a lot of the time we were too worn out to really appreciate what we were walking past.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-left"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_020.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                On the fourth and final day, we were up before 6 and after breakfast, we all set off for the final 7km. The walk was flat and very easy compared to the previous two days and we got our first view of Machu Pichu shortly after 8.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                The initial view was disappointing as the ruins were hidden by cloud and were further away than we had expected them to be. However, as we walked the final 2km, the view became more and more impressive. The view as we reached the top of Machu Pichu was excellent as was the feeling of relief that we had finished the Inca Trail.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had a two hour tour of the ruins which was pretty unexciting and Gary, Roz and I all went out early to listen to Sunderland v Wolves on the World Service (There was interference when the Swansea result came through and I'm not sure if they had lost to Bradford or drawn at Cardiff).
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We had been told to meet up with our group at Aguas Calientes, about 6 - 7 km down the hill from Machu Pichu. Dave, Gary and Ed walked down while Roz and I waited for the bus and eventually got a lift down on the back of a lorry.
            </p>
            <div class="diary-photo-right"><img border="0" src="images/WT1994_021.JPG"></div>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We then spent about three hours sitting in The Inca Pizzeria playing cards, eating the best food we had seen for four days and drinking beer. Our trip included the train back from Aguas Calientes to Cuzco and this arrived at about 4:30. We had first class tickets for the train but somehow managed to end up spending the whole five hour journey stood up in the toilet taking it in turns to have our heads out of the window. Matters were made worse by the fact that despite us all being in there, the toilet was regularly used.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                We arrived back in Cuzco shortly before 10pm and walked back to our hotel. After our fist showers for four days, we all went straight to bed totally worn out.
            </p>

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 4th Sept</span>
                We had planned to spend most of the day eating, sleeping and generally recovering from the walk. However, on collecting our valuables form the hotel safe we found that Roz, Gary and I were each missing a travelers cheque, apparently stolen sometime in the previous four days. The hotel management didn't seem over concerned about the theft and were not very helpful. Roz and Gary had to phone America (reverse charge) to sort out their stolen cheques and will be issued with replacements when we arrive in Lima next week. I had Amex cheques and was able to get a replacement in about 20 minutes from their Cuzco office. It was not the end of the world having the cheques stolen but it was a lot of inconvenience that we could have done without.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                By the time everything had been sorted out, it was midday and we still hadn't had breakfast. We were all starving so had a couple of pizzas as well as a spag bol each before returning to the hotel to sleep for the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                In teh evening we decided that we deserved another session and so we went for a repeat of the one last Monday. We didn't make the same mistake as last time and didn't start drinking quite so quickly just having three doubles each during the first happy hour in the Cross Keys. From there we went to a Mexican restaurant and, after eating, we returned to Ukuku's Bar. We stayed there until after 1am drinking relatively slowly but still getting pretty pissed.
