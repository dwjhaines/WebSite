                We met up with Dave & Gary at Heathrow and, after a few swift pints in The John Bull Tavern, we boarded the 7pm flight to Paris. We had about an hour in Paris before getting aboard the 10:30 flight to Buenos Aires. After making the most of the free beer/champagne, we watched about five minutes of the film and fell asleep.

                We had stops at Rio, where we got off the plane for an hour, and at Sao Paulo. The in-flight meals during this time were just about non-existent and we were all close to starvation by the time they finally served lunch. We arrived in Buenos Aires on time at 11:30 and cleared customs with remarkable ease and speed. After the traditional argument with a taxi driver, we were taken to the Hotel O Rei in the city centre where we had arranged to meet Ed.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                Ed was nowhere to be seen when we arrived but the receptionist told us that he was staying at the hotel. We checked in, had showers and went out for lunch. This consisted of a huge plate of grilled meat and intestines, etc - more than we could eat despite Air France's catering.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">After lunch, we returned to the hotel and found Ed much to Gary's surprise.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">Buenos Aires seemed similar to a lot of European cities particularly Madrid. We decided that there was not a lot to do there so we may as well leave after one night and start heading Northwards. We walked to the bus station and booked seats on tomorrow night's bus to Posadas. We stopped for a beer on the way back to the hotel and also bought a gallon of red wine for this evening's entertainment.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent the evening drinking the wine and playing cards. When we had finished the wine, we headed out to the area around the bus station where the bars/restaurants were a lot cheaper than where we were staying. We found a bar and stayed there until we were all totally pissed. Roz and I left at around 2:30 and the others about two hours later. I don't remember going back to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">
                <span class="diary-date">Saturday, 30th July</span>
                We got up at about 9:30, half an hour before checking out. We were all still drunk as we hurriedly stuffed our things into our rucksacks before heading for the nearest McDonalds. We half-heartedly walked around looking for sights but spent most of the morning sitting in various McDonalds. After eating our lunch, we collected our rucksacks from the hotel and walked to the bus station where we had a 3 hour wait for the bus to Posadas. Apart from a quick trip out to a supermarket we spent the 3 hours sat around doing nothing. The bus pulled in at 6:15 and left on time at 6:30. Once on the bus, I was asleep with in about half an hour.

                <span class="diary-date">Sunday, 31st July</span>
                We arrived in Posadas just before 7am and immediately boarded another bus for Encarnacion in Paraguay, just the other side of the border. This journey took about an hour including the border crossing and by 9am we had booked into the Hotel Vienna ($8 each). The weather here was already much hotter than in Buenos Aires.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">So far our Spanish lessons seem to have been worthwhile. We are not exactly fluent and have difficulty understanding other people but we do seem to be able to make ourselves understood and have no problems with food accommodation or bus tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">We spent an hour or so in the hotel before walking to the bus station where we booked tickets for tomorrow mornings bus to the Iguazu Falls and then caught a local bus to Trinidad (28km away). Here we visited some Jesuit ruins - not very impressive to say the least. We were in Trinidad a total of about 50 minutes before getting a bus back to Encarnacion. We ate our second "Empanada" of the day and then returned to the hotel for the rest of the afternoon
            </p>
            <p class="diary-text">All of us were totally knackered so after an early tea, we were all asleep by about 9:00.
